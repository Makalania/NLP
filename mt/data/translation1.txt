the hon. B . Alasdair Graham : 
honourable senators , the 11 June 1997 , I I been assermenté to the Council private of the Canada in quality of Leader of the government to the Senate . 
I I said this day - that that my objective Prime was of do the necessary for that I am replaced to the first opportunity . 
in fact , I I formally said that I was without doubt the only human to the cabinet federal who would of the efforts for leave the employment . 
I not know not many of political who so the targuer of have reached their objective and work their task in half least of time that he not in must . 
the senator Boudreau is not only a friend staff of long date , this is also a friend of the family since of many years . 
and , when Bernie the is presented to the , to the direction of our party in Nova - Nova , this is a of my son who was the steering of campaign . 
, the over of the two last years , the senator Boudreau and Jack have been associated to the within of the same s of lawyers . 
honourable senators , I me ask the he would waited of say that , that where the son has failed , the father has succeeded , of way enough détournée , must - he the make , to do advance the career policy of the senator Boudreau . 
however , the senator Boudreau is all to fact able of express the own point of view and of the do point . 
as in the sectors private that public , he has known gain the respect of many Canadians of the Nova - Nova or of , . 
before and after the stay to the Assembly legislative of the Nova - Nova , the senator Boudreau the is démarqué in the practice of the right to Sydney and to Halifax . 
in quality of Minister of the Finance and , certified , of Minister of the Health , he has found the need , as this is the case in the all of the provinces and of the country , of take of the decisions very difficult . 
senator Boudreau , you finirez by understand , as this was my case , that this is a great honour and a rare privilege of sit to the within of the cabinet and of discuss freely of the questions brûlantes of appropriate , that they be of order regional , national or international . 
all these discussions comma prospective our concern common to the regard of the well - be of the people of our Nova - Nova well - rock . 
in quality of Minister regional , you seen to and of many challenges and , in this context and that in the framework of all the other questions that you someday to as Leader of the government to the Senate , you be be on my full cooperation . 
you find that members in this House some of the penseurs the more outstanding and of the parliamentarians the more dedicated to the world . 
I I been to same of see that , in the framework of the challenges that they have to and , our colleagues it to profit of the qualities very specific , of the experience unique in their kind , of the careers successful and a magnificent Ethics of the work . 
, my notice , they shared the feelings of Edward Blake , a former member who has said he there has more of a century in a speech given to the House of the Commons : 
the privileges of the Parliament are the privileges of the people , the rights of the Parliament are the rights of the people . 
, the that of a new century , these words we recall a tradition which we we inherited - a tradition inchangée to this day - and a privilege that very little of between we we the opportunity of he . 
this is the magnificent privilege of serve the people . 
this that we do here , we the do for the people of our province , of our region and of our country . 
, the over of the ninety - seven years that I I fellow to the Senate , all the bills of bill who have been reticent the have been by need and they have therefore been and améliorés . 
all the studies who have been businesses have made someone something of Special to of the segments of our society . 
this is a privilege for we of you be in our enough , and still a time , we you wish the more cordiale of the them . 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I me am always a happy of welcome to the behalf of the Opposition a new senator , but I the am always in présumant that we will all benefit of the experience and of the training of the new come until to this that the age of the retirement required the force to from . 
the senator Boudreau is the Prime senator who , before same of have been assermenté , that announced that the term of the stay among we not will not more long that this that he rest of the mandate of the government present . 
is who me place in a dilemma . 
I want wish to the senator Boudreau a long and reinforce stay here , but in same time , I hope , as many of other , that the time that the government present will to the power will also short that possible . 
in reality , I me anyway to think that after few months only , the senator off that the work work here is more productive and least partisan that to the other place and that he want can - be well review his decision of the rétrograder when the next election will there . 
only the time the will . 
between - time , he accept a challenge difficult , who the is became still more to because of the model established by the predecessor immediate , which the urbanité and the civility not have never been as implemented to the when and confirmées that during of the the days and in the intervention of today today . 
today today , I me outline of wish to the senator Boudreau the better of the opportunity in his new duties , and I the commend of the choice of the Leader Deputy . 
the senator Hays has of the respect General of the senators of the two sides of the House and made to his new duties 15 years of participation active to the business of the Senate .

the agriculture 
the hemp industrial - - obstacles to the export to the States - United 
the hon. Lorna Milne : 
honourable senators , I rise today today the speak to of draw the attention of the Senate on the situation to which are now confrontées a society and a young industry Canadian . 
Kenex Limited , to Chatham , in Ontario , is in are of become the a of the more great producers and transformateurs of hemp industrial . 
however , the Administration of the customs and of the repression of the Substances of the States - United has recently the that in calling . 
I I taken conscience of the problem after have wrote in September to several of my contacts in the sector of the hemp industrial , to of me enquérir on the crops of this year . 
the response that I I received of the share of Jean lawyer , chairman of Kenex , not has not been the that I intended . 
Mr. . lawyer me has made a assistance considerable when I I began to me with of the bill of bill on the hemp industrial . 
he me is then wished obvious that the market American issues a good reason for that . allows the culture of the hemp industrial to the Canada . 
well that the market American for the products of hemp gross and last be very important , the States - United have long , the culture of the hemp industrial , of so that , during of the years , the market has dépendu of the worth of the abroad . 
recently , several States have adopted of the laws encouraged the culture of the hemp industrial - which Hawaii , the Crosby of the North and the Minnesota . 
a time that a done the a share of the market , he has trend to maintain this advantage initial ; he is therefore to our producers Canadian of take and of maintain their share of market before that the Americans not the the approprient . 
the market American represents realistic per of the figure of Affairs of Kenex . 
the a of his customers , a society which the figure of Affairs is of 2 billion of $ by year , using since of the years of the seeds of hemp from of China for his mélanges . 
the chargement of seeds for invading that Kenex has delivered in August to this society has been before by the customs U.S. . 
this chargement was informed of documents confirmant his sterilization and the analysis of the THC . 
the seeds for invading are of the " seeds of hemp stérilisées " , who not are not a substance réglementée , what that be their substance in THC . 
the seeds of hemp of Kenex are all to fact legal to the " of the bill Canadian . 
they are least of 0,001p. per , or a part by per $ , of THC . 
the bill Canadian allows until to tenths per of THC in the seeds stérilisées . 
Mr. . lawyer has said : 
he is impossible of find of the trace of THC in our products to least that the laboratory not be équipé for do of the tests of presence of THC until to a part by million , and still that , . not can find of the trace of THC in the most of our products . 
Cynthia H . Thielen , MP of the state of Hawaii to the House of the representatives , has formally made the support to Kenex Limited and has criticized openly the participation of the Administration American of the repression of the Substances to the back of the products of Kenex . 
honourable senators , I believe know that the Department of the Affairs foreign and of the Trade international the before on the matter and I will follow of close the evolution . 
I hope that we will very soon of good new to announce to the farmers Canadian .

question PERIOD PERIOD 
the Corporation of development of the Cape - Cape 
the possible of bills for help the amends to meet the conditions of Eligibility to the Program of your to the retirement has - - Position of the government 
the hon. John Buchanan : 
honourable senators , before of question my question , I like wish the welcome to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
the life is strange . 
the last time that I I sat in a House with the senator Boudreau , I occupais the seat in opposite of the fun . 
I was sitting of the side of the part government in as that Prime Minister and he was of the side of the Opposition . 
I am happy that we we end in the same Position , except that the roles are overthrow . 
I the well work with the hon. senator during of long years . 
he is possible that he be of this side - that during few years , but after the next election federal , this will me who siégerai of this side - that and him of this side - this . 
I am a man very sympathetic , and the hon. senator Boudreau the knows . 
I like question to the Leader of the government to the Senate a question on a about who him the to heart and who me the to heart since of many years . 
that has relates to the Corporation of development of the Cape - Cape , the Devco . 
I know that the hon. senator told also very that the senator Graham for defend the Devco , of the least I the hope . 
my question the quoted to the situation to the mine of coal of Phalen . 
. is in are of démonter the line of tightening and the levels lower of the mine . 
the amends ear that the branch Superior of the mine of Phalen not will not affected , because . there find still about 7,5 million of tonnes of coal which between 5 and 6 million of tonnes of coal récupérable in the sectors 1A west , 2A west , 1QZ , 2QZ , and that 1Y and 2Y . 
the United Moon Allied of America and the other unions represented to the Devco ear that the government federal overcome good of the let operating the mine to the over of the next years , to that the amends so work a number sufficient of years for have right to their pension to the end of the period of two years . 
other , the mine will closed and the workers not will not right to their pension . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate raise he , as that possible , this question with the Prime Minister , to that the amends so continue of work to the mine of coal of Phalen and of operating these 5 to 6 million of tonnes of coal récupérable ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the senator for his question . 
as the hon. senator we the has if well reminded , we we already lived a situation similar , except that I Chronicle the questions and that he connecting the answers . 
the senator Buchanan : 
this is exactly , and you obteniez always the good response . 
the senator Boudreau : 
the hon. senator will can - be the situation current more pleasant . 
before of answer to the question of the hon. senator , I like comment the comments made all to the time . 
this is with many of humility that I I agreed the responsibilities who me have been confiées , of as more that my predecessor the has assumed of way remarkable . 
I wishes of , the in thank to the behalf of the Senate and of the people of the Canada . 
honourable senators , I I also been very affected by the words of welcome and the advice that me has easier the Leader of the Opposition , who me has proposed , between other , of reconsidered the term of my stay to this vénérable institution that is the Senate . 
I him attention that , to this about , he has the support total of my wife . 
in response to the question raised by the hon. senator Buchanan , I contend that the Devco will to the centre of my concerns during any the term of my mandate present . 
we know all two the matter since a period considerable . 
he fact now the subject of a approach in two steps . 
the first is to find a solution hon. for the resources human who working in this sector since of many years . 
this question is a great importance not only for these people , but also for all the senators and for the government of the Canada . 
the other step , well course , is to promote the development economic for help the community to the adapt to the transition in over . 
human not knows better that the senator who has asked the question that he the is that of a his transition between a economy industrial who is linked of a unique employer and a economy post - industrial . 
a such transition not is never easy . 
in this who respect the question proprement refer , I bring course this concern . 
I say however that the approach who is to transfer the resources to a exploitant of the sector private is in over . 
all the world seems the hear for say that he the Glenney of the better way of which to the situation . 
if the resources houillères can be incorporated and exploited surely , effectively and economically , I am sure that the new exploitant of the sector private will the proposal very seriously . 
the senator Buchanan : 
honourable senators , I not speak not of the privatization . 
I I my own opinion to this regard . 
the problem that pose the 5 to 6 million of tonnes of coal récupérable , this is that , if the direction of Devco sphere to remove the line of tightening until to the sections higher of the houillère Phalen and beyond - beyond , he risk of be too later for that a exploitant of the sector private can selective this coal . 
if a exploitant of the sector private so to the do , this is very well , but he will then that the amends who will this work to the over of the two next years so be always eligible to the benefits of retirement . 
as the hon. senator the knows , with the closure of the mine Phalen , a great number of amends not are not including in the formula regarding the program of your to the retirement has . 
the mine Phalen has closed before that human not that arisen his closure and this is the problem who we ' now . 
I like also question the senator to the about of the someone 1 160 amends who will affected by the closure of the mine Phalen . 
the process of évincement has already began with the houillère Prince . 
the men who have been Earmarked when the mine Phalen has closed and those who the roles of the maintenance of this mine have évincé the workers of the houillère Prince , which about 250 have received their notice of implementation to at . 
when . add these men - this to the other , that fact someone 1 per amends who not receive no Benefit of retirement , there including those who have 20 years of rotunda , but who not are not enough seniors for have 75 points . 
I find that very unfair and this is this that find also the chairman and the members of the executive of the United Moon Allied . 
he must find a way for to these people - that eligible to the Program of your to the retirement has . 
a bill is possible and this would very simple . 
of the senators not know not that a enormous operation of Municipality the is to the Devco . 
the same something worth for the Sydney Steel Corporation , the he the happened someone something that - there . 
the prospect to the Devco will about 150 million of $ . 
this program is considered to the time current as to strong prevalence not not of with - material Bill , but of equipment . 
I ask to the new Minister of to the question the more earlier possible with the Prime Minister . 
be said in way , to the over of the campaign election provincial in Nova - Nova , the Prime Minister has advocates a letter to Ms Edna Budden and to the women of the amends their saying that he would to the officials of the Department of examine all the aspects of the Program of your to the retirement has . 
I know the he the has fact , but that must be fact for that these men not be not all simply caught for the . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , as not the know not the senator , the program launched by the government has been doubly affected by the closure premature of the mine . 
of first , of the people who would had right to the Program of your to the retirement has , because that they had reached the rotunda necessary , not have not could there have access to because of the closure premature of the - this . 
they have lost the time additionnel which they had need for the what and have therefore been affected very directly . 
then , the program has also been affected because that the society continued on the income who would been generated by the and of the mine for this period . 
, because of these two consequences of the closure premature of the mine , the government has esteemed necessary of examine the program who had been proposed he there has someone time to the amends and to their families . 
this review is always in over . 
I I good confidence that we able do someone something for improve the situation , in particular for the groups which we come of speak and who have been directly affected by the closure premature of the mine . 
I hope that the Prime Minister and the ministers these will find a solution to this case . 
I bring certainly your interest and your comments also well that the pale .

the hon. Marjory LeBreton : 
honourable senators , I wishes , me also , wish the welcome to the new Leader of the government to the Senate . 
and of a " bad management bid in the of fisheries " . 
honourable senators , the words that I just of deal are those of none other that the former Prime Minister Liberal of the New - Brunswick , Frank McKenna , such that quotations in the Globe and Mail of the 5 October 99 . 
he has said then : 
the record of the government is still least reluisant today today that he not the was to the time of the election ( in 1997 ) ... 
this that the ( Canadians of the Atlantic ) want , the only something that they looking and have always demandée to the government federal , this is a vision , a may 3.2 that he recognizes the problem and a ray of hope ... ... ... . 
that has fact the government for deal these serious problems ? 
he has composed 911 and asked the senator Bernie Boudreau . 
then , about of first of the Nova - Nova . 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
he the is of the road EH in Nova - Nova , who has been the into of a real carnage and the because of many Late . 
in his quality of Minister responsible of the Nova - Nova , that does do the Leader of the government for which to this sad situation ? 
is - he prepared to the Engage and to local that the government will spend a bill of infrastructure federal to the Reconstruction and to the renewal of the sections affiliated Mudslide of laroute EH ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I me told when these words Mr. McKenna would ramenées on the been . 
I me am of the fact that , in the speech of the Throne presented yesterday , he be question of way very impressive and effective of the vision that he évoquait . 
of the talks are now in over with the Minister of the Transport relatively to the infrastructure routières . 
in the speech of the Throne , he is question of the infrastructure physical traditional and of those in the area of the Communications . 
I find that encouraged . 
that the inscrira perfectly in the plan of the government federal , then that the Nova - Nova the without to enter in the new millennium . 
I debate certainly of the question with the Minister . 
the senator LeBreton : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the government to the Senate sharing he the notice expressed by the former - Prime Minister McKenna ? 
good number of those who have already borrowed this road know of what he is question . 
he the is of a section highway extremely dangerous , as he in there of , in of other regions of our country . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the senator me ask if I sharing the notice Mr. McKenna who , of male , has already been my associated in a s of lawyers . 
I not praiseworthy not the hon. senator in him saying that , on this point , I not am not of agreed Mr. McKenna . 
this is indéniable that the prosperity general who has been created in our country is almost without precedent . 
the Governor of the Bank of the Canada believe that the growth of our economy to the over of the four the trimestres is Superior to 4 per , this who not the is never seen . 
however , despite this growth remarkable , our rate of inflation rest consistent to the objectives under - this who is a achievement because . 
certainly , this achievement not the is not concrétisé also in all the regions of our country . 
Mr. . McKenna wanted can - be do an the situation of way flamboyante . 
I must however say to the honourable senators that to well of the places of the Canada Atlantic , the data on the creation of jobs and the unemployment indicate clear that the prosperity the is reference . 
she not is can - be not also important that we the souhaiterions and not the can - be not fact feel across , but we continue of into of the efforts in this sense . 
we hope that , this by , we able be on the support Mr. McKenna . 
by , , I know very well the road in question . 
I the I empruntée to again opportunities . 
the system highway Main of the Nova - Nova , who has including bénéficié of the funding of the government federal , is in enough good of , same the he not is not perfect across . 
he we must recognize the role that the senator Buchanan has played to this regard . 
the province of the Nova - Nova has a good system highway , but I the said , he not is however not perfect . 
the hon. senator has spoke of a road who require of the improvements . 
I not doubt not that the Minister of the Transport here of the question with the counterpart provincial in this the . 
the Environment 
the Nova - Nova - - prospect of the étangs bitumeux of Sydney 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , my question the question also to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
he will noticed without doubt that our first questions for the to to the when them on the region that he knows the better . 
I not will not of comments on the authorized to we the questions that we him we raised until to now . 
number of my friends environnementalistes working of however - at since long for draw the attention of the government on this question . 
in fact , Mr. Don Deleskie , a particular , has same fact the extend of the hunger . 
he has , of more , undertaken of décontaminer the étangs to the assistance of a simple pelle . 
before that the Minister will to the question , I like him say that , recently , the Senate has adopted a bill of bill first who not with or of the enlèvement or of the production of products chemical toxic dangerous as the PCB who the find in this place tainted . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank her the senator of his question . 
in fact , I thank all the senators of question of the questions on a region that I know enough well . 
I know well the question of the étangs bitumeux of Sydney . 
in the past , he there has had of the attempts of with of the étangs bitumeux . 
some of between they have cost very sir and not have not given of good results . 
. has spent many of money for not obtain that of thin results . 
the two levels of government , what that be their affiliation policy , have tried of impose of the solutions to the community . 
these attempts have also failed . 
however , this time - this , in the framework of this important initiative , the government federal , with the assistance of the government provincial , implementation someone 62 million of $ for begin this who , we the hope , should be the regulation final of this problem . 
however , the the of the experience of the past , experience who not was not very plaisante or culmination , he has been decided of do participate the community to the research of a solution to this problem . 
the solution proposed had of the community . 
the problem with this way of do this is that the - this require of the time . 
he is many more quick of impose a solution that of seek to obtain a consensus to the within of the community . 
by therefore , a group Joint composed of representatives of various sectors of the community has been the on at . 
the government federal has participated to a program , jointly with the government provincial , and those - this the are engaged to provide 62 million of $ , which 70 per erroneous of the federal . 
a commitment important has been taken . 
the group Joint is on the point of complete the first step of the work and he hope that of the measures corrective will be taken the more quickly possible . 
that worth the only of out this consensus to the within of the community . 
I I seen of the case where the . has deliberation for the other solution and the results obtained not have not been very palatable . 
the principles of the payment by the sign , of the prevention of the pollution and of the Elimination step of the products chemical toxic - - Position of the government 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , a consensus to the within of the community is a something wonderful . 
however , in this case - this the responsibility of this who the is happened not can certainly not be imputée to the community . 
this is the company who has left a mess . 
the the of the bill of bill that we come of adopt , the Leader of the government support he personally the principles according which the pollueur must pay and , particularly , the Elimination step of the manufacturing , of the production and of the use of such products chemical toxic , to that in the future we not we more face to this problem ? 
in way , . has lost as of time with the solutions cut by the government and without consensus local that the little of time that he would for , to this consensus not is not a about of concern . 
I like have a idea of the opinion of the Minister of the Nova - Nova , Leader of the government to the Senate , on the principles very important of the pollueur - is , of the prevention of the pollution and , more important still , of the Elimination step of the use and of the production of the most of the products chemical toxic . 
. just fair of discover that the use to the broad of the British - British have a rate very high of wastes in their body , this who is result to the production and to the use of many products chemical . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the participation local and the they of a consensus local have been made to the two levels of government by the community . 
the government the is the to these requêtes . 
this is a process very valid and necessary , same the he ralentit a little the progress on the ground . 
for this who is of the other question raised by the hon. senator , I say that he has was per years for Establishing the étang of tar . 
. not would not a such pollution the build today today . 
I not I no point of disagreement majeur with this that has said the hon. senator . 
I like well discuss of this about more in full with she , but nothing of this that she has said not me " particularly . 
we not must never allow that a such situation the said . 
the senator Spivak : 
honourable senators , I am pleased of see that the Leader of the government to the Senate is to the least with we that he must eliminate phase the manufacturing of the most of the products chemical toxic . 
thank for this statement very evident . 
the agriculture 
the effectiveness of the programs to to help the farmers 
the hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , I wish me also the welcome to the new Leader of the government to the Senate and I him wish all the success possible . 
my question the on a about that he knows well . 
the farmers of the Nova - Nova have or three years of drought . 
the program that the government has the on at not the has not drafting . 
he pays to the farmers 70 per of the average of their income of the three last years . 
honourable senators , 70 per of nothing , this is zero . 
the Leader of the government is - he to the aware of that ? 
in the affirmative , that will he to this regard ? 
I want also him attention the situation in Saskatchewan , in Alberta and to the Manitoba . 
the farmers are here to Ottawa since three days . 
they are a situation of crisis to the Canada . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate us he this message to the cabinet and insistera he on the uniqueness none of the problem of dispute national which our country is such in some sectors of the industry agricultural ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I know that the senator Gustafson just of the Saskatchewan . - months last , I I had the opportunity of me to to Regina to as of member of the board of Administration of the Bank of the Canada , service that I occupais to the time . 
during of this visit , we we been the to the aware of the situation of the agriculture in the Prairies by the leaders of the sector agricultural and by of the economists . 
same if I not understand course not also well the situation that the senator , I am when same in legislation of understand the difficulties who exist and the desire of the farmers of have of the rules of the stake field . 
the governments federal and provincial have provided a assistance Supplementary of 1.5 billion of $ to the farmers in the framework of the Program of assistance in case of disaster linked to the income agricultural . 
a part of the difficulty the to the fact that , until to this day , only 190 million of $ have been paid to the farmers . 
however , to the end of the year , we anticipate that the determined questionable 550 million of $ . 
the pace will the speed and he is to hope that the problem talked by the senator the lessen someone little . 
the senator Gustafson : 
honourable senators , I thank the Minister of his response . 
the problem , this is that the program ACRA not works not . 
the formula not is not good , as the know the senators of the two sides of the House who come of the Prairies and of the Nova - Nova . 
she not works all simply not because that she the based on 70 per of the income way of the three last years . 
the farmer who has known three bad years of the is really in difficulty . 
the program not the déclenchera not in the case . 
this is that a of the major problems . 
the government must there the appropriation some of way to this that the . can there have access . 
this is that a about of concern national . 
the country not can the allow of losing his farmers . 
. we has said yesterday last that of 30 $ to 40 $ farmers could do bankrupt . 
the problem is a such emergency that he Order a intervention immediate . 
of the button professionals agricultural have sought to reach the Prime Minister . 
the Prime Minister Trudeau not was not the human the more rock in the Western , as the Minister the knows , but he the is the to Regina , in Saskatchewan . It the is the in the chorus Work to the legislative legislative , and the farmers not the have not very well treaty . 
they him have launched of the Wheat to the found . 
however , he the is indeed presented . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate will he the please of say to the Prime Minister that the farmers want that he the votes on the situation in the area agricultural ? 
the senator Boudreau :

, the Excellency the very hon. Adrienne Clarkson , Chancelière and Compagnon Main of the Order of the Canada , Chancelière and Commandeur of the Order of the Mérite military , Gouverneure general and Commandante in Leader of the Canada . 
QU' IL PLAISE , VOTRE EXCELLENCE : 
we , issues very dedicated and issue of Majesty Majesty , the Senate of the Canada , assemblés in Parliament , prions respectfully Honour Excellency of entertain our humbles thanks for the Gratia speech that her has advocates to the two Houses of the Parliament . 
essential to the framework of proposals that she has made in the speech , this who makes good number of between they possible in fact , are the surpluses , current and cash , registered in the accountable of the Canada . 
. is far of the painful battle seeing against the debt grew who , he not there has not if long still , we privait of opportunities , bouleversait our priorities and assombrissait our future . 
through to the sacrifice contribute by all the Canadians and through to the determination and to the excellent management of our government , we is face to the choice very different certainly , but ô how exaltants of know to what areas orienter the resources paramount of the people Canadian . 
we know all that he there among the great public , the media and our own parties political of many ideas , of many dreams , of many priorities and of many ways different of , to the same objectives . 
he responsibility to our government of listen all the world carefully , of do his own studies and Evaluations and , finally , of decide of a plan of action . 
this is of after the plan of action that he the will set and the effectiveness of the enforcement that he will felt . 
of more , this is of the quality of his decisions and of his actions that depend the well - be of the Canada and of the Canadians . 
the Gouverneure general has spoke of the questions that the government has the intention of take and of the doors who can now the open - of the doors the sloppily to the Canada on a future better and more interesting for the first generations of Canadians of the next millennium . 
these doors indicate " Entrée " , and not " Sortie " . 
they the leaves on of the opportunities , and not on of the walls . 
they are the access to of the Diaspora are , to the education , to the research , to of the jobs productive and gratifiants . 
the Gouverneure general has indicated this that the Canada the move of do for the Canadians to the over of the years to come and has explained why our country believe that these objectives are important . 
today today , honourable senators , I like you body a word of the way which I see our country - of the past , of the present and certainly of the future , such that I the conçois . 
this is for me a honour and a great happy of power take the speak in response to the speech of the Throne . 
as I just of announce that I finish you do share of my wish personal , he is important that I the at with be . 
since my arrived to the Senate , I understand better the real sense of these long ; then let - me of you describe the manner - or rather the ways - which I mine our country . 
he there has all of first a question of geography , which is crucial . 
I opposite to the centre of the Canada . 
same if this statement can choquer good number of people in this city , and of many other to Toronto , this is however true . 
the centre - city of Winnipeg not is that to 20 minutes of the centre longitudinal of the Canada . 
this not is not only a singularité geographical , this is also a reality calibre . 
that means that he there has two fuseaux horaires to the west and two and half - even three - to the is . 
that means that the half west of our province reflects the great foreign and the great beauty of the Prairies while that the the finding to the is is formulate ancrée in the Bouclier Canadian . 
. not can live where I opposite , between the Saskatchewan and the Ontario , without have of the country a perception different of those that in have of the people least favorisées . 
honourable senators , I me hasten of you assure of fear that you not confondiez our situation geographical with the opprobrium or the insularité . 
our links Cultural and linguistic with the Quebec are formulate enracinés in the community franco - manitobaine established to St. - Boniface . 
during any the history of the Canada , she has been the a of the two communities of language and of culture French the more important to the outside of the Quebec . 
our institutions cultural - of the sectors of the into , of the flagship and of the music - the are learning a Fame international and are enracinées in a rich mixture of groups Parliamentarians . 
our world of the Affairs , built in more of a century of trade international of products of basic and now rich of the contribution of the new technologies , is a of the more open on the outside . 
we by the world world as our market natural . 
our producers , old and négociants understand since long the reality of the globalization who their uniting well . 
the place of the Manitoba in the world has can - be found the illustration the more éclatante in the Games panaméricains remarkably work who the are held home we the been last . 
this was the event the more important of the kind of any the history of the Canada and the third in importance to the be the where that this be in the world . 
nothing not would better known we explain to the Canada and to the world world . 
honourable senators , same if I seems Zion for my strong in by these last comments , this not was not my intention . 
I wish simply to remind that the Manitoba and Winnipeg are of the elements there of the Canada present , of where he is important of having and of comment the major questions who the pose . 
though without malice , this Appendix , if she not is not been in question , risk of lead to a regrettable incompréhension of the country , of his needs and of his opportunities . 
our Fathers of the Confederation have including this danger and have designed the Senate of manner to ensure a representation balanced of all the regions . 
those of between we who not come not of great centres of people we the duty and the responsibility of speak firmly and often , as to the Senate that to the committees , of such so that all the Canadians the do hear . 
I rise also today today as member of a generation in particular , this who conditionne essentially my point of view . 
I am unborn to the enter of the War War World , of so that some events and some ideas of this time and of the years who have immediately followed are always costs to my memory . 
I I fact my studies particularly in the fantastiques years 50 , decade which . has fact the least of case in this century . 
I I undertaken my first activities political fair to the time where Lester Pearson he the direction of the Party Liberal of the Canada . 
of , , this is to the over of a evening remember in company Mr. Pearson , then Leader of the Opposition , and of a small group to Winnipeg , to the end of the years 50 , that I me am committed for the life to the Party Liberal . 
I I of first worked as official on the Hill to Ottawa , during Mr. Pearson was Prime Minister . 
incidentally , I not can me prevent of out that , same the he has been Leader of the government during to only five years and the he not has never led a government majority , Mr. Pearson has changed and enriched the Canada for always . 
in by this statement , I think to the great programs social that him and the government we have opinions . 
that said , he me is came the other day still of think that he is well difficult of imagine the Canada in 99 without our flag insufficient . 
for well of the Canadians , this act of may will policy and of pride for the Canada in the era Pearson . 
I I also been witness of the for Mr. Trudeau and of the debut of the remarkable leadership . 
Ottawa was became a pôle of poles for the young men and the young women , did of energy and of ideas , who believed that all was possible and that the Canada was the place where this was achievable . 
no of those - and he there in has several in this chamber today today - who were here to this time and who have shared the experience of these years not can never the forget and , who more is , not has never since known a such effervescence in our country . 
he there has a something fundamental that we we apprise then : not never under - Number the Canada and not never , to the great never , under - Number the importance and the Oath of the idea of the Canada for the Canadians and for the people of the world world . 
honourable senators , the he is a remember that I Custody of the years 1966 to 1969 , this is the remarkable sentiment of optimism who the dégageait of across and who imprégnait all a each . 
it 67 was the expression impressive and hers of the confidence of the Canada in itself and in his place in the world . 
, the reflection , I me so now the of the power enormous of a such sentiment of confidence and of optimism and that of the source incredible of energy that he can be for a country and his people . 
today today , I not can me prevent of consider the force of the Canada and of the economy , the absence of all conflict international of dispute , the revolution époustouflante who the prepares in the area of the Science and of the Technology and that the puissante combination of all these factors who , together , not can that improve the quality and the foreign of the life of all the Canadians and of the almost 6 billion of people human who shared our world , without repeated a time of more , and still more intensément , this same optimism who me animait when , young man , I am came on the Hill of the Parliament . 
finally , honourable senators , I me timely to from of the point of view of someone a who is to the Senate since very little of time . 
I am came here he there has a little more of a year for about a new career . 
same if I had a training of lawyer , to the over of the 30 years previous I I been a man of Affairs who the is tried of build a business acted the activity to the Canada and , . 
this by , I I many learned on the realities of the community of the Affairs and on the operating of our economy . 
I I learned that he was essential of have of the people producing and well ensured in all the disciplines . 
I I learned that the leadership is a jurisdiction exigée and implemented to all the levels by any business prosperous . 
I I learned that the pride such relatively to a company and to his products is a key fundamental of the success and that the pride that a human having to the regard of the country grandit without has when our products and services are exportés a little across in the world . 
honourable senators , we must continue of from the better party of our closest and of our links of friendship and continue of avoid the traps associated to the inégalités in the foreign and in the the social . 
he in is and since that Sir John A . Macdonald has fact a first assessment of our future , and that not has never been also true that today today . 
we , Canadians , must stay firmly attachment to our values and to our identity . 
a society who not is éprise or of justice or of compassion not cannot truly advance . 
however , as the country of the chorus are of more in more closely linked , we must we focus on the needs special of the st century .

I wish to wish the welcome to the senator Boudreau , who the the relais to as of Leader . 
I manquerais to my duty , honourable senators , if I not félicitais our Gouverneure general for the speech of the Throne that she has given yesterday . 
his accomplishments to as of communicatrice , journalist and advocate of many causes valid in have fact a of the major figures of our country . 
I am very enthousiasmé by the perspective of see his into and the spirit animer the position chairman - Alaska to the over of the next years . 
honourable senators , this is a honour and a privilege of participate to the life public to this time of our history , a time where the challenges are of size and the opportunities stimulantes , a era of globalization and of hopeful technologique . 
we are indeed to few weeks of a new millennium . 
the time not is not only exaltante for the country all world , she in also a point turning for Newfoundland - Newfoundland and the Labrador . 
these the months of 99 constitute all naturally a time of v. during which the Newfoundland - alter réfléchiront to the place that they roles to the within of the country and to their prospects of future . 
today today , Newfoundland - Newfoundland and the Labrador the people in the tourmente of the great changes technological and economic who balayent the world . 
the people of this region not the suggest however not just ; they are call to their skills and to their learning of long date for do opposite to the realities of the change quick . 
through to their creativity , their resort , their solidarity , their determination and their fiercely to the work , they if their dreams and choose to the before their province and their country . 
the statistics economic recent we in say long on the evolution of our province . 
the Conference Board of the Canada has out that the rate of growth real of the GDP of Newfoundland - Newfoundland , who the one to 5,2p. per , is the more high to the Canada . 
the prospects of employment the améliorent also , because the rate of unemployment has decreased of more of 2.5 points since the year last . 
the honourable senators are to the aware of the benefits of mégaprojets as Hibernia , the be of the over on of the Churchill and the possible and of the impact of Voisey' s Bay . 
these great bills are cruciaux for the success economic of Newfoundland - Newfoundland , but the history is far of the complete that . 
in all the jurisdictional of the economy , of the companies of our province remportent of the success of more in more éclatants . 
certainly , the industries traditional as the and mining and of the Forestry and the fisheries would of the elements essential to our well - be economic . 
but that not must not do forget the real dynamic of diversification who has began to the dramatically . 
of the companies implantées home we are their in in of the areas as the Communications , the technical manufacturières of forefront and the management of the PCB dangerous . 
honourable senators , the a of the sectors of growth the more important to Newfoundland - Newfoundland , these last years , has been the tourism , and the trend should the maintain . 
" evening 99 " , who out the contribution of Newfoundland - Newfoundland to the Canada in this fiftieth anniversary of the into in the Confederation , has been a éclatant success to the the national . 
his festivals , his than and his other activities , including the taken " of the turn of the CN , the been last , have known a frank success . 
these activities have contributed to prepare the next great Women , in 2000 , the of the millième anniversary of the arrived of the Viking in the New third . 
the Games of Winter of the Canada of 99 , held to Corner Brook , have also won enormous of success . 
qualifiées of the a of the best éditions of these games , the intellectual have fact discover our province to the téléspectateurs and to the visitors of the together of the country . 
the success of the Games of Winter of the Canada , honourable senators , example the a of the major forces of Newfoundland - Newfoundland that I wish to mention , be the spirit generous , ingénieux , bienveillant and warmest of the Newfoundland - alter . 
. said often that the indicators economic not backed not , to them only , to illustrate this who fact a great society . 
the Canada not is not became the great country that he is today today only in reason of the performance economic . 
he is obvious that of the political economic solid and responsible play a role important , and the government land - neuvien all as the government federal should be félicités for their record in this area . 
the were of our province and of our country not the however not only to their performance economic . 
this who fact of the Canada a country where he fact good live , this who the topic of the States - United , this who in fact the envy of the world world , this is the great passion of the Canadians who want understand and protect all the members vulnerable of their society , all those who not are not in legislation of take be of them - same . 
honourable senators , he not must never take that to the lightly if we want continue of do the envy of the my world . 
we must continually seek to aviver this great passion of the Canadians and never the let the éteindre . 
this is to Newfoundland - Newfoundland and to the Labrador that these values are the better illustrées , honourable senators . 
the quality of life of the Newfoundland - alter today any legislation economic conventionnelle , because he is impossible of credit a price to the spirit community , to the expression cultural and to the compassion . 
he not fact no doubt , honourable senators , that the quality of life is directly linked to the nature generous and charitable of a society . 
according the skills national of 1997 on the don , the they and the participation , the people of Newfoundland - Newfoundland and of the Labrador listed still a time among the citizens the more generous of the Canada . 
more of the third of the people has given of the time to of the his of more . 
the Newfoundland - alter affichaient the more very rate of contribution financial to of the agencies of more to the Canada , 84p. per of the people of Newfoundland - Newfoundland of more of 15 years to fact of the donations for help them . 
this generosity of spirit , in despite often of time difficult , is profoundly enracinée in the history of Newfoundland - Newfoundland . 
this is the of people who are of great revers since 500 years and that the individual tie together to the place of the from . 
Érosion : 
honourable senators , he the what well of the things positive today today to Newfoundland - Newfoundland and to the Labrador , but many of challenges remain to and and many of problems , to solve . 
he is very encouraged of see that the government federal the undertake , in the speech of the Throne , to the deal to these problems . 
I wish to speak here of two problems in particular . 
the Prime is the problem of the drain of the Newfoundland - alter . 
many of families of Newfoundland - Newfoundland and of the Labrador have the pain of see from of the friends and of the families for of other parties of the Canada and of the world . 
the decline of the people to the 1 July last was the more there never registered since the closure of the fishing on the Grand Pott , but he is still too high . 
he is encouraged of see that the Prime Minister Tobin and the government are IT to this problem and profoundly to the relieve . 
he is encouraged also , honourable senators , of see that the government federal the undertake , in the speech of the Throne , not only to work to keep the young Canadians to the Canada , but also to do know that the Canada is really the better place where live to the st century , a place where the best and the more brilliant in the rest of the world want come live . 
the commitment to invest of the funds in the research , the businesses beneficial and the skills of the skills will greatly the young of Newfoundland - Newfoundland and of across to the Canada to stay in their country for there continue their dreams . 
we we a challenge closely to and , honourable senators , the of continue to improve the quality of the education dispensé to our young and that the opportunities of there access . 
the young Canadians of Newfoundland - Newfoundland and of , ear from the better party of these new opportunities for power be self . 
they not can the do without a assistance get in the of education . 
the University Memorial of Newfoundland - Newfoundland famous , in 99 , the fiftieth anniversary in as that to " spirituality of the diplômes . 
since 50 years , the University Memorial has played a role capital in the development of Newfoundland - Newfoundland and of the Labrador . 
same if the access to a education of quality dispensé by the University Memorial and by of other institutions academic and collégiaux of the Canada the is expanded to the over of the years , of many students of Newfoundland - Newfoundland and of across to the Canada not can about of the studies post to because of obstacles financial as the lack of funds and the costs of tuition high . 
of many other are forced of abandon their studies before of the have completed to because of problems as the enormous debt of the students . 
honourable senators , I know these problems for the have vécus personally . 
without the opportunity extraordinary that has behalf for me the tuition gratuite instaurée in the years 60 by the Prime Minister Joey of the time and the government , I think that I not would not in legislation of do this intervention to the Senate today today . 
fortunately , good number of the investment who have been announced in the speech of the Throne and who improve to improve the productivity and to struggle against the drain of the drain will orientés to the universities Canadian , to the support of the activities of research and development in of the areas as the care of health and the high Technology . 
7.02 to of the initiatives as the Fund of staffing of the scholarships of studies of the millennium , these new resources these greatly to to the education post more accessible to the students . 
for power follow a training avancée , the children must power grow in a community course where their needs basic are satisfied and they must be encouraged to the supplying and to benefit to the safeguarded of their studies International and high . 
as the senators the know , he there has too of children who live in the poverty to the Canada . 
the he not there had that a only child poor to the Canada , that would despite all they to the extraordinary fabric social of our country . 
if the Canada to succeed on the plans social and economic in the future , he him must come to across of the poverty home the children . 
honourable senators , as . the has seen enough clear in the speech of the Throne , the condition of the children is to the order of the day of the concerns of the government . 
. has many stressed on the measures that the government the take for improve the fate of the children to the country . 
in uphold the programs current such the credit of tax for children , the program of food of the new - Regarding and the congés parentaux , our government the is committed to take of the measures urgently . 
the cooperation with the governments provincial in view of coordinating the offer of these programs and services is to the basic same of the success of this initiative . 
honourable senators , when of the people of a little across to the world come visit Newfoundland - Newfoundland , as the rest of the Canada of , , a great part of this who the draw home we is the beauty of our Oceans , of our Forestry , of our mountains and of our rivers . 
if we want maintain the reputation of the Canada to as of country of a incredible beauty and of a great diversity environmentally , we must do more for protect the Environment natural , there including the many cash of plantes and of animals which the existence is danger by the invasion human in their habitat . 
honourable senators , we to Newfoundland - Newfoundland know better that anyone that when the balance of the nature is bousculé , the impact on the people can be dévastatrices and of great dispute . 
this is therefore with many of enthusiasm that I her the efforts of the government in view of protect the integrity of our systems empathize . 
through to of the measures to to reduce the put of gas toxic and to adopt of the regulations of together on the cash species of bill , the Canada will in legislation of respect his commitments opposite to the generations future in this who has relates to the legislation of our history natural . 
honourable senators , to the over of the campaign election of 1997 , the government has promised to the Canadians that the half of the advantageous budget would so to of new Estimates in the priorities Social and that the other half would divided between of the small of tax targeted and the would of the debt national . 
in the speech of the Throne , the government has réaffirmé that this commitment figurera in the next budget . 
this is a good new for all the Canadians who have or of the years of cuts of the programs and of the services without - of tax same . 
he any in addition of not not forget the importance of intangibles the debt national . 
if this not is not a surprise for the senators , he in will other of a myriad of Canadians who are surprise of learn that the more great expenditure of the government of the Canada is ; by the service of the debt national - which the one to someone 40 billion of $ by year ; all this money could be more useful the he was spent other , but we not can not the do as that the debt not will not been 883,000 . 
a approach balanced is essential in the economy mondialisée of today today , a economy who the equip quickly and who is in Girl evolution . 
the powers public must therefore be more flexibles and capable of adopt more of representations strategic opposite to the challenges . 
this is essential if we want adhérer to these values who we about of the rest of the world . 
in our quality of parliamentarians , we must urge and invite all the levels of government to not never losing of view the major values Canadian who we distinguent , because the he continues of there point of the caught - for - the in our society , the he continues of there have of the children been , the he continues of there have a lack of care of health for our patients and our people seniors and the he continues of there have of the shortages , even of the failure , in our systems of education , which not parviennent not to provide of the opportunity playing to all the Canadians , this is any the society who in systemic . 
the great poet English John Donne the has very well said in the short , but rending Smart " Island déserte " . 
in as that member of the great society Canadian , I urge all the senators to listen the last strophe of this Smart and to interpeller the conscience collective Canadian who must always the be if we want we remember of these values who we distinguent : 
and , by therefore , not cherchez never to know for who " the " , because he " for you . 
the keeping of the approach of the government in the of questions public will vital if the . to that the government retained a role positive and compassionate auXXIe century . 
I am enthousiasmé by the initiatives announcements in the speech of the Throne and by the opportunities the appearing to Newfoundland - Newfoundland and to the Canada , to the approach of the st century . 
honourable senators , I forward with forward of work with each of between you for do in so that the Canada be really the better place where live to the st century .

the fisheries and the Oceans 
the provinces marine - - judgment of the Court Supreme confirmant the rights of fishing aboriginal 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I you ask of you show a little indulgents , the time that I one a word on the situation who has over in the sector of the fisheries on the Coast is . 
, the last new , and I must by that I me in either almost exclusively to the bulletins of press of this morning , the leaders seem have reversed to the Antarctic of 30 days that they had contribute to respect . 
always of after the accountable people of press of the debate who has had place to the other place yesterday last , he seems that the Minister of the Fisheries , Mr. Dhaliwal , has been taken by surprise by this new , all as the government is was mouth admission , he there has four weeks , when the Court Supreme of the Canada has the his decision . 
far of me the idea , honourable senators , of me question in expert lawyer and still least in interprète of the judgment of the Court Supreme of the Canada , but the statement made by a of the leaders this morning , according which him and his colleagues the reserving the right of regulate their own activities of fishing , is , to my humble notice , contrary to the judgment the by the Court Supreme of the Canada . 
in the decision majority , the Justice Binnie fact of of : 
... the scope limited of the right obvious of the treaty . 
he wrote : : 
the right obvious of the treaty is a right réglementé who can , by regulation , be circonscrit to his line appropriate . 
of the line of taken , which he would reasonable of the expect to this that they allow to the families mi' kmaq of the ensure a living make according the standards of today today , can be determined by regulation and colleague without to they to the right obvious of the treaty . 
a such regulation satisfy this right and constitute not a they who should be valid following the standard established in the v. Badger . 
honourable senators , he me seems that these statements are a invitation lancée by the Court Supreme of the Canada to the government to that he move a regulation . 
when the Justice fact reference to the regulation , to the line of captures and to the tax of a regulation , he there has place of assume that he about of a regulation who would proposed by the government . 
he there has about two weeks , the Prime Minister would said that the government wisely of ask to the Court Supreme of surseoir to the judgment . 
more recently , the Minister of the Fisheries the in is taken to the members of the Opposition who unleashing the same something . 
I i that the government has examined and rejected the option of ask of surseoir to the judgment and that this option has been been . 
he me seems therefore that all this that he rest to do to the government , this is of present a legislation legislative or a regulation , or the two . 
in addition , the government should consider of refer the regulation in question directly to the Court Supreme for ensure to this that he be well consistent with the judgment the by this last . 
I doubt very that the aboriginal the provisional of least of that . 
not any what regulation who will tabled will treaties challenged and will to by the together of the process judicial . 
I believe prudent that the government veterinary a such regulation to the Court Supreme of the Canada . 
honourable senators , if I say that , this is simply because that the situation the worsening of day in day . 
without would be alarmist , I think that we not are that too aware of the incidents violent who the are products in the region and are to the that of the produce . 
a vacuum legal has been created . 
of other have resolved this vacuum created by the Court Supreme of the Canada and he me seems that care will be the chaos . 
the price of the case " Nobody " for 99 
the hon. Catherine S . Callbeck : 
honourable senators , I like out that we mark the Monday 18 October next the Day of the human . 
this is the 18 October 1929 that the Council private British has said that the women were of the " people " in right Canadian and that they could therefore be élues to the Senate . 
this decision has been made to the the of a long battle legal and policy seeing by Faries by , Nellie McClung , Dupuis McKinny , Irene Parlby and Henrietta Muir Edwards , five women Canadian better whom as the the " Famous Five " . 
since 1979 , in commémoration of the case " Nobody " , of the price of the Governor General are Achievement each year to the outset of the 18 October for honour of the women who have actively contributed to the promotion of the woman . 
I am proud of do know to the honourable senators that a woman of Tignish , in Island - Edward - Prince - Edward , Anne - Marie , , will among the five lauréates of this year . 
Anne - Marie is a human remarkable who continues of help actively to the well - be of his community , of his province and of the country . 
this is the second woman of the Island to receive this price prestigious .

I I now the insurance that , the week next , the committees meeting . 
I wish that , as today today , the committee of the transport and of the Communications who has been up yesterday welcomes to the election of the chairman and starts his business as the week next . 
he there has of the will court to respect on this very important question . 
I am not only call to the senators of the Quebec , but also to those of the East of the Canada . 
we properly very RCMP by the decision who will taken in this bill of Onex . 
that not one not only the Quebec , I not am not paroissial . 
I not I not the spirit of clocher . 
I hope only that the committee the will quickly to the task , of so that we can sit the week next to of power have someone something to say before that the Court Supreme not non a decision who risk of have a effect on the future of Air Canada . 
the he there has a something who should to to heart to the Liberal , this is well Air Canada . 
he was same surprised of have succeeded to do replace the behalf of the Airlines air Trans - Canada by the of Air Canada , a behalf who is by the the became famous in the world world . 
( the motion is agreed , and the report is adopted . ) 
Adopted of the second report 
the Senate what to the study of the second report of the Committee of selection ( membership of the committee of the Affairs foreign ) , presented to the Senate the 13 October 99 . - ( - hon. senator MLA ) . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I move the Adopted of this report . 
the the the Speaker : 
you pleasure - he , honourable senators , of adopt the motion ? 
the hon. Marcel homme man : 
I was new senator . 
watch a moment , that can do the subject of debates . 
I I therefore taken the speak before this auguste Dreadnought . 
, my great surprise , human not is party . 
this day - that , all the world has listened my interpretation of this clause of the Rules . 
I I said that the Committee of selection not should not forget that he there has of the senators who are came to the Senate in the hope of well serve their country , including in on to the committees . 
I rather " not aligné " . 
for the moment , I rather stay " not aligné " . 
the problem the worsening , because he there has now five senators who are in the same situation , which three are very these by the work of the committees . 
we not we not resolved the problem . 
we want show to the world how works a democracy . 
we want help to ensure the unity of the Canada . 
we want do understand this that the expression " Nations Nations " means . 
we want appreciation of the respect to the minorities religious and other . 
yet , we not managing same not to decide this that he must do of five senators eulogizing independent . 
this is a shame . 
. has had point to all they of stratagèmes , these six last years , for avoid of take a decision , but I me refrain of appoint the senators who have trempé in these machinations . 
I not pretend not that the senators not alignés have more of rights that the senators Lynch - Lynch , Kinsella and the other . 
I say by against that we in we as that the senators Carstairs , Graham and the other . 
we are all equal , and this is the opinion of the senator Atkins and particularly of the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
if the senators are all equal , they should power do part of committees . 
I not say not that he would their give their Prime choice . 
I am prepared to accept that . not me the would not . 
in private , well of the people me limited reason . 
I give now a notice , as the Rules the require . 
as Honour the the knows know , when I hear do someone something , I what to the actions . 
he there has about five years , I I reminded to the committee this who the was past . 
this year , I I given my speak to some people here , to the Senate , that I not recommencerais not , that I not me lèverais not and that I not would not of speech . 
I not say not that I I been failed , but almost . 
I not so not to believe that the only fact of say not can draw as of attention . 
I had given my speak that I not would not of speech this day - that , to thought understand that we poursuivrions the business yesterday . 
I trouvais that this was equitable and I I agreed . 
let this who the is past . 
the Committee of selection has chosen the members of two committees . 
my comments not improve human in particular , but I in I enough of the people who not play not frank - stake . 
some will losing any credibility . 
in the number of the Quorum who is The yesterday , he there has a clause sensationnel wrote by a woman that I know since of the years ; I want speak of a new senator , Ms Finnerty . 
in this clause , she said that she is very proud of have been appointed to the Senate because that she admire the work of the committees Senate and that the reports iterations and labourers who in are derogate . 
she quote , between other , the senators Croll and Keith . 
she said that the value of the Senate the find in his committees and in the continuity that he assure for better serve the Canada . 
you not hearing more this speech very often ; I starts to in have more that enough . 
if . me ask of go work for the government of the Quebec , I further . 
I I other something to do that of losing my time here . 
I am come here because that I think that the Canada is in danger . 
I am come because that I believe that we can show to the rest of the world that we can do a difference . 
I hates this hypocrisy who we fact say that our country is the better of the world , all in empêchant those who are loans to work of do in so that he the remains . 
I understand the Nations Nations . 
this not is not the Quebec who will resulting the apartheid of our country , as is that that so a day . 
we must be more attentifs to the needs of the Nations Nations . 
I am very friend with the Nisga' has , in British - British , and I rise their Defence to each time that we in about here . 
( 0950 ) 
honourable senators , that the is - he past here , Tuesday last ? 
a Committee of selection has been set . 
I I attended yesterday to the first meeting of this committee and I me did to this that the committee saying that he not knew too what do of the senators independent , this who not me concern not so for the moment . 
the members of the Committee of selection can have a some impact on the business that undertake a senator to the over of the two next years . 
he the is of a committee important , since , in principle , these nine senators resident to what committee meeting some senators . 
I me am therefore presented to the sitting of the committee of yesterday for see that a of the nine senators was absent . 
he had sent a replacement . 
honourable senators , I not nommerai human . 
you see therefore to what point I am kind , not is - this not ? 
the senators must do their own research for find who was in fault . 
when a human accept a work , she must the accomplish . 
the women who members to the Senate have poses that they remplissaient their duty many better that the majority of the men to the Senate . 
I me recall of the sittings that has held the under - committee of the former Veterans in February 1998 . Ni the Senate or the House of the Commons not sitting to this time - that . 
three senators Liberal have attended to the deliberations of the committee , all of the women . 
the leaders of the Senate not have could find a man for sit to this committee . 
I could you quote , word for word , this that the hon. senator Carstairs has answered to the question that I him I raised . 
I him I asked : " Quels were the criteria modern ? " 
she has said that she was the first to to the question of the representation of the women in a report that she had prepared on the associations parliamentarians in 1993 . - delegations to the time were ensured only of men . 
, this about , I remind that I I been replaced by the senator Finestone during few years . 
however , I forward still the opportunity of 650,000 my association hurling . 
honourable senators , I not know not how or when the House will a decision to the about of these two reports . 
each time that the senators are interviewés to the television or reported by a group of students , of journalists or other , that say - we ? 
this is true , and I there believe . 
however , that should the lower in the facts . 
I not believe not to the clauses . 
if a senator accept a position to the within of a committee , he or she should participate to all the meetings for . 
we not are not of the members are . said in the corridors : " Présentez - you to the committee today today and , after two years of studies , he there will a vote final in committee . " 
they not know same not this on what they the you , but they lèvent the with when their leaders lèvent the their . 
they not know absolutely not this who the is past . 
honourable senators , the words " continuity " and " dedication " are to the way in our speech . 
, the over of the two next weeks , start to reflect to the way which we will to the situation of the senators independent . 
if we not the do not , I créerai my own committee of parliamentarians who the interested to the Affairs international . 
human not can we in é . 
the the the Speaker : 
if no other hon. senator not wishes take the speak , you pleasure - he , honourable senators , of adopt the motion ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
( the motion is agreed , and the report is adopted . ) 
visitors of in 
the the the Speaker :

of the Senators :

that the committee be authorized to sit during the sittings and the congés of the Senate ; 
that the committee be authorized to allow the Electronic Ministerial of his deliberations public ; and 
that the committee , the report final to the more later 18 November 99 . 
the hon. Marcel homme man : 
honourable senators , this committee has played a role very important . 
we know all the jurisdiction and the patience tremendous of the chairman , the senator Stewart . 
I am sorry of learn that the - this we leaving in November . 
I wish to this that a other man charming that I know very well and that I I seconded to as of Secretary of the Party Liberal during the years 70 not the méprenne not on my comments . 
he the is of the senator Lewis . 
when I I spoke of continuity to the within of a committee and of members who the stockpiles in the mêlée to the last minute , I not thought not to the senator Lewis . 
we know all that the senator Whelan we has barely this been in reason of his retirement and that he has was the replace . 
the senator Lewis , which we know all the intellect , the spirit efficient and the jurisdiction to as of distinguished lawyer , has been chosen for complete the work . 
is why , now that I I performance my was , I wish to rectify all this that I I could do of rodents . 
I not thought not to the hon. senator Lewis when I I spoke of continuity and of the Alternative of the members of committees . 
course , he was replace the senator Whelan , and this is the senator Lewis who has been chosen . 
all the other members of the committee remain in service , and I me in am criticized . 
if I had fact part of the committee , I would hoped that the senator Stewart be elected to the Speaker , to that he can complete the work , with the senator Andreychuk to the chairman - Speaker . 
is why I I agreed Tuesday of not not take the speak . 
we we invested of the hundreds of thousands of $ in this committee to that he which this study in our behalf - and I wish to this that all the honourable senators the know . 
he me seems perfectly natural that the members who have worked to this study be those who remission the work . 
I not know not how you made the things in English . 
when I finish to the school , I was good in some Contents , and bad in of other . 
. me said that I excellais in philosophical , including in logical . 
the senator Taylor not should not songs as , because I I fact campaign for him also , during the worse year of his career in Alberta . 
I can dévoiler here the behalf of all those who have provided their assistance . 
the senator Taylor : 
that destroyed the argument according which you are a be logical . 
the senator homme man : 
I thought you convertir to my logical . 
I me am many of the training of this committee . 
course , I assisterai the more possible to his sittings , to as volunteer . 
honourable senators , I not I not the power or the gloatingly of give of the advice to the committee , but I hope that this last will all the time necessary , because this is a work difficult . 
I hope that we not will not to ask , to the community of November , a other extension under a other chairman , who will beginnings to zero . 
I hope that the committee will all the time necessary for complete the work to that this be that the couronnement of the long years of service of the senator Stewart to the Senate . 
for facilitate the work of the committee , I will me buttress now to that the committee can the meet today today . 
I could speak of all the sections enrolled to the Paper this morning . 
we not should never to a sitting to 9 p.m. because that I am almost to my better earlier the morning , and I am in fact to my better very later the last . 
I wish good opportunity to the senator Stewart in the work in our behalf and I hope that the committee will the time of complete the work and of present to the Senate a report signed by the senator . 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
I believe that he is only logical that this ) be réinséré in the mandate . 
the committee has the of the hearings to the over made he has heard various officials of the government , he has met of the officers senior of the forces Armed , which some were in Bosnia , various experts of the keeping of the peace , of the historians , the ambassador of the Canada to the NATO and many of his colleagues , as civilians that military . 
he has met the Secretary General of the NATO who has left the position recently and of other senior officials . 
he has fact many of research and coast many of information , which the major part will to the preparation of the report final . 
the witnesses key who are , this is - to - say who not are not précisés in the mandate , are the Minister of the Affairs foreign , the Minister of the Defence national and the Leader of of - Staff of the Defence , who are the witnesses that he would the more logical of hear before of to end to the hearings . 
I move therefore a amendment who , I the hope , receive the support of the Senate . 
he suivrait the ) 2 of the motion which we are before . 
motion of amendment 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
by therefore , I move , seconded by the senator Kinsella : 
that the committee witness , between other witnesses , the Minister of the Affairs foreign , the Minister of the Defence national and the Leader of of - Staff of the Defence . 
the hon. Fernand Robichaud ( His the the chairman Acting ) : 
pleasure - he to the honourable senators of adopt the motion of amendment ? 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the motion such that she was during of the session before was enough aggressive , with the names of the ministers and of the other officials that the committee wanted hear . 
these names not are not précisés in the motion current in part to because of the deadline given to the committee for do report and of the Availability of the ministers and of the other people appointments in the motion original . 
I écouterai carefully the arguments of the senator Stewart , but I believe that this are that the major reasons for which the motion is as she is . 
well course , that not means not that the committee not can not may these people and of other witnesses the he the wishes . 
I not know too why the committee not has not already heard these people , if this not is that his business have been aborted by the prorogation . 
I know what are the intentions of the committee . 
I hope , as the has said the senator homme man , that the committee chief the senator Stewart as chairman . 
I I found that the committee had the intention of planned his business as today today . 
he the could very well that all the people Lisa in the motion original be convoquées and heard . 
he the could also , for of the reasons proposing of the will of the committee or of the Senate , that these people not be not available . 
of after this that I understand of the Rules of the Senate , we have a problem if these people not had not been heard the 18 November , be to the date determined for the Presented of the report . 
this is for that that the motion has been worded as she the is . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , in as that sponsor of the motion key , I find that the amendment proposed améliorerait this motion . 
I there see a motion friendly . 
she not limit not the number of people that the committee can hear , but she urge the - this to hear , between other , the Minister of the Affairs foreign , the Minister of the Defence national and the Leader of of - Staff of the Defence . 
given given the work unfortunately by the committee during of the last session and the the of the quality of the work , I would very surprised that he not Justice not necessary of hear the three people mentioned for power complete his business . 
I forward me also with forward of hear the senator Stewart . 
the hon. John B . Stewart : 
honourable senators , . there that the decision that will the committee to the about of his Speaker when he the meeting not will can - be not valid . 
however , forget that for the time . 
I agree with the senator Lynch - Lynch that the committee has work a work extremely fouillé and asset . 
the work who has been work to the over of the last sitting fact certainly an the need of hear the Minister of the Affairs foreign . 
he fact an , though least impérativement , the need of hear the Minister of the Defence national . 
the same something worth for the Leader of of - Staff of the Defence . 
other said , I am fully of agreed with the substance of the motion of amendment of the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
is a other reason for which the committee should hear these three people . 
the speech of the Throne , who has been read more earlier this week , makes almost the committee to hear the ministers . 
the government treated a importance increased to the security human in his policy foreign and he oeuvrera for that the representations global if of the progress enemies in the framework of a approach international for the security human . 
we we already heard that of the share of the present Minister of the Affairs foreign , but now , this is the Gouverneure general who the said to the behalf of the government . 
he is obvious that the committee will entendreM. Axworthy when he in what to this step of the work . 
a other ) of the speech of the Throne draw our attention , and I quote to new : 
the government continue also of ensure to this that the Forces Canadian be in legislation of support the role of the Canada for help to the security in the world and he the efforcera of increase the ability of the Canadians and of the Canadians of help to ensure the peace and the security in of the country foreign . 
he me seems that the human that the committee must hear that - that is the Minister of the Defence national , the human requested of the Department . 
I not see not how the committee can do report without have heard these witnesses - the two ministers to all the least . 
however , I not can not speak to the behalf of the committee . 
I in just now to the point raised by the senator Hays . 
what that he in be , the date of the 18 November found in the motion . 
the problem which the leadership of the government to the Senate is such , this is that the Senate could very well the find in a situation impossible - of a share , a deadline tie and , of other share , the insistance that three representatives in particular be heard . 
if this is the case , the deadline should be considered as flexible . 
if , we will a biggest problem . 
honourable senators , I think that the committee would hear to the least two ministers , and probably the human to which . has fact reference . 
, my notice , that not fact no doubt . 
the problem which we are face is , of a some way , a problem of form , to know : can - we the do in the time available ? 
if this clause is her , he is very possible that the committee will ask a extension beyond - beyond of the 18 November . 
is the situation such that I the understand . 
the hon. Nicholas W . Taylor : 
honourable senators , I like take a time for express my support to the motion of amendment proposed by the other side . 
ask to the committee of write a report without have heard the Minister of the Affairs foreign , the Minister of the Defence national and the Leader of of - Staff - the senator Stewart , who is a old Scotians , will of agreed with me - would a little as eat of the gruau without sel . 
me the opposed more earlier this year to the intervention to the Kosovo , I believe that he is important that we understand the reaching who under - parliament our role in the Affairs foreign and the reaching who must be the ours in the future . 
honourable senators , I I recently given a speech to the behalf of the hon. David Kilgour , Secretary of state ( America Latin and Africa ) , before a class of graduates in Science political , to Calgary . 
Mr. . Kilgour me had given the leave of express my own thoughts . 
I I taken the freedom of speak in the sense of the comments held by the senator Stewart , to know that the future will conditionné many more by the security personal or human that by the security national . 
the most of the war who are victimized to the over of the 20 last years have been of the war civilian and not of the conflict between States . 
this is almost as a ascertain in board , in this sense that we we buying to do participate our soldiers . 
in the case of the Kosovo , what kind of logical could justify the commitment of our forces Armed for daylights of the women and of the children innocent , of the only fact that a country has elected the bad human for lead the government ? 
I know that I take of the opportunity for reopen the matter of the Kosovo , and I not me in apologize not . 
however , same if I not am not member of the committee of the Affairs foreign , I the attend to few sittings and question of the questions to the various witnesses . 
in the case of a about also important that the Appointment of our military for do of the missions of police without the approval of the Parliament , why that not should - he not do the subject of a review thorough ? 
the date limit of the 18 November is completely artificielle . 
I support of all heart the motion of amendment . 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I believe that the motion of amendment would the committee , because she témoignerait of the will of the Senate of encourage the ministers to the present before the committee . 
I understand perfectly that he can be difficult for a chairman of ask to the ministers of come testify , in reason of their employment of the time responsible , but if that found in the mandate of the committee , that conferred more of authority to the chairman . 
if , for a reason impérative , a Minister or the Leader of of - Staff not could appear before the committee , as we we the intention of the invite to the do , he will to the committee of decide this that he agree of do to this time - that . 
will he to ask a extension of our mandate or properly - we libérés of this condition for the Tabled of our report ? 
I believe that this is and that he must deal the problem . 
he the find that the words in which the mandate is wording me one , because they clauses more of authority to the chairman . 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , after have listened the debate , we , of this side - this , tabling the amendment allowing to the committee of hear these other witnesses . 
as to the date of Tabled of the report , in as that chairman of committee , I not I never had of difficulty to to ask to the Senate a extension of the time frame for deal of a question which the committee had been before , and I am am that he in will and for the committee of the Affairs foreign the he has need of a extension . 
the hon. Marcel homme man : 
honourable senators , we we ourselves in the same situation that in 1984 , when the government has wanted create a Institute for the peace and the security . 
all the world said that this was completely impossible . 
many were against the creation of a such institute because that , twice - they , this was a gift of departure for the Prime Minister Trudeau . 
I not was not of agreed . 
, the time , I was chairman of the committee of the Defence national and of the Affairs External to the House of the Commons and we had 30 members to organizing . 
we we worked against the shows . 
by that , I hear that if we feel that our task is important , we asking to the members of the committee of work more often . 
he not there has nothing of better for ensure the continuity that of sit five days by week . 
if the committee not seat that of time to other , we know of experience that he not will not the time of do all this that he must do , there including write the report . 
the gloatingly not is not the a of my explicit , and I me garderais well of do the lesson . 
under the Speaker of the hon. senator Stewart , and in concentrant the services , the committee could sit during the day and do produce and lower all the various documents the last . 
with of the will , I am course that he will this that the senator Lynch - Lynch has asked and this that the senator Stewart would accomplish . 
however , the he not seat that two or three days , even two after - afternoon by week , this is impossible . 
nothing not we from of begin a Monday , in after - afternoon or in evening . 
I like really that . respect the deadline to that the report the the behalf of the senator Stewart . 
if we not managing not to respect the deadline , we able always ask that . the repousse . 
if we want have someone something of north between the hands , he would good , in the legislation of the possible , of do may the report to the date the . 
this not is that in all last point that the . should consider to ask a extension of the deadline . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
honourable senators , I ask the leave of take of new the speak to this about . 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
the leave is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
I thank also the senator Hays of give the support of the party to this motion of amendment . 
he off , I believe , that the ministers and the Leader of of - Staff of the Defence the réjouiront of power appear before the committee . 
he the is that of a effort martyrdom of party taken , who is to help the Canadians to understand the new NATO , the place of the Canada in this organization , and to see if we begin of the resources The for answer to the obligations taken in under of the new NATO , who has shifted many more quickly and in a sense very different by report to this that think the most of between we . 
the Kosovo not has been that a example of that . 
of other examples will can - be , and they now of be still worse . 
the Canada must know what place he ' in the new NATO . 
I I good hope that the ministers and the Leader of of - Staff of the Defence accueilleront Right the opportunity of we present the point of view of the government , this who can the opportunity useful for the preparation of the report that many of people , to the Canada and , , waiting impatiemment . 
the discussions that I I face to this comments to the abroad me the affirm .

Greg is unborn and has up to Maple Ridge , in British - British , and he was a of the best Pilots of the series CART or of the stretch no Indy . 
in 1997 , to the age of 22 years , he has been the more young pilot to win a , in series CART . 
unfortunately , well of other prospects the overemphasized to him . 
Greg practice more that his runner on the blistering in giving many to his community . 
he Moon to of many observe of more and he was a such advocate of various causes . 
the enthusiasm in the Assistance was real . 
a funds to the behalf continue of come in assistance to the his that he posing . 
honourable senators , the Canadians not are not loans of forget Greg Moore . 
the Late of Mwalimu Julius K . Nyerere , Ancien chairman of the Republic Unie of Tanzanie 
tribute 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , in 1966 , . me had offered the position of chairman - dean of the school of right of Dar role - Salaam , in Tanzanie . 
I had refused the offer , préférant stay to the Canada where I am became associated to the within of the more great s of lawyers of the region Atlantic . 
if I had agreed the position in Tanzanie , I would been the witness draft of the miracle democratic orchestré by Julius Nyerere , who has led the country to the independence in the affranchissant of the England in 1961 , and who was the Prime chairman of the Tanzanie , of 1962 to 1985 . 
Mr. . Nyerere was liked and vénéré across in the world for the integrity , his modestly and the intellect . 
he was considered as the a of the more great men of state of the Africa , to the same as that Nelson Mandela , and he the among the more important leaders of the 20 century . 
Mr. . Julius Nyerere had a training of enseignant . 
he is came in policy in vertical and he fonda the TANU , be the union national African of the Tanganyika . 
he is became Minister in Leader when the TANU remporta the election of 1960 . 
Mr. . Nyerere became Prime Minister when the Tanganyika accéda to the independence , in 1961 , but he démissionna as 1962 for the focus on the restructuring of the TANU and on the role that he would play by the the . 
he became chairman of a république after the election of 1962 . 
given given Mr. Nyerere someone the bombing of the States African , the Tanzanie servit of found to the members of the Congress national of Africa and to of many other groups dirigés by of the rebel of the Zimbabwe , of the Mozambique , of the Angola and of the Uganda . 
Nyerere was a very advocate of the culture African local , and his too the more miraculeuse was of give to the Tanzanie the union ethnic . 
, the opportunity of a tribute to Nyerere in the framework of the put " As It Happens " , Stephen Lewis , who has served with the Nations Nations in Africa and who was a friend of the former chairman , the is said émerveillé of the way which Nyerere has taken a country divided according the affiliation unfashionable and has fact of all of the " Tanzaniens " . 
he there is came in by of solid systems of education and of health and in imposing a language common . 
he was mortally by the consequences of the Division ethnic : the massacres and the destruction of a people and of a country . 
when Nyerere spoke of the Rwanda and practice of the assistance to his people , he parliamentary " many of emotion , of pain and of understanding " . 
not frustrated been of his vision and of the leadership , the Tanzanie would could know of the tersely similar . 
the 20 October , of the hundreds of thousands of Tanzaniens have began to affluer to the enter in the streets of the capital Dar role - Salaam to of to a last tribute to a man that the . was across in Tanzanie the " enseignant . " 
of the throngs great , but however harshness , bordaient the road Work of the airport to the residence Mr. Nyerere stretch in the banlieue and gémissaient to the a of the cercueil . 
Julius Nyerere has had right to of the funeral of state in Tanzanie the Thursday 21 October . 
this was a man to the vision and to the principles outstanding who will to of many people . 
honourable senators , Mary Lou Findley has well summary the situation to the end of the tribute the by the radio English of CBC - Canada in saying that if Nyerere had of a small country , this not was certainly not a small colourful . 
I support the last note of Stephen Lewis , who has said that Julius Nyerere was " a man all to fact pleasant " . 
the months of the history of the women 
the hon. Lucie pin : 
honourable senators , October is the Month of the history of the women . 
this is a excellent opportunity of saluting the progress made and of consider the obstacles that he we rest to overcome . 
we are very thank to the " Famous Five " who have led a long and duration fight in view of to our presence to the House possible . 
he there has now 70 years that we we learning the right of be addressed as of the people . 
well that I not me touch not to this that the . quite that we were before that we devenions of the people , I know however that be a human not has not still the same negative that be a man . 
the number of women revitalizing in this House and in the other place is for me a source of recognition and of your . 
their determination , their will , their intellect and their spirit constitute of the apports immense for our country . 
yet , how forget that we are still if little ? 
in this House , our colleagues masculins continue of we overtake in number , to reason of two for a . 
all in we earners of the fact that the Senate of the Canada be the fifth of the world for this who is of the representation " , we not can certainly not we settle of the of present of the things . 
he rest of many obstacles to the participation of the women in of if many facets of our life economic and policy . 
I I talked of many time , in this House and , , the difficulties which the women are confrontées when they the stockpiles in policy . 
yet , without a representation get of the women and of the other groups in our institutions political , how can - we we targuer of democracy ? 
therefore , to the time where we celebrate this success essential that has been the case " human " and all this that she has " for of the generations of Canadians , sachons that we not we not still reached the purpose . 
if the five celebrities militantes were with we , they continueraient of the fight for the equality . 
because that , today today still , we do of the differences between the people : between the men and the women , between the off and the poor , between the young and the old , between the majority and the minorities . 
and the figures regarding the members of this House and those of the other place continue of lower these distinctions , until to the day where we tabling the fact that a human is a human and nothing of other , or more or least . 
the policy of the tax on the income being to the owners of lots private 
the hon. Erminie J . Cohen : 
honourable senators , I like draw your attention on the concerns of the owners Canadian of lots private to the regard of the policy of the tax on the income and on the need , in their interest , of to in the best will the changes appropriate to the bill . 
in my province , the New - Brunswick , a family on six is he of a Editor boisé . 
about 425 $ lots private to the Canada are to of the families . 
in many of provinces , this is of these lots that from a part important of the Contents first necessary for do to the sawmills and the plants of pâte to paper . 
the most of the owners of these lots respect their land which they taking be not only because that she contributes to embellir the loss and to serve of habitat to the cash poses , but also because that she provides of the lumber to the industry and assure of the jobs in the small communities rural . 
take be of these lots private is a work monumental . 
do own a tree to from of a plant the enormous of time , to the least 40 years in the most of the regions of this country . 
the a of the ways which the government federal can encourage the promotion and the strengthening of the activities of be which is of apply a good policy of tax on the income . 
when the Canadians spend of the money for increase a new case , they can the first years déduire the losses of their other sources of income in the legislation where they can proof to Revenue Canada that they the waiting to of the " profits reasonable " of their new business . 
the owners of lots private , them , not can not the do . 
when a and agricultural what of a generation to a other , the tax on the be in capital is order as that the family which the firm . 
when a Editor boisé what of a he to a other the other , the tax to pay is often enormous . 
if the new he not has not of income for pay the tax in question , he can be forced of from the money necessary of the Editor , this who well often means that he must cut the trees . 
( 1420 ) 
why aside to the owners of lots private a treatment different of the which have right the other Canadians ? - something the ask , me seems he , by the fact that the wording of the Act of the tax on the income is such that a business who put until to 40 years for wasn of the profits waved simply between the mailles of the depend . 
of by the wording present , the Act of the tax on the income not can not to the of the realities of the practices of the management forest and of the will necessary for that a and can wasn of the profits . 
the associations of owners of lots private examining the question since 1988 . 
they forward that the resistance to the change to which they have been face during of the first years has fact place , to the Department of the Finance and to the Department of the Revenue national , to a understanding reasonable of the problem . 
the question has been had working by different committees of the House of the Commons , by the NRTEE NRTEE national on the Environment and the economy and , recently , by our own under - committee responsible of study the forest boréale . 
honourable senators , he we must obtain the cooperation of the owners of lots private if we want respect the commitments that we we taken in the Protocol of Kyoto and in the bill announced of legislation on the cash in calling to the Canada , and their give a policy tax based , who the encourage to reboiser their land and to accelerate of efforts for well manage their Lands . 
he is great time that we confront this problem . 
I ask urge to the Minister of the Finance of lead to well this bill . 
the Late of Claude Masson 
tribute 
the hon. Fernand Roberge : 
Claude was a man simple , well in his peau , always of good on and respected by his our . 
he was also a man of faith , committed socially , a professional , short , a man copy . 
the departure is a great loss for - Presse and the community journalistic Quebec , and that for the society in General . 
we are our sympathy to his family and to the families of the other hearted in this terrible accident . 
the Defence national 
the recognition of the missions of keeping of the peace to the abroad 
the hon. Douglas Roche : 
honourable senators , I I found strange that , during of his first visit official to the Canada , Lord George Robertson , the new Secretary General of the NATO , criticism the Estimates military of the Canada then that he ignorait apparently that the troops Canadian who used the interests of the peace in the world are now more many that they not the have been since the War of Korea . 
the forces Canadian of keeping of the peace rely among the more prééminentes and the more effective to the world . 
in this months of November , advancement - in for to tribute in particular to the 108 Canadians who have lost the life in screening the security and the peace international to the over of the 40 last years . 
their contribution to the soulagement of the suffering human is invaluable . 
the Canadians know that the keeping of the peace is a over there of our country . 
we must well understand that our forces Armed play a role important in the promotion of our interests to the abroad , what that be the way which we the définissons . 
working in of the conditions astreignantes dépassant all this that . can the imagine and which of their family during of very long periods , the members of the forces Canadian of keeping of the peace are been in view of change really the things and of ensure to the promotion and to the keeping of a real security . 
of the Canadians the are sought and are dead for defend the security and the freedom . 
our efforts continuels in view of ensure the security in the world constitute a tribute to their sacrifice and affirm this highest tradition . 
our forces of keeping of the peace not deserve not least . 
honourable senators , for this who is of the funds spent to the Reconstruction in the Balkans , where the War not has left that Eighteenth , and in of other regions of the world , who must the back of the consequences of the War , the Canada not has to receive of lessons of people . 
in the operations of combat , this not is not that the Canada expenditure too little , this is that the other country , there including the major country of the NATO , spend too . 
the languages official 
postponement of the date of the Tabled of the report annual of the Commissioner 
the hon. Jean - Robert Gauthier : 
honourable senators , the 4 October last , the Commissioner to the languages official presiding , in a letter reply to our chairman , the intention of until the Tabled of the report annual , of manner to cover now the period correspondent to the year tax rather that to the year civil . 
the Act on the languages official not is not clear on the guideline of the Tabled of this report annual . 
however , the clause 37 of the Act of interpretation unless that the concept of year the over on any period of 12 months . 
this decision away the communities linguistic minority and the committee Joint Standing of the House of the Commons and of the Senate of the languages official of a report and of a tool very asset and very important . 
the crime of ' of people human 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , across in the world , of the people the are those , contraindre , " and sell in the framework of this that . Order populairement the " with World of the esclaves " . 
the victims are usually of the women , of the daughters and of the boys who are forced of live in of the situations of and sexual and economic to the profit of recruteurs , of trafiquants and of organizations criminal . 
in 1997 , the UN averted valued million the number of the people who were victims of a situation ' to the the World , which the benefit net could achieve 7 billion of $ by year . 
the Canada not is not to the homeless of such activities . 
the fall last , . has discovered to Toronto a system of prostitution , between other , set of women Asian . 
the ' of people human , of same that the many activities which the Adieu this kind of crime , as the prostitution , the séquestration and the sexual , are all of the activities illégales to the Canada . 
despite the conventions international prevented the with of the esclaves human , this kind of activity criminal is in increase . 
that the ask in part because that he is relatively easy of do the ' of people human . 
often , the people by the subject of ' not the their not the that they are in danger and traversent volunteers the border for enter in a other country . 
he is least likely that the members of the peace do of the arrests in the case of ' of people human that in the case of smuggling of drug and of weapons to fire . 
he is tragic of see that the great case that the . fact of the young assure a ask Increase for do of new recruits home the women more young and the children . 
the ' of people human , a risk for the security , because the profits made through to the and of people human used often to fund the organizations criminal . 
in Asia , in the region of the Mékong , the ' of the people human rivalise now of interest with the ' of drug to the " of the crime organized . 
of same , in of other regions instables , as in the former Union Soviet , the women and the children are particularly vulnerable to this regard . 
the Canada must work to prevent some organizations of the serve of the Canada as of a place of Clinic of funds for the funding of activities criminal . 
in 1949 , the Assembly general of the Nations Nations approuvait the Convention for the repression and the abolition of the with of the people human and of the and of the prostitution of them . 
the Canada not has always not ratified this convention in despite of the fact that she be into in into in 1949 .

our Prime Minister and the government have fact know that according the statistics the situation not would not if bad and that he not is therefore not necessary that the government would a assistance Supplementary to the farmers . 
however , these statistics not have not been communiquées to those who are came ask of the assistance . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate could - he user of his good boards for the ensure that the Minister of the Agriculture make public the statistics in because for that we can the examine ? 
when I I examined the statistics to on the Saskatchewan , they me have me very clear and I am sure that of other will of agreed with me to this about . 
as all the know well , the costs of production are two time more high that the price of sales . 
the Minister can - he we say if we able a day see these data boxing on which the Prime Minister the support ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Agriculture have met the first ministers of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba and that the delegations who the accompagnaient . 
he seemed there have a some confusion as to the figures on which the two parties the appuyaient . 
we me of rationaliser these data and I not can that assume that the data rationalisées will complete public soon . 
however , I not like not let believe that , because that he there had difference of opinions relatively to some figures in because , the government not instead not of other measures . 
this would that a conclusion many too hâtive . 
the senator Spivak : 
honourable senators , the Prime Minister of my province is oversees amèrement Whip . 
I know that a committee the before on the figures . 
however , the assistance demandée by the Manitoba and the Saskatchewan was , as the Minister the knows perfectly , of 1.3 billion of $ . 
I I déduit of the about that I I face with the people who are attack see the Prime Minister , and that of the or published in the press and of the documents published to the the of a identifies in the National Financial , which we know that he not the wrong never , that the government not wisely not of give a assistance of this importance , that to the notice , she not was not necessary for deal the crisis . 
in fact , the response is a not without answer . 
the Minister has he someone something to we say today today who indiquerait that this not is not that the attitude of the government ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the government has an someone 900 million of $ to the program ACRA . 
the provinces have fact a contribution of higher million of $ . 
in more of this amount , the delegation has asked a assistance Supplementary of 1.3 billion of $ . 
I think that all the world is of agreed that - that . 
the response of the government has been that he not quite not that the . could consider a assistance of 1.3 billion of $ . 
I not think not that he that changed of notice . 
however , he would compassionate of conclude that no assistance not is available . 
the crisis agricultural to the Manitoba and in Saskatchewan - - very made to the Prime Minister 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , I know perfectly of what about the Minister . 
I you greetings their point of view . 
, the like of other senators , I me am personally entretenue with several delegations . 
they the have know . 
however , until to present , nothing not we allows of believe that this will fact . 
the Minister signalera he to the Prime Minister and to the s that the moral is to the more there , to the Manitoba ? 
the people of the province the believe marginaux and little stick of the attention granted to all the other regions of the country . 
I not am not of their notice . 
the Minister will he also share of the sentiment who starts to poindre to the Manitoba ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I guaranteed personally to the hon. senator that his remarks will ensued to the Prime Minister to the first opportunity . 
well that . that Allocation to the ACRA a amount of money important , be someone 1.5 billion of $ , and well that 36 $ requests have been showed in the framework of this program , he there has had of the complaints as to the fact that this money not has not been débloqué as he the would should for answer effectively to the needs . 
of the concerns have also been expressed as to the fact that the amount Allocation to this program could not not be sufficient . 
all these remarks are taken to the seriously . 
the government the examine with attention . 
the crisis agricultural to the Manitoba and in Saskatchewan - - effectiveness of the program of assistance in case of disaster linked to the income agricultural 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the government to the Senate has indicated that the ACRA works well . 
the message that we envoient the farmers of the Western Canadian is that he the can that he works well , , but that he not is not for deal the problems that are the Saskatchewan and the Manitoba . 
this message has been sent to the Prime Minister federal by the a of the two first ministers provincial to the least . 
why the ask of remanier the ACRA introduced by the Manitoba and the Saskatchewan not has she not been received Right ? 
why has . fact hope to the first ministers of these provinces that he there would of the new ? 
why have - they been attirés to Ottawa for the do say a time of more that the government would study the case ? 
after of the months of tergiversations , is - this that a way of do traîner the things for that he not rest more a only family of farmers ? 
is - this that the plan secret of the government ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , for the stewardship of the hon. senator , I not I not said that the ACRA operated Allison well and not had not need of improvements . 
this that I I said , this is that this was a program important Array billion of $ . 
someone 36 $ farmers there have idea in soumettant a ask . 
, the least , they there have thought to a time given . 
I think that all the world recognizes that the money dispensé by the through of this program not has not been circulated also effectively that he would could the be . 
the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Agriculture taking the question to the seriously . 
the talks that they have any with the first ministers provincial have confirmed this that they knew already . 
I hope that of the improvements will be made to the programs existing and that . can find of other forms of assistance . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I I received of the calls of farmers who have fact a ask in the framework of ACRA . 
they me have said that that could take until to six months for have a response . 
how the government can - he know if the program works well if the response that the farmers waiting desperately so six months in behind ? 
some of those who have fact a ask in April or in May not receive that today today notification that they not are not eligible . 
of where just the confidence that the government has in the ACRA ? 
after consultation , the first ministers of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba are came to Ottawa convinced that their problem would taken to the seriously , to the place of do the subject of studies additional . 
they the formerly to this that the hailed who are to the on of the bankrupt be sauvées . 
a time that the farmers will parties , they not reviendront not . 
this not is not a resources registration . 
when they who the firm é , they who the Saskatchewan . It destroyed the basic . 
we not dishonour not of the same diversity that some other provinces , there including the of the Leader of the government . 
we dépendons of the agriculture , of the least for the time . 
when chair . the program ACRA of the point of view of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba , rather that of a point of view world ? 
he not there has more of time to losing . 
of other studies not are more necessary . 
. can certainly establish here a 60 with the fishing , this that the Minister should understand . 
. not can more expect . 
the problem is criticism . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , her the senator will pleased if I then the ensure that a such review has place in this time . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
we not we not need of review . 
the senator Boudreau : 
according her the senator , and she not is probably not the only to have this opinion , the program not has not fonctionné also well that he the could . 
the senator has spoke of delay in the treatment of the requests . 
the government has taken this question to the seriously . 
hope that the results of this seriously review will people public very soon . 
the crisis agricultural to the Manitoba and in Saskatchewan - - visit of a delegation to Ottawa - - anomalies in the statistics 
the hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
we about of well of the things which we not are not many to the aware . 
however , a something that we know , this is that the farmers of the west of the Canada rely among the farmers the more productive , the more effective and the more commensurate to the world . 
they grow of the products of the more high quality . 
yet , without that they there be for someone something , they are bankrupt . 
that , we the know . 
they are acculés to the bankrupt and some the suicident . 
the senators Sparrow , Gustafson , Spivak and Andreychuk speak of this problem since the fall 1998 . We in we spoke also in February , all as we the we fact in March , in April and in June . 
the first ministers of these two provinces are then came to visit to the government . 
what months are - we ? 
they have received of the figures of the Prime Minister and of the Minister of the Agriculture . 
when they have asked of where were these figures , . their has said that they not could not the say . 
I am a guys simple of the Prairies . 
, my notice , the Minister must we say when these figures will people public and how this situation has could the produce . 
of where were these figures ? 
of the apologize should be made to the two first ministers who have been treated of the so . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , he there has clearly a difference of views in this who respect the figures are the are fiés the two first ministers provincial and the Prime Minister . 
I not believe not that this problem that been resolved until to now . 
all the efforts voulus will loans in view of help these figures and of to public the way that a agreed has been concluded . 
this is a very broader problem , as the knows the hon. senator . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , the first ministers have said that all their figures performance to the data of Statistics Canada and of the Department federal of the Agriculture and that to the data that the government federal has communiquées to the great public . 
when the . has asked to the government federal of explain the figures to the first ministers , they not have not been in legislation of the do . 
he not enough not of say that he there has had a difference of views . 
goes not has not been the case . 
the first ministers provincial have statement a problem . 
they have used the statistics and the figures that their has provided the government of the Canada . 
the government of the Canada has then said : " We we of other figures , but we not you examine not of where they come . " 
this was a great not for him . 
I think that the government of the Canada should present of the apologize to the two first ministers and the dépêcher of we say when he soon these figures and their source to the House of the Commons and to the Senate . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I bring the point of view of the senator to the Minister of the Agriculture and to the Prime Minister . 
more specifically , I believe that the Minister of the Agriculture provide a explanation . 
of after the discussions that I I face with him , I me forward to this that he the the directly . 
the crisis agricultural to the Manitoba and in Saskatchewan - - impact economic of the further of the income agricultural 
the hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the House .

the forecasts for the Manitoba the chiffraient to least per million of $ , the level the more low never reached to the over of the century , still more low that in the years 30 . 
the frustration of the farmers and of the two first ministers provincial is enormous . 
I am a farmer and I opposite among them . 
we not can not we in out . 
he must do someone something . 
the situation will of serious impact national for the together of the Canada . 
we are a industry very culmination . 
he not there has not of producers more effective to the world that the producers of grain of the west of the Canada . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate , the members of the cabinet and the Prime Minister not the their - they not the that that will of serious impact national , not only in words of tentations of separation or of union to the States - United , but in words economic for the Canada ? 
the substantially agricultural through by our farmers help for a good share to our gained commercial . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I then ensure the hon. senator that the Prime Minister includes the importance of the sector agricultural for the together of the economy Canadian . 
, only two weeks before my into in service in this chamber respected , I I had the opportunity of go with the Bank of the Canada in Saskatchewan for there meet of the farmers and hear their very . 
I there I also fact a visit in a and agricultural and I admire do the activities , the effectiveness and the productivity of the farmers of the Prairies .

he must that the farmers be on a at of equality with their competitors across in the world and we must we strive for that they have of the opportunity playing . 
they have poses in the past , and they the will in the future , that the they have of the opportunity playing , they can very well succeed . 
I attention very clear to the hon. senator that the Prime Minister , the Minister of the Agriculture and me - same are aware of the importance of the sector agricultural of the Western for the country all world .

the government could the do , since the farmers discussed their bills the they have the money .

nine municipalities have decided to the way of a vote of not not pay their taxes . 
I I spoke to the préfet of the pay of Wellington . 
according him , this not is not that the farmers say of duties their taxes , but well that they are unable of the do . 
they not can be of the money that they not have not . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate would - he of i to the cabinet and to the Prime Minister the suggestion that they have taken to the seriously for deal of a way or of a other the problem of the debt to the Corporation of credit agricultural ?

ATTESTÉ : 
the business of the Senate 
the statement of the Speaker on the granting of a leave to the over of the Affairs offered and on the event of the 14 October 99 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , are - you of agreed for that I the now the statement that the senator Lynch - Lynch me has asked of do to the about of the Affairs offered during of the last sitting ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the the the Speaker : 
the 14 October , during the Affairs offered , the senator Hays has asked the leave of present , to the step of the notice of motions of the government , a motion in view of extend the adjournment of the Senate . 
the leave him has been granted , but as that the question has been implementation in discussion , he there has had a some confusion as to the procedure to follow . 
, the end , the motion increasing the adjournment of two weeks has been agreed and the Senate is past to other something . 
however , when the order of the day has been called , the senator Lynch - Lynch has asked to the Speaker of clarify the question to of avoid any confusion to the future . 
I thank many the senator Lynch - Lynch of have raised the question , I believe that this is important . 
the to this ask , I I well thought to the question and I am now prepared to me deal on my interpretation of the application of the rules and biodegradable of the Senate . 
in my statement , I me am tried of examine the more of case possible , but I not am not course of have covered all the 870 . 
in addition , this review will for of and some gaps and incohérences in the Rules , on which the committee Standing of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure should the look . 
the formula current of the Affairs offered fact part of the procedure of the Senate since 1991 . 
this year - that , the Rules of the Senate has been amended for draw the order in which the questions of the Affairs offered would appelées to the the of the statements of senators . 
this order is established to the ) 23 ( 6 ) . 
the clause has by , that the questions of privilege and the points to the Rules are await to the step of the Affairs offered and that all vote by call recorded asked is order to 17 p.m. 30 , except in case of motion without debate made without notice . 
of other provisions of the clause indiscriminately the time to which the will the period of the questions and the time to which the order of the day will called if the time provided for the Affairs offered is extensions . 
the period of the Affairs offered includes the Presented of reports of committees Standing or special , the notice of motions of the government , and that the notice of motions made by of other senators . 
usually , the chairmen are simply present their report and the senators limited notice of the motion . 
but to the opportunity , the leave is demandée of proceed on - the - face , or more later to the over of the day , to the discussion of the report of a committee . 
of same , to the step of the notice of motions , the chairman of a committee will the leave of present a motion for allow to the committee of the meet to a time where the Senate could be in sitting . 
these last years , all the duration where the Senate seat , the Leader Deputy of the government ask almost requests the leave of present a motion for that the Senate the while to 13 p.m. 30 the Wednesday rather that to 14 p.m. . 
each time that he is asked of déroger to the procedure of the Affairs offered , he the is of a notice in application of the sections 57 or 58 . 
the leave is granted if no senator present in the Room not the there against . 
if a only the there against , the question not can be most before the end of the deadline being . 
in addition , if the leave is granted , the Adopted of the report or of the motion is proposed on - the - face , except if the ask move of in until the review to more later to the over of the day . 
when the question Current to the report or to the motion is implementation to the Senators , she is sujette to debate . 
the fact that these questions requiring a notice the clear that they are subject to debate . 
no report of committee or motion of further who is the to the Senators not is soustrait to the possible of a debate . 
the fact that the motions made with the leave of the Senate to the step of the Affairs offered not are rarely or never debatable not means not that they not so not the be . 
only the motions made without notice not can be debatable . 
a time the debate in over , all the rules for the debates are applicable , there including the possible of a order to the Rules . 
that the to the fact that in whether that the question be implementation to the Senators , the Séant the is of this fact ruled of the Affairs offered for the term of the debate , until to this that he be tranché or adjourned . 
, my sense , the restriction of the ) 23 ( 1 ) , part the points to the Rules or the questions of privilege to the step of the Affairs offered , not the applies not to the debate , the given that the Senate not is s more to the step of the Affairs offered . 
if , by , , a ask of vote by call recorded is made to the end of the debate , the ) 23 ( 3 ) has that he will order to 17 p.m. 30 this day - that , except , well heard , if the leave is granted of the to to a other time . 
a other clause of the clause 23 the applies same if a debate is in over . 
the ) 23 ( 7 ) for that to the more later 30 minutes after the call of the Prime point of the Affairs offered , the Senate must to to the period of the questions . 
he is therefore possible that the review of the Affairs offered or a debate in over on a point of the Affairs offered be interrompu by the period of the questions . 
of fact , this is this who the is happened the 6 May 1993 when the debate in third Reading of the bill of bill C - 114 , amend the Act election of the Canada , has been asked immediately after the Presented of the report on the bill of bill , without amendment , by the committee of the Affairs legal and Constitutional . 
, this opportunity , the bill of bill had received the step of the third Reading before the end of the deadline of 30 minutes for the Affairs offered before the period of the questions . 
the Senate is then past to the review of the order of the day without to to the Affairs offered . 
is therefore in biggest this who can the to when the Senate accept of welcome a motion to the step of the Affairs offered . 
I hope that these Particulars you will of better understand this aspect of our procedures . 
this who the is past the Thursday 14 October last , when the senator Hays has asked the leave of present a motion to to extend the adjournment of the Senate , was therefore consistent to our rules and biodegradable .

all two , we will widely call to his bobbing in the days to come . 
I wish to congratulate the senators MLA and Furey of the excellent speech that they have speeches for propose and support the Adresse in response to the speech of the Throne . 
I me in like of not not add my congratulations to the many other that has showed our new Gouverneure general . 
his appointment proves that the dream Canadian not is not only a dream ; he the is chosen . 
. can the rise until to the more senior positions to the country and help of way very calibre to our vision collective of the Canada . 
what is this vision ? 
the Prime Minister the has opinion and in his response to the speech of the Throne : 
this is a Canada where each child is assured of a good departure in the life , where the young have the possible of the épanouir and of wasn their potential in the area of their choice , where the citizens have access to the knowledge and to the skills which they have need for excel . 
this is a Canada where the citizens , what that be their income , receive of the care of health of quality , where the families live in security in a community widest , where we work of together with of other country to promote the peace , the diversity cultural and the maximize of the new economy mondialisée ... 
this is a Canada who is a Leader and a model which the world world can the sustains . 
the sceptical say can - be that this are that of talk words and they the interrogeront can - be on their means real . 
fortunately , these words have a very important means . 
the government proving this vision through to the strategy who is stated in the speech of the Throne and to the words of which he the undertake to work in cooperation with the provinces and the territories for to to the point the Program national of action for the children . 
he proving this vision in by a plan of action national in the of skills and of learning for the st century . 
he the proving by the through of initiatives to to increase the access of the businesses Canadian to the markets world . 
he the proving through to of the programs who improve to improve the infrastructure of the know of the Canada , including by the creation of the instituts Canadian of research in health , and in benefiting more the research of forefront . 
he the proving in would of the measures who features our infrastructure of the information him . 
he proving this vision in conclusion of the initiatives for improve our Environment . 
honourable senators , this vision of the Canada is enthousiasmante and she can become reality . 
our country has received a turning . 
we we the of the order in our Finance , our budget is balanced and he the will . 
as the Gouverneure general we the has said in the speech of the Throne : 
the government is resolved to continue a policy of management financial prudent . 
more never he not will that the . perde the control of the Finance of the state . 
he will in so that the debt falling constantly by report to the happened within gross . 
he keeping the commitment taken to the beginning of this Parliament of spend the half of the surplus budget to the would of the debt and to the relief of the taxes , and the other half to the investment for to answer to the needs social and economic of the Canadians . 
honourable senators , he there has however of other realities in our country who require our attention . 
I just of a region who , during of many years , has suffered of the éloignement of the seat of the power economic and policy of the country . 
the Cape - Cape , to as of example , must into completely the economy . 
the the of this that recelait the under - soil , the Cape - Cape has seen the economy rest during of the generations on the mining of minerais who not are more exploitables of way effective to great the , of the least not as they the have been in the past , and on the industry of the steel who seems now have lost his reason of be economic . 
in reason of this accident geographical , the Cape - Cape not the is never fresher of a so criticism of industries of manufacturing or of industries of services one for wrestled to the addiction of these industries traditional based on the resources minérales . 
the most of the regions have had several decades for the adapt to the new realities economic , but the time is a luxury that not has not the Cape - Cape . 
he must the into election . 
he must do a great show in before in the development economic . 
he must the propulser , almost of the day to the next , in the new age post - industrial . 
I believe that the speech of the Throne contains a message of hope for the Cape - Cape and for the other regions similar of our great country . 
in the speech , the senator Furey has spoke of the identify who are in are of the having in his province , Newfoundland - Newfoundland and the Labrador . 
he has said : 
today today , Newfoundland - Newfoundland and the Labrador the people in the tourmente of the great changes technological and economic who balayent the world . 
the people of this region not the suggest however not just ; they are call to their skills and to their learning of long date for do opposite to the realities of the change quick . 
through to their creativity , their resort , their solidarity , their determination and their fiercely to the work , they if their dreams and choose to the before their province and their country . 
the computers and the Internet can main the opportunity between the city and the campaign , between the centre of the Canada and the provinces 32 , between the off and the poor . 
recently , I I heard speak of a human who in to Mount Pearl , to Newfoundland - Newfoundland , and who télétravaille for a business of collaborated of Los Angeles . 
the place where in this worker any little for the employer . 
all this who the , this is the ability and the branchement Internet . 
the people of my province , the Nova - Nova , the knows perfectly well . 
in all the across of the province , he there has of the dozens of businesses in Technology of the information who are ready to the start on the Highway of the information . 
the Scotians - Scotians are already on this Highway and some foncent to any track to the success . 
the Prime Minister of the Canada has set the objective : do of the Canada a Leader world in the use inventive of the Ministerial for do of the Affairs and encourage the expansion quick of the trade Ministerial to the Canada . 
honourable senators , the people of the Nova - Nova are the first to the Canada for this who is of the Purchase and of the sales of products by Internet . 
we we quickly including the opportunities of the Internet and we in advancement . 
I will you give a example . 
in 1995 , when the market estate fighting of the wing , the direction of two tours to offices jumelles in the centre - city of Halifax has known of seriously problems . 
these buildings , who constituency the sixth of the local to offices of the centre - city of Halifax , were seriously under - used . 
the direction has then decided of take of great risk . 
she has put the cable necessary to a access quick and of forefront to Internet . 
and , in November 1998 , the buildings of Purdy' s Wharf have dismantling the history in lone the Prime complex to the Canada provider of services Internet . 
this is a vision , a initiative and a Investment who have reported . 
in effect , Purdy' s Wharf who continued eight businesses of Technology of the information occupying 35 $ feet square in 1995 her now 40 businesses similar , who roles a neatly of 120 $ feet square . 
among his locataires , . find T & T Canada , Clear Picture Corporation , Fonorola , Fundy Communications , IBM Canada , iStar Internet , Knowledge Navigators International , Scotia Knowledge , companies Canada and Xerox Canada , for not in appoint that few - each . 
" by a system of carriers carriers , a powerful stretch of data is the to the clause of all the locataires , their ensuring 24 p.m. by day a access to Internet to little près100 time more quick that the modems by . 
. has also put the intranet for allow the réseautage between the locataires . 
other said , the he has into a market estate moribond in opportunity of Affairs , opportunity who has created a centre of Technology to the heart of the city of Halifax . 
the initiatives of this kind , as public that private , limited of good results . 
, Halifax , the rate of unemployment for the months of September was of 6,2p. per , be the rate the more there since the War War World . 
this rate is the same that the of Toronto and he is on to the average national of honoraria per for September . 
honourable senators , we we the ability necessary , and the government the reducing of do in so that all the Canadians , little any where they live to the country , have of the tools which they have need for wasn their potential . 
the Prime Minister has been very clear in the speech in response to the speech of the Throne when he has said : 
plug the Canadians - between them , with the schools and the library , with the culture , with the Administration public , with the trade and with the world - is the a of the major ways of hisser the Canada to the range of great economy World and of continue to in do a country to the opportunities without line . 
we must any to become the country the more branché to the world . 
still a time , the government has set of the aims very come for achieve this objective : 
and for the help to rates the use of the new technologies of the information , we recruterons until to 10 $ young Canadians who beat of the training to the citizens of all the unwelcome . 
honourable senators , the skills and the training are essential if the . to power benefit of these new opportunities . 
the government has announced that he Brunswickers of the partnerships with the other governments , the agencies public and private and that with the Canadians and the Canadians , to of establish a plan of action national in the of skills and of learning for the st century . 
let - me of you quote a other addressed of the speech of the seated : 
our economy to basic of know represents more that of the companies of high Technology . 
this is a economy who includes already of the grappes of development technologique in of small communities across to the Canada . 
in reality , this is a economy to the within of which the Technology can all to a more great stability economic in the regions primarily rural in which the industries of and of the resources cycle - agriculture , fisheries , Forestry , mines and tourism - constitute the major sources of foreign . 
the government favorisera the development and the Adopted of new technologies in all the sectors . 
back - in to my own province . 
how the Nova - Nova in contained she ? 
I you say of new that she in tirera of the benefits very come , honourable senators . 
the sector of the energy is very bode for the Canada Atlantic . 
I I personally very good hope that he will to the region of new sectors operating of research and of development to who , to their turn , could the lower by of the opportunities and of the applications fascinantes to the outside of the Canada Atlantic . 
the new Centre of excellence in the of development and of education in the sector of the Oil , established to the College university of the Cape - Cape , could serve of springboard to these activities of research and of development . 
I I recently had the opportunity of announce the to of the Institute of the Oil of the Canada Atlantic to the University Dalhousie to Halifax . 
these institutions working already together and concoctent indeed of the alliances with of great institutions of the industry of the Oil , in the world . 
of our days , the hailed agricultural one often to of the plants complex caractérisées by a growth manipulée and of the Hempline not saisonnières to great the . 
the industries traditional of and of the resources , as those of the Forestry and of the mines , about the influence of the research in biotechnologie . 
he and fréquent of be sitting behind a office allowing of having the rivage in the Cork of Lunenburg , then of cliquer on the bouton of a cat and of exchange of the information and of the ideas with of the people , of the other side of the world . 
honourable senators , he not enough not of show to our young to the serve of a computer or to programmer a logiciel . 
we must open their " and their spirit to the potential of the world who we surrounding . 
the government recognizes this fact . 
in the speech of the Throne , the government announcement that he will to the young Canadians of use their energy and their talents addition - sea in participant to of the programs international of Pages and in by the country in seaway of development to the plug on Internet . 
these experience can be of a great value , as the training concrete and direct that they may ; the knowledge learning in of other country and with of other Peoples ; the taken of conscience that the world is great but that the distance not must not we prevent of work together . 
this are that of the lessons important who features our young , the leaders of tomorrow , resource to do markets our communities and our country in the st century . 
this are that of the initiatives who can help as the small communities that the great centres urban . 
I I many confidence in the Canadians , and they have of more in more confidence in them - same . 
that they live to the community of our great centre urbain or in a small village isolated of the Atlantic or still in full forest of the British - British , the message of the speech of the Throne is that the distance not has never been also little important in our history . 
the government will in so that the Canadians , where that they live , have access to the tools which they have need for succeed in this new age post - industrial . 
that will he easy ? 
this not is never easy . 
build this country not has , certainly , not been easy . 
our ancestors have based this country in despite of a climate very rigorous , of the extensive disappear to although , and of deep differences linguistic , cultural and religious . 
what were the opportunity of success ? 
they not acceptaient not of be vaincus by these difficulties . 
we must to these pioneers who have imaginé this country and the have chosen of do a dream for the century who just . 
the new pioneers are well portants and live in the region of the Atlantic or across , to the Canada . 
these new pioneers , who make the dream of the st century , not tolerate not the prophètes of malheurs . 
honourable senators , our Gouverneure general has given a speech inspired to this House when she has tenure his new service . 
she has said : : 
we not must not we see as a people who reacts to the trends , but as a people who the challenges . 
we not must not we see as a people who reacts , but as a people who is . 
the government has said the intention of see this country proud and prosperous driver the world in the next millennium and beyond - beyond . 
we should all be privileged of be in legislation , in as that parliamentarians , of do in so that that the proving . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I wish to congratulate the Gouverneure general recently appointed and to him wish all the success wanted in his new duties of representative of the Leader of the state Canadian . 
Ms Clarkson unseemly to the a of our former colleagues who has made a one personal to a for ingrate and often little appréciée to his fair value . 
PuissentM. Roméo LeBlanc and his gracieuse wife , Diana , largest a long retirement pleased on the settle of the Strait of Northumberland . 
the policy can be also Dolly that grisante , and not only after of the election . 
the reports between the different players , often dénaturés by the ambitions personal , we it often rudement to the when . 
the success of a party policy , and personally of the Leader , what that be the déconvenues or the problems personal , is inexorably linked of the loyalty of the supporters . 
honourable senators , these comments me come to the spirit to the the of the withdrawal sudden of the senator Graham of his duties of Leader of the government to the Senate . 
during the mandate , the commitment of the senator to the regard of our institution and of the Nova - Nova not has never fact is each time that he the is acted for him of defend the objectives of the government and of the party . 
his qualities of man of honour and of principles not have never as been implemented to the when that the months last , and his conduct copy since in made a new time the evidence . 
that he me be for of borrowing the of of Edmund Burke for express my reaction to the limogeage if than of the senator Graham . 
the magnanimité in policy is often the unique seaway of the wisdom and the processes of a party policy is served by the spirit violate . 
: said , to the behalf of the members of our caucus and of me - same , I wish good opportunity to the senator Boudreau to the position of Leader of the government . 
however , the admission that he is here primarily for redorer the blason of the party in Nova - Nova , this that he has fact of way extraordinary in the speech that he has given he there has few believed , is troublante because she raises of the questions on the a in this House not elected in pending a for public élective . 
the senator Boudreau has said without ambages that he had the intention of be candidate to the House of the Commons to the next election . 
this is to my notice as if a player of the League national of hockey reappoint uphill the do refer in a ligue mineure . 
I hope that the senator Boudreau apprendra quickly to appreciate the importance and the accomplishments of the Senate and that he the make the that this is in this House that the bills of bill are the better studied , where the spirit of party not is never too given and where the supporters of the government , the ministers and the senators of second plan are all treated as of the individuals and not as of the automates , and that they the conventions in consequential , free of the constraint cut to our colleagues in the other place . 
the senators MLA and Furey , who have proposed and seconded the motion Current to the Adresse in response to the speech of the Throne , the are acquittés with great distinction and eloquence of their role . 
he not will however not seek in their comments other something that a civil reference to the speech who has so pesé to His Excellency and who did a much striking with the that she has given after the assermentation . 
the senator MLA in has fact little of case , not him focused that few oversaw paragraphs , and we has given a indication of the commitment deep to the country and the government , this that has fact also the senator Furey . 
in fact , they not had not the choice before a speech which . him as and who is immediately became a not - event . 
this who would should be a vision for the century to come the is into in a litanie of by . 
the sentiment of anticipation based on the Awaiting his of proposals concrete for solve the serious problems that we greatest now . 
however , to the great surprise of all , the speech of the Throne has past under silence the agriculture of the Western , who facing the worse crisis since the years 30 , the fisheries , who are in practices to of serious difficulties , the Immigration illégale , who trahit the failles of the legislation Canadian , the difficulties of the companies air that , same today today , the government rather that someone something called the " forces of the market " rule , and the reduction of the taxes who , if . déchiffre the few words who there are spent , will occasion fair before the next election . 
the poverty and the fate of the without - homeless not have hardly been mentioned . 
however , he there has two issues who have been broader in the speech of the Throne and which I like speak . 
the Prime respect the statement according which the government not will more never that the . perde the control of the Finance of the state . 
he is rassurant of see that those - that same who were that to the time and who have deliberately left the Finance of the nation go to the with have last by understand , same if care not has not been easy . 
I think in particular to the Prime Minister who , in as that chairman of the Council of the Board and Minister of the Finance in the years 70 , has many contributed to the Proceed of the deficit budget , who has sextuplé , and of the debt public net , who has doubled . 
this that the government not recognizes not , but which all the world the makes of more in more the , this is that the good results obtained to the plans budget and Monetary are related to the fact that the . has continued of apply the political adopted by the governments Mulroney , which the Liberal were interestingly to the time , to know the reduction of the Estimates of programs pursuant to the needs national real , the creation of a surplus of operating , the reduction of the rate of interest and a reduction of the rate of inflation . 
these results , who not would never could be achieved under the former Liberal , and the free - Exchange - are the opposed criticized these same members dépensiers - are now to the basic of the political current of the government , a government who tait effrontément the efforts tremendous made by the governments Mulroney , who is embarrassed by the subject Opposition that he has benchers against these measures when they have been surtaxes , including the tax on the products and services . 
in September 1990 , the Leader of the Party Liberal had said that : 
... the Position of the party is clear . 
we we opposons to the GST and not want not of his implementation in implement . 
recently , the Prime Minister has fact the he of this tax and ruled any attempt of the eliminate , and this same on the equipment of Reading , and that in has before a vote the here in September . 
the second point who draw my attention in the speech is more disturbing because he the on the future of our country . 
the government of the Canada ' therefore the commitment that he has taken to the Quebecers and all the other Canadians , to know that the principle of or statement by the Court Supreme of the Canada will respected . 
added to some comments least nuancés of some the - speak of the government , : it hear that in case of a referendum , the government Liberal has the intention of interpret to his way the opinion of the Court Supreme on the question of a vote favourable to the sovereignty ! 
I say opinion because this not is not a decision , but well a opinion that the Court Supreme has made . 
nothing in this opinion not locks who that this be . 
as to me , the court is for too far in dépassant the three questions that she was called to manner and , this by , she at to a debate policy who not is not of the resort . 
why ? 
as I believe that the Court Supreme is for too far in his out , as I am sorry that the government federal the say prepared to participate to a referendum , not only before that he not the é , but same before that he not be known ! 
the priority primordiale of all government national is the unity of the country , and never he not should question a may who would to the any of the - this . 
in interprétant to his way a series of conditions waves and tortuous of the Court Supreme , the government risk in effect of the find partner in a walking who could confirm sir to all the Canadians . 
I like conclude in issue of a subject concern shared by many , this is - to - say the fact that the Parliament , and particularly the House of the Commons , is of more in more déphasé . 
I not I never from my admiration for the form of government of the States - United , because their regime based on a system of popularly who limit the excesses which the a of the powers can the thoughts only . 
the more often , the chairman and the Congress are constantly to the research of compromise , because all the two are the major unquestionably of the development and of the Adopted clear of the laws . 
the mistakes of the executive and the camouflages not just not inaperçus well long , because , to the less leaves , the Congress fact inquiry . 
he so often , he is true , that the power legislative which exagérément the advantage that he has for delay we a appointment présidentielle or someone other initiative of the executive , but that not much nothing to the fact that the two powers are more or least on a at of equality and can rarely succeed the a without the other . 
the House not sitting that since few days when the government has imposed the stomping for to end to the debate on the bill of bill C - 6 . 
he has attack of in do as for the bill of bill on the agreed final nisga' has . 
why ? 
simply because these bills of bill , we said - . , have been debated , , and that a study more demonstrations to the Commons not would nothing of nine . 
can - . express more clear the for for the democracy Parliamentary ? 
unfortunately , the Senate has been treaty to little close of the same manner when he has been reminded for debate the bill of bill C - 32 , on the Environment , and the bill of bill C - 78 , on the Pension . 
sitôt in position , the new Minister of the Environment has announced that the bill of bill C - 32 had been enough length debated and that no amendment not would agreed . 
, the committee , the majority has imposed the stomping , then a report unanimous has been has to the Senate saying that the bill of bill was entaché of so of imperfections that a review should planned immediately after the Adopted . 
the stomping has been put to the third Reading , the senators government benefiting that , same if the bill of bill had of many faults , he former higher to the bill existante . 
in would the bill of bill C - 32 , the majority to the Senate has in fact consciemment seconded a bill of bill all in knowing that he would should do the subject of a review more thorough , according the role by of the Senate . 
this not is not that the a of his best accomplishments . 
the bill of bill on the Pension has been we of the months of June to the months of September for give to the Council of the Board and to the Alliance of the Fonction public the opportunity of the meet to the over of the been for attempt of correct some misunderstandings , all particularly in this who touchait the are exceed . 
the Council of the Board has refused of meet the union for discuss of the question , alléguant that these are belonged to the government . 
the new chairman of the Council of the Board the is montrée also inflexible . 
. not has therefore the no the of the judgment unanimous of the Senate . 
, the over of the debate of third Reading , . we has fact know that if the union wanted do current his claims relatively to the sharing of the surplus , he should agrees a any in justice . 
that still , the Senate has forsaken his responsibilities traditional to the chapter of the review carefully to of respect a education came of the outside that that the bill of bill be adopted despite his weaknesses . 
I I underlined more earlier that the new Leader of the government to the Senate had been impressed of the amount of work that we how here by report to this who the fact to the other place . 
I am of notice that this who the is happened in September is should more to the forward who reciting a prorogation that to a effort volunteer in view of reduce the contributions of the Senate to the process Parliamentary and I am sure that to the over of this new session , we reprendrons our responsibilities traditional , all in the always well to the fact of the désirs of the House elected . 
I believe well also that the about their that that . withdraw to the Opposition all the these of committee that she ' except a not are not based . 
not any what observer independent not can that recognize that the these of committee busy by of the colleagues of my party to the over of the first session of the , Parliament have been orchestrated with distinction and to the honour of the Senate . 
any attempt of reduce without excuse the contribution of not - supporters of the government to the system of the committees the heurtera to a robust resistance , not not by with raisers but because that the great value of our institution based on a touchstone of cooperation and not of a step . 
, the time where we were dispelled of the side of the Opposition , we we resisted several time - well that with difficulty , I the saying - to the envy of do of the obstruction for the happy of do of the obstruction , this who has been the case during a good part of the years 80 and in 1990 when the roles were overthrow . 
we we worked deliberately to the rejection of two bills of bill , regarding the airport Pearson and regarding the spent of the card election , because they were clear anticonstitutionnels . 
we cover always to the spirit that the will of the representatives elected must be respected , portion that she the timely in the line of the Constitution . 
honourable senators , the success of the Senate the legislation not not by the and of a majority for do adopt of the bills of bill to the steamship , but rather by the contribution of all the senators to the improvement of the measures legislation who we parviennent of the other place . 
not give to the Opposition that a role about in this process , this would into the Senate in a image faithful of the House of the Commons and give still more of no to those who at to do abolish our institution . 
a such attitude could easily destroy the spirit present of cooperation and of harmony who , he is ironic of the see , not is not abroad to the respect of the Opposition for the Senate , a respect that the majority , I the hope , continue of share . 
( on the motion of the senator Hays , the debate is adjourned . ) 
bill of bill admissibility the taken of some decisions medical 
second Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
- honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 2 has for subject of facilitate the taken of decisions medical by of the patients in perpetuate against any responsibility criminal the coping who respect the wishes of their patients . 
more specifically , the bill of bill clarifie the laws in perpetuate the coping who the abstiennent of administering a treatment of survival to the ask of the patient or in interrompent the Administration , or who administrent of the pharmacare to of inevitable of strong hear physical . 
this bill of bill for also that the Minister of the Health can establish of the lines guidelines national and promote the education and the training relatively to the forbearance of administering of the treatment of survival , of deal the pain and of administering of the care palliative or to their interruption . 
the bill of bill S - 2 , which the as abrégé is Act admissibility the taken of some decisions medical , is the third bill of bill of this kind to be presented in this House these last years . 
honourable senators , the 27 November 1996 , I I presented the bill of bill S - 13 , to to amend the Code criminal ( protection of the coping ) . 
this bill of bill is was in plan during of the outbreak of the election federal in May 1997 . 
, the over of the last session of the , Parliament , the senator Th Roux - Roux has presented the bill of bill S - 29 , who had the same objective General that the bill of bill S - 13 , the protection of the patients and of the coping . 
the bill of bill S - 29 is death to the Paper during of the prorogation of the Parliament in September . 
, my notice , the bill of bill S - 2 , Act admissibility the taken of some decisions medical , intègre the better of the bills of bill S - 13 and S - 29 . 
however , I want that he be well clear for all the senators that I not consider not this bill of bill as the hall . 
I the consider as the bill of bill of the Committee Special of the Senate on the euthanasia and the assistance to the suicide . 
he is the result of the work of the former senator Joan , , of the senators Roux - Roux , Corbin , Beaudoin , DeWare , Keon and me - same , since I I sat to the committee , me also . 
if I devais balladeer this bill of bill to someone a , this would to the late senator ë at , who , same the he not was not member to share full of the committee , has replaced her the senator DeWare several months , during that she solve the husband patient , and who has continued of dialogue with we until to this that he be him - same to the taken with a illness seeks . 
the honourable senators find that the bill of bill S - 2 starts by a preamble . 
the 23 February 1994 , the committee Senate Special on the euthanasia and the assistance to the suicide has been up for examine the aspects legal , social and Ethics of the euthanasia and of the assistance to the suicide . 
they have relates to the care palliative and to the refusal of receive a treatment for to maintain the duties ingenuity or to the v. of this type of treatment . 
they have relates to the control of the pain . 
the 6 June 1995 , the committee has submitted to the Senate the report entitled : " Ban the life and of the death " . 
according me , the preamble of this bill of bill is essential for give to the Senate the deserves who him up of full right . 
some editors of laws not unhappy not the préambules . 
however , in the case present , he not is not only positive , but he makes justice to the committee , who has worked very durum . 
I like now speak of points speak of the bill of bill S - 2 . 
the clause 2 of the bill of bill for that no provider of care of health not can be recognized found of a offence in under of the Code criminal for have administered to a human of the pharmacare with the intention of inevitable or of do people his suffering physical , to of the sharply " abréger his life . 
in the report entitled : " Ban the life and of the death " , the committee Senate Special recognizes that the practice who is to deal the patient of manner to inevitable his suffering , same if she can abréger the life of the patient , is now legal . 
the Code criminal not , not the care palliative , same if that can abréger the life of the patient , in as that the care are Service of way consistent to the practices medical generally scant . 
however , a sure number of witnesses have said to the committee that the doctors hésitaient often to administering enough of pharmacare antidouleur if that walked of abréger the life of the patients , of fear of be held criminellement responsible of the Late of their patients . 
of very many witnesses him to described the confusion who " as home the professionals of the health that to the within of the people in General as to the legality of the practice , the committee Senate Special has recommended to the unanimously that the provisions appropriate of the Code criminal be clarified . 
many are the doctors the spécialisant in the care palliative who would that the treatment of the pain not abrège never the life of the patient . 
according some evidence collected , when the does of the pharmacare is well resolved , the patients the adaptent simply to the through increased of the pharmacare administered . 
however , we not in we no evidence and , to my notice , that not is not the true question . 
all as that we are , we should ensure to this that the patients to the Canada suffering the least possible . 
the committee Senate not is not the only to clamour that . clarifie the provisions of the Code criminal who them on the possible of administering a treatment who , all in atténuant the pain , risk of abréger the life of the patient . 
the Board of reform of the right had some the same recommendation in a report that she has was in 1983 . 
of more , the Association medical Canadian written the confusion of the bill in this area since 1992 . 
the committee Senate Special flies the expression more general of " treatment for to inevitable the suffering " , but the clause 2 of the bill of bill is some of way to exclude the situations where of the pharmacare are administered for inevitable of the suffering émotionnelles or psychological . 
, my notice , he must user of taken and nothing in this bill of bill not should significant the controversy , and yet we know all that the treatment of the suffering émotionnelle or psychological prepared to the controversy . 
the clause 2 not protects not the coping in the case where he could there have a other kind of responsibility criminal , as the neglect criminal . 
honourable senators , understand - me well : the clause 2 not the applies absolutely not to the case where he there has intention of resulting the death . 
he not the applies that in the case where the . to inevitable the suffering physical of the patient . 
he is very important of the out . 
none not should wrestled to his responsibility criminal if the intention is of killing someone a . 
the ) 3 ( 1 ) of the bill of bill S - 2 for that the soignant not is not found of a offence the by the Code criminal of the only fact that to the ask of a human able , he the abstient of him administering a treatment of survival or in abrupt the Administration . 
the ) 3 ( 2 ) clarifie the circumstances in which a ask is considered valid to the for of the ) 3 ( 1 ) . 
of the instructions written pre , ensure to the laws of a province , will always above . 
the most of the provinces have already adopted of the provisions legislation on the instructions pre . 
the Alberta is the last province to have adopted a bill to this about ; in effect , the Personal 2:07 Act has been proclaimed and is into in into the 1 December 1997 . 
the Manitoba , Newfoundland - Newfoundland , the Nova - Nova , the Ontario and the Quebec have also légalisé the drafting of this that the . Order , in the niceties , the testaments biological . 
the British - British and to the Island - Edward - Prince - Edward have adopted of the laws in this the , but those - this not are not still in into . 
, is of instructions written data préalablement pursuant to the laws of a province , of the guidelines written not official or a ask made unfettered or by warning , in presence of to the least a witness , constitute a ask valid . 
the ) 3 ( 3 ) for that a other ask can be made by a agent , a representative legal or a earnings , but only if the patient not has not the ability of the do or if , during that he in was able , he not has not fact of ask valid . 
in the report entitled : " Ban the life and of the death " , the committee Senate Special has defined the forbearance of treatment of survival as the the fact of not not begin a treatment a of maintain the patient in life , by example not not attempt the distress cardiorespiratoire ( RCR ) , not not give a blood therapy , not not administering of antibiotics or not not ensure the food and the hydratation artificielles . 
he has defined the interruption as the fact of stop a treatment a of maintain the patient in life , by example débrancher the respirateur . 
the committee Senate Special has underlined that the courts Canadian have recognized to the patients the right in way way of refuse a treatment medical or of from that a treatment , a time began , be interrompu . 
in of the Affairs as Malettec. Schulman , in 1990 , Nancy B . . Hôtel - God of Quebec , in 1992 and in the case Rodriguez , in 1993 , the courts have wording recognized this right , same if the consequential of this forbearance or of this interruption of treatment of survival is the death . 
I think that he is important of to on some of these causes with you . 
in the case Mallettec. Schulman , in 1990 , the Court of call of the Ontario has said that the instructions on the transfusions blood data during that a wait in was able were be followed , same if she not had not the ability of take a decision . 
the court has felt that the doctor was respect the instructions written of a witness of Jéhovah who refuses any blood therapy , same in a situation of emergency where the wait not could give the consent . 
, the words of the decision that she has made in January 1992 in the case Nancy B . , the Court Superior of the Quebec has felt that the wait adulthood able , they of a illness incurable and alitée until to the end of his days , had the right of ask that the doctor débranche the respirateur who the maintenait in life . 
in by his decision , the Justice Dufour has quoted the sections of the Code Civil of the Quebec according which the human human is inviolable and none not can be forced of order a treatment without the consent . 
this case address also of the responsibility criminal of the doctor who was , to the ask of Nancy B . , débrancher the respirateur . 
after the be order to the sections 216 , 217 , 45 and 219 of the Code criminal , and that to the provisions on the the homicide , the Justice has concluded that a doctor not was not evidence of a conduct unreasonable , gratuite or entailed in débranchant the respirateur of a wait to the ask of the - this and in leaving the illness of the wait follow the over natural . 
in 1993 , Mr. the Justice Sopinka , of the Court Supreme of the Canada , who has prepared the decision majority in the case Rodriguez , has also recognized the right of the patients of not not increase to a treatment or of ask that the treatment be interrompu , same if the death was in revisited . 
he is important of the remind that , in this case , the majority not was not in favour of the euthanasia and of the assistance to the suicide . 
she was however in favour of the right to the forbearance or to the interruption of the treatment , right who is the subject of the bill of bill to the study . 
however , honourable senators , of the witnesses have said before the committee Special that , in some case , . not had not respected the chamber of the patients because that the Code criminal not was not clear and that the coping did of be held responsible . 
, because of these evidence on the confusion who there among the coping and the people in General , the committee Senate Special has recommended to new to the unanimously that the way way in into be codifiée of way to clarify the circumstances in which he is legally acceptable of not not provide or of interrupt a treatment of survival . 
still that , the committee Senate not was not the Prime to recommend that the right be clarifié in this area . 
in 1983 , the Board of reform of the right of the Canada had recommended she also that the Code criminal be clarifié to this regard . 
since 1992 , the Association medical Canadian advocating that the Code criminal be clarifié in this who respect the right legal of to end to a treatment to of to the coping to the homeless of the the . 
honourable senators , the clause 6 of the bill of bill S - 2 is the more is example of the fusionnement of my bill of bill distinct , the S - 13 , and of the bill of bill of the senator Roux - Roux , the S - 29 . 
the bill of bill S - 29 provided the to of lines guidelines for the treatment of the pain and for the forbearance and the interruption of treatment of survival . 
the clause 6 of the present bill of bill for that the Minister of the Health which , in cooperation with the authorities provincial and the associations of the professionals of the health , of the lines guidelines national relatively to the forbearance and to the interruption of treatment of survival , to the treatment of the pain and to the care palliative . 
the bill of bill allows to the Minister of the Health of promote and of encourage the education of the great public and the training of the professionals of the health regarding the treatment of the pain and the care palliative . 
the bill of bill for also that the . monitors the number of time that he there will had forbearance or interruption of the treatment of survival and that the . slow of the investigations and that the . the of the research to this effect . 
in the report entitled : " Ban the life and of the death " , the committee Special of the Senate has recognized the importance of lines guidelines national in these areas . 
of many witnesses who are came before the committee have recommended that . give more of information and of training to the providers of care of health on the care palliative and the control of the pain . 
almost all the witnesses who have appeared before the committee Special of the Senate the canvassing to say that of the research more remarkable were necessary in these areas . 
honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 2 is the result direct of the work of the committee Special of the Senate on the euthanasia and the suicide attended . 
, my notice , he meeting the best elements of the two bills of bill precedents who have been made to the Senate . 
he is to clarify the right pénal in codifiant the way way existante and in the by accessible and understandable for all the Canadians , to of protect the patients and their providers of care of health . 
I forward with forward the debate on this bill of bill . 
this who is more important still , I forward with forward the study in committee , where . chair and would this legislation of way more thorough . 
I am particularly pleased of the participation of the senator Roux - Roux , who , as me , to that the recommendations of the committee Special of the Senate among bill . 
this bill of bill not is can - be not still exactly this that he must . 
unfortunately , in as that people human , we not are not very . 
I hope that the committee Senate of the Affairs legal and Constitutional chair this bill of bill carefully to of the ensure that he does to the needs of the Canadians and that he there reformation of the amendments for the improve to the need . 
I want that this bill of bill be also good that he can the be , and I know that this is also that the desire of the senator Roux - Roux and of the other members of the committee Special of the Senate . 
I hope that we able refer this bill of bill quickly to the committee to that the study , who , of by his nature , will many of time , can begin without delay , before that the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , recognized for his long p.m. and the time responsible , not be to the taken with the job for of the measures legislation of initiative government . 
honourable senators , I you urge to examine the bill of bill S - 2 and I you urge to the support . 
the hon. Douglas Roche : 
her the senator would - she of answer to a question ? 
the senator Carstairs : 
certainly . 
the senator Roche : 
thank . 
I want of first express my recognition to the senator Carstairs for the kindly which she has fact evidence in showing the bill of bill . 
I hope that he there will a debate thorough on this important question and that . not cherchera not to the mothballing of this bill of bill to the forward , to that . that ample the opportunity , as to the step of the second Reading to the Senate that to the step of the study in committee , of in do the review that he deserves . 
in way of preparation to my contribution to the debate of this last , I like question two questions to the senator Carstairs , if she the to well . 
of first , the senator Carstairs has said without answer that the bill of bill was to relieve the pain and not to écourter the life , but as the fact of relieve the pain can have for effect of écourter the life , the senator Carstairs lead - she that that can open the the to the suicide attended ? 
she has said very clear that of the treatment tremendous for extend the life not are not necessary of a point of view déontologique , but , in the treatment of the patients in stage seeks , not there has he not a danger that the various pressure the acted so all to a form of your or of pressure in favour of the use of pharmacare atténuant the pain to of the for secret , or to of the for not déclarées openly , who consistent in fact to écourter the life ? 
the senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I thank the senator of his question , because that such is guarantee the part essential of any the question . 
this is why we must have of the lines guidelines and of the ways of control . 
I renverrais the senator to the catéchisme of the Church Catholic , including to the clause 2279 , because that the difference there is enough clear stated . 
the catéchisme said : : 
same if the death is judged imminente , . not can legitimately interrupt the care ordinary to terminally to a patient . 
the use of analgésiques for relieve the suffering of the mourant , same to the risk of abréger his days , can be considered morally consistent to the dignity human , if the death not is not deal as a end or a way . 
for me , this kind of confusion is if necessary that if the bill of bill not the contains not , we must we ensure that she there found . 
I think that this is already the case , but if , modifions - the for that this be absolutely clear . 
the senator Roche : 
I thank the hon. senator . 
the response is certainly useful to the essential of the debate . 
my second question the on the Code criminal . 
I not see not very well why the bill of bill is to codifier the way way existante or to Authorize some actions who could indeed be which as of the actions criminals without have to amend the Code criminal him - same . 
why to - . avoid of amend the Code criminal in would the bill of bill ? 
the senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , still a time , I thank the hon. senator of his question . 
he is interesting of out that , in the Prime bill of bill that I I presented , he there had a amendment of the Code criminal . 
however , to the over of the debate and of the discussions to the Senate , and also by the the , in the bill of bill of the senator Roux - Roux , he is became obvious that we take more that a amendment of the Code criminal . 
we tentions also of establish of the lines guidelines national and of to in place of the measures of control and of do do of the experience and of the business of research on the control of the pain . 
( on the motion of the senator DeWare , to the behalf of the senator Roux - Roux , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the strategy of the housing for the aboriginal 
inquiry - Adjourned of the debate 
the hon. Thelma J . Chalifoux , pursuant to the notice given the 14 October 99 : 
- honourable senators , he is difficult for the most of the Canadians of understand why he sphere of the differences between the conditions of life and the challenges of the aboriginal and those of the other citizens of the Canada . 
he is also difficult for them of understand why he must adopt of the solutions different in reason of the situation , of the rights , of the values and of the potential of the aboriginal . 
that is can - be difficult to understand , but he is essential of the understand for power advance in harmony . 
the strategy of the housing is to determine if the recent decisions of the government federal will of improve the conditions of housing of the families aboriginal and if of important improvements can be made to the strategy federal current . 
this document of work is for to facilitate a real dialogue on the major makes of a strategy who we will enter in the next century and on the better way of the to in implement . 
we we chosen of we stop on the forces of all the Peoples to the Canada and the sources of these forces for in happen to a strategy contemporary . 
a source of force sometimes overlooked and implementation of side is the will and the right of the Peoples aboriginal - the tis , the Inuit and the members of the Nations Nations - of seek and of to in implement their own solutions . 
this is this force who has in the launch with success of hundreds of initiatives from of the basic . 
sometimes , they have been gênées by of the tracasseries administrative or not have could all for a reason whatever . 
of other initiatives from of the aboriginal them - same have in the provision of the networks regional and then national , and that of the institutions important on which we comptons now . 
if we can better combiner the points strong of the aboriginal and of the Canadians in General and unable these forces for improve the housing , we will fact many more that anyone could the there expect . 
I will now me look on the scope and the subject of the strategy in the of housing for the families aboriginal . 
some can think that we not we not need of a other study on the conditions of housing or a study on the ways of amend the programs national in the hope that the families aboriginal so in from some benefits . 
we are of agreed . 
too of these studies have already been Conducted and have led to a low improvement of the conditions of life . 
of more , we we all could benefit of the advice and of the research without precedent of the Board Royal on the Peoples aboriginal , in 1996 . 
we seeing now the first accomplishments of the initiative " Strength our forces " , the plan of action that the government federal has launched in January 1997 . 
we had hoped that of other partners in the Confederation annonceraient them also their plans and their priorities . 
, this chapter , we are disappointed . 
some progress are weaknesses , but several senators and leaders aboriginal the concern of more in more of the lack of measures concrete taken for improve the conditions of housing of the families aboriginal . 
we want flourishing a dialogue national on the need of establish a strategy clear and more dynamic in the of housing for the families aboriginal . 
we want we stop on the direction future of a strategy for the families living to the outside of the reserves and of the Lands implemented of side for the Peoples aboriginal in the framework of agreements on the claims land concern . 
the families aboriginal living on these Lands have , to the words of treated and of the bill , of the conditions of housing who diffèrent many of those of the families living , . 
what that he in be , any strategy in the of housing must to the of the mouvements of people on these Lands . 
many of tis , of Inuit and of members of the Nations Nations will leave the communities ancestrales for seek of the work , of the opportunities prometteuses and of the housing decent in the major and small cities of the Canada . 
this is a trend growing who will the continue . 
. knows well also that their rate of natalité is higher to the average national , all as the number of their young is more high , since the people aboriginal is 10 years more young that the people in General . 
he there has 50 years , . dénombrait least of 200 $ aboriginal . 
today today , he there in has more of 1 million who live to the Canada . 
this figure not includes not however the people of the tis of the country . 
many of other aboriginal live to the States - United and can or not to to the country after their years of work . 
. for that the people aboriginal will increase drama $ people to the over of the next generation . 
his conditions Social and economic not found that of modest improvements . 
a strategy in the of housing reasonable must power answer to the needs future some of the people aboriginal and to the new priorities . 
I will now explain why the conditions and the problems of housing of the aboriginal are different . 
a reason important for which more of the half of the families aboriginal live today today in of the housing lower to the standards is a great poverty persistante . 
many are often on the point of the on in the street or will live in of the communities rural , urban and vital already surpeuplées . 
the jobs that the aboriginal find are difficulty paid and they must use to the safeguarded their cheque of paye for answer to the needs basic in food and in Clothing of families more many that the average . 
. believe that the income of employment of the aboriginal 1 to the two third of the of the average national . 
more of 40 per of between them not had not of income of employment in 1995 . 
they have little or not of credit . 
that arriverait - he if the aboriginal were obtain the 50 with the Canadians ways in the of employment and of salary ? 
course , that their would a level of life higher and all the Canada in profiterait . 
in 1991 , the former Minister of the Affairs Indian and of the North Canadian , Thomas Siddon , stated that , the he there had 50 of here the year 2000 , the happened national gross of the Canada would of increase the income tax of the government federal of 4,3 billion of $ and of reduce the debt national of 20 billion of $ . 
the commission Royal there is for of his own analysis on this point . 
she has esteemed that he in cost to the Canada 7,5 billion of $ double as that the circumstances economic and Social of the Peoples aboriginal demeureraient pushed to the average national . 
he any of note that this amount 1 to a loss of income net of 2,9 billion of $ for the Peoples aboriginal , combinée to a cost tax of 4,6 billion of $ , there including 2,1 billion of $ under form of lack to gain for the government . 
unfortunately , a strategy to to answer to the needs in the of housing will tragic with a problem of poverty aiguë home the aboriginal , because that nothing not the that the disparités economic and Social between the people in General and the aboriginal will soon people . 
the recent increase of the rate of literacy and of the levels of education in General will some families , but the housing done would inabordables for a well too great number of aboriginal . 
the vertical economic have been down many too slowly to the over of the 20 last years for let believe that the . the is he of the problem of the poverty home the aboriginal . 
some are more evident that of other . 
taken together , these reasons have caused many of difficulties . 
if we want we determining of a strategy in the of housing who based on of the basis solid , he would course of examine some of these reasons . 
the discrimination under all his forms remains the a of the causes who follows the sad situation of the housing home the aboriginal . 
she was to this time the beside of Corporation core of Mortgage and of housing . 
close of 30 years more later , the program of housing rural to the intention of the aboriginal has seen the day . 
the Program of housing of the aboriginal in community urbain has followed in 1978 . 
the new commitments in the of housing in the framework of these programs have taken end in same time that the government federal has up of take of the commitments in the of housing social the 1 January 1994 . Pendant any his term , the program of housing of the aboriginal not has never fact the subject of a assessment . 
the disparités held also to the low priority granted to the questions of housing of the aboriginal . 
this situation could including the explain by the lack of representation aboriginal to the Parliament of the Canada and of participation of the aboriginal to the service public federal . 
the arcanes of the power rely little of aboriginal for draw the attention on the problems matching or on their solutions . 
that allowed many more easily of forget the conditions in which they Ouje . 
fair to the time where the Canadians six to be more aware of the needs of the aboriginal , the priorities national have changed . 
this situation unwitting fact that the conditions of life upgraded of the Canadians éclipsent the reality of the aboriginal . 
honourable senators , the idea according which the problems aboriginal and the solutions to there to not are that a version reduced of the problems existing and of the solutions to to to the the of the Canada is a other reason who ask the responding results and accomplishments to the within of the companies aboriginal . 
nothing not the to believe that a similar strategy that given of good results to the over of the years . 
in reality , this is a model not to more of credibility , and of important studies of the conditions Social and economic , there including the study of December 1998 on the clochardise , " the Adopted of strategies separate for to the of the realities which are opposite the aboriginal . 
well that of the services to the aboriginal be came the add to the programs of management of the housing , the political and programs of basic are those who are designed for solve the problems not aboriginal , and the governments federal and provincial in are the managers . 
the problems of jurisdiction debates to the housing of the aboriginal through , that on the Lands réservées to these effect we which insurmountable . 
the most of the authorities provincial , land and aboriginal the in reviewers essentially to the government federal . 
yet , the transfers of funds , the points of tax , the powers and the Administration overwhelmingly more of responsibilities to the provinces . 
this transfer of skills raises the controversy and freine the progress of this matter . 
this not are that that few - few of the reasons who follows the differences observed to the as of the housing of the aboriginal and of the difficulties overnment to this as by these the . 
we the memories in the hope that they we undoubtedly to find of the solutions future to the problem of the housing . 
he not there had not of bad intentions to the departure . 
the reasons historic and juridico - political to the poverty , to the impuissance and to the blood subis by the companies aboriginal reviewers a other problem - which are of the commission Royal of inquiry and the evidence of many leaders aboriginal . 
he will without say that these reasons prépondérantes dirty of all their negative on the status socioéconomique on of the aboriginal today today . 
honourable senators , I like now speak briefly of the consequences of the strategies federal fellow . 
the strategies federal of the 25 last years have been reduced to a succumb of grants for of the brought in of , of the upkeep of emergency , a civil program of construction domiciliaire , a program precise of construction of housing in community urbain , a program of construction in community rural to for objective a rate of occupation of 50 per of the housing by of the aboriginal , of the appropriation of tax , of the Allowance for the housing , and of the bills of self - assistance , including of recount to the ownership , who have fact long fire . 
the authorities provincial and municipal have participated to the Estimates incurred , but in part only . 
, as of example , the program of housing of the aboriginal in community urbain not has been supported that by the loyers paid by the aboriginal and of the grants federal . 
of the committees tripartites have been constitués , are participaient in some case of the once of services . 
of the forecasts of Estimates recent of the Mortgage regarding the aboriginal outside reserves were of of a expenditure Annual of the order of 172,5 million of $ to the as of the housing . 
the programs more important of construction in as urbain and rural have for to of the families aboriginal of live in of the housing to price reasonable . 
Quelque10 8,700 housing urban are through to of the families aboriginal ; he the is of housing social them and moreover by a 100 of companies to purpose not profit . 
someone 9 per other housing them in community rural are busy by of the families aboriginal . 
the most have been " through to of the programs of assistance to the recount to the ownership . 
these figures vary according the source and are filed by of many leaders aboriginal . 
this are that few - each of the results positive of the strategies federal pensioners . 
, that he must add the results positive of programs of renovate , of upkeep of emergency , of research and of démonstration , without forget the programs to the intention of the people seniors and of the people disabilities . 
for those and those who not connaîtraient not the vertical observed in the conditions of housing , a series of chamber found in Printed . 
I déposerai the room " . 
honourable senators , say that the vertical are great not enough not to understand the life difficult that slow the tis , the Inuit and the Peoples of the Nations Nations . 
a family aboriginal on three has a need essential of housing , compared to a family not aboriginal on ten . 
the need essential of housing is a legislation fundamental for determine that a family in in of the conditions pushed to the normal and not has not the ways of the offer a greater habitable get . 
he there has ten , about 63 $ families aboriginal had a need essential of housing . 
the people has increased and the percentage of the families to a need essential of housing rest three time more high that the average national . 
the number of Diaspora not has of increase . 
the report of December 1998 of the Group of work of the mayor on the without - homeless of Toronto which a other impact of the strategies who have failed in this area . 
in 1996 , someone 4 $ aboriginal were without - homeless in the only region of Toronto . 
someone 8 $ other risquaient of the on in this situation , there including of many children . 
he is poses that the situation who prevails to Toronto the apparent to the who has over in of other cities , including the six other cities Canadian who are densément peuplées of aboriginal . 
a aboriginal on five in in seven areas metropolitan . 
this are that of the figures were , but he we must alters more the effects of the strategies federal fellow if we want from of the lessons of the mistakes and of the opportunities watch and visa on the points strong . 
a of these points strong , this is the evolution of the companies aboriginal of housing . 
these companies the are disclosed very useful and fiables . 
the the the Speaker : 
senator Chalifoux , I am sorry of you interrupt , but your 15 minutes are period . 
are - you the Authorized of continue ? 
the senator Chalifoux : 
yes . 
the the the Speaker : 
the leave is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Chalifoux : 
I you thank , honourable senators . 
of the hundreds and of the hundreds of volunteers have spent of their time to these companies then that the dozen of employees dedicated the are busy of manage the business of construction , of maintain the canoeing of housing and of offer of the services to the locataires and to the claimants . 
the matter urbain to him only worth now more of 500 million of $ . 
any a range of services are services by the staff in position and of other services are need by the through of a system public established between various agencies of services aboriginal , this who includes of the programs as the Program of assistance préscolaire to the aboriginal , the activities cultural , the training and the mutual and that the services and activities of the centres of reaction the case if . 
of the positions are created in the area of the construction and of the maintenance , of the contracts are accorded to of the businesses , of the taxes foncières and of the taxes are fellows , and particularly , of the families have the opportunity of the take in with and of the start on the market private . 
I can you speak of a family , by example . 
for the first time , I can buy of the oranges for my children . " 
they waiting of in have the opportunity them also . 
this is a wonderful way of strengthen their identity , a way essential of keep the young aboriginal to the homeless of the bad situations in which the find many of young , and that the Custody to the school . 
a modest housing in of best will has given the tranquility of spirit and a sentiment of security to the women , to the children and to the seniors aboriginal . 
these results not are not the headlines , but they have the the life better to many of people and they have created a ability and a desire of do well more . 
the relations remain still médiocres between the aboriginal and some governments local , but they can become best with the time . 
, the least , the problems of housing and the companies of habitation have for of begin a dialogue , if nothing of other not can the help . 
the companies of habitation aboriginal have also someone something of rare . 
this is the only institution who , a profile to day of the families aboriginal and who provides the way of the reach easily . 
their understaffed of Awaiting , jointes to those of the locataires existing , their allow of in know a little to comments of thousands of families aboriginal and to comments of the evolution of their conditions of existence . 
that is a tool important for coordinating the services to the more those in the society aboriginal . 
what are the choice for a future strategy to to answer to the needs of the aboriginal in the of housing and to the new priorities ? 
the conditions gloomy of housing that are the Peoples aboriginal backed to from that . take of the measures . 
despite that , of other priorities the are day who over the attention . 
according of the figures recent , 46p. per of the children aboriginal of least of five years who live in the major areas metropolitan live in of the families 9,300 . 
this rate represents seven time the rate for the people in General . 
close of a third of all the children aboriginal live in of the families 9,300 . 
the most of the families 9,300 have to their head a woman . 
he will to in place a strategy extremely well coordinated for satisfy to the needs of these families in the of housing and of health , for satisfy to their needs Cultural and economic and for satisfy to the needs of the young children . 
the trend demographics fact an the young age of the people aboriginal , and this trend the shall . 
the number of children of least of five years by woman aboriginal in age of procréer is 70 time more high that the rate for the total of the people Canadian . 
of the salaries there and a rate of unemployment high are makes among the young , still more among the young aboriginal . 
since that he has been the end to the construction of new housing subsidized in 1994 , the list of the aboriginal in Awaiting of a housing the is allongée . 
he is obvious that the canoeing of housing social present not can welcome the families aboriginal or not the accept not . 
these last years , the provinces have reduced their commitments or there have the end and he not there not of figure definitive on the number of families aboriginal logées in of the housing social . 
he any of do out that the housing social are made on the basic of the audit of the solvabilité and of the below of the income , this who , the access of the aboriginal to of the housing subsidized for to the not - aboriginal . 
the commission Royal has esteemed that he will necessary of build 17 $ new housing and of proceed to of important business of one on 37 $ other for power settling the backlog between 1996 and 2016 . 
in addition , 21 higher new Diaspora related to the growth demographics and to the training of new families will also need of assistance . 
without assistance financial , the level of life of these people should cut still , and the number of families in the need should increase . 
, the the of the decisions taken recently by the government federal , of the funds for the Administration of the housing social have been transferred to the provinces who have agreed this arrangement . 
the Ontario , the Quebec , the British - British and the Alberta have now deliberation for this formula . 
the agreements of transfer automobiles the programs of housing for the aboriginal in the areas rural and urban . 
the process of transfer has brought enormous of conflict and of differences between the Mortgage and the providers of housing aboriginal . 
including , the companies urban of housing aboriginal have préconisé of the transfers direct to the companies of housing aboriginal by the through of agreements negotiating and of a body national of coordination . 
this Position is well well and is order to the policy of transfer of the programs to the provinces . 
this kind of arrangement has of the precedents including in the centres of training and of reaction . 
the argumentations against the transfers federal to the provinces are historic , constitutional and profoundly enracinés in the objectives of autodétermination of the Peoples aboriginal . 
they insistent also on the lack of consultation to the regard of these transfers . 
of enemies consultation constitute a principle sir in the evolution of the relations with the Peoples aboriginal and a principle seconded by the Court Supreme of the Canada in of the judgments as the judgment Sparrow . 
he there has also of the reasons of policy and of operating daily to the challenge of the transfers provincial . 
in fact , nothing not proves that the provinces can better administering of the programs that the companies urban of housing aboriginal . 
no assessment independent not the has never revealed not more . 
by against , . knows that of the measures key as the to of the apartment in service of the income of the locataires can be need unilaterally to the grateful of the provinces . 
the Mortgage has tried of ensure to the companies of housing for aboriginal that their interests in their conserving of housing are protected in the agreements of transfer and that they not the in conservation not more difficulty . 
these assurance have been very little convaincantes . 
they believe have the right , well mérité , of take of the decisions they - same . 
if they decision of conclude of the agreements with the provinces or with the authorities local by the the , this will their choice , a choice based on their political and on their programs . 
the question is of know the he must cancel the transfer of the programs aboriginal and negotiate of the agreements of transfer with the companies of housing for aboriginal who the wish or let in place the strategy federal of transfer of the responsibilities to the provinces . 
of very solid arguments have been made in favour of the Alternative , by a model aboriginal , of the model of the needs essential who legislation the uniqueness affordable , the Standards to the needs and the standards of Conformity in the society Canadian . 
for of the reasons evident , this model quoting the also of the security of the family and of the practices cultural . 
he refléterait better the reality aboriginal when he the is of assessment the needs and of develop of the strategies for there answer . 
he would of do to the future of the strategies on the housing for achieve of the objectives that continue already of the companies of housing who not are to little close not scant by the governments . 
in wide these objectives , . " of the gripped to the aboriginal , . will the of the needs of the great - parents and of the seniors , of the practices spirituelles , of the access to the activities cultural , of the programs of the small boyhood and of the services aboriginal regarding the assistance financial and the assistance in the of employment . 
the strategy of housing should be more to same of protect the families of the crime and of the violence which they can be victims to because of their heritage aboriginal . 
the changes made to the Act national on the habitation and to the Act on the Corporation Canadian of Mortgage and of housing , who have received the Assent Royal the 17 June 99 , have given to the Mortgage of the tools more solid for give of the assistance and deal with of the types more many of organizations , if . in believes the testimony of the officials of the Mortgage , who have been heard by the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology the 9 June 99 . said power increased facilitera can - be the transfer of powers real and of a sure control to a new Administration aboriginal of the housing . 
this strategy 1 to the key recommendation that has worded the committee Standing of the Affairs aboriginal in 1992 after of long deliberations and consultation . 
the committee , up of representatives of all the parties , has between other recommended that the funding of the housing aboriginal be administered by the through of a only body which the mandate sell the granting of loans , the insurance , the development of political , the taken of decisions , the management of programs , the research , the training , the development economic and the funding . 
, the over of a recent convention on the housing organized by the Assembly of the Nations Nations , the leaders have préconisé a structure similar for satisfy to the needs of the members of the Nations Nations . 
the new Administration aboriginal of the housing would independent and would the ability of do of the laws for the aboriginal . 
she would also the power of negotiate of the agreements with of the departments federal and that of coordinating or of offer to of the thousands of families of the services of training and of mutual , of the services debates to the development of the young children , of the services of health and of education and of the assistance to the development of the businesses . 
a such strategy would also to the companies of the housing of do more with the resources financial to their clause . 
the difference between the rate créditeur federal and the rate débiteur federal could serve to fund more of houses and to support the research on the best initiatives and the management . 
that would also of develop of new services and products linked to the borrowing mortgage for help the families aboriginal . 
these services could englober the Purchase and the maintenance of local for the students and the care of health , because he would possible of better use the someone 200 million of $ that expenditure the government federal for these local . 
honourable senators , the transfer of these attributions federal can the do without that he be necessary of adopt of new provisions legislation . 
he would probably that the Prime Minister the prévale of the powers that him authority the Act on the restructurations and the transfers of attributions in the Administration public , and that the all be formalizes by of the agreements of transfers done . 
, long term , . could propose and adopt of new provisions legislation to to recognize the existence of authorities local aboriginal in the of housing , authorities which the powers , the duties and the makes on the plan legal would unique . 
these authorities local not will more of the companies without purpose profit and they could create of the businesses and of the jobs in their communities . 
they will the expression of the autodétermination of the aboriginal . 
this is to the legislators that he is now of to in implement a strategy aboriginal overall audacieuse or of simply draft the strategy federal existante . 
the government the before on the serious circumstances that live the families may of the on in the street , or who there are already , there including the families aboriginal . 
we believe that , in the major cities , the system who provides of the services to the without - homeless aboriginal is the key of any strategy to to help these without - homeless and that any injected of money nine should the do to the way of this system . 
the research the of way again that he must develop without delay a strategy and a plan of action for to in implement of the solutions to this problem none . 
given given that Health Canada has said that a home doing was considerations for the health , the problem of the without - homeless require that of the measures be taken as now . 
we must study seriously the recommendations made by the of studies , of investigations and of evidence to of present of the advice precise . 
the recommendations and the plan of action undoubtedly the Minister responsible of the without - homeless . 
this study not must not be reléguée to the oubliettes . 
in as that Canadians and parliamentarians , we must not only answer to this need none , but also develop a plan of action who will to all the families aboriginal the place who their up in the society Canadian . 
the companies of housing for the aboriginal have a expertise . 
they have only need of a opportunity and of a transfer of skills for do their work .

the crisis agricultural current 
the leave of adjourn pursuant to the clause 60 of the Rules to of examine a question high of interest public 
the hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , I rise the speak today today for ask the held of a debate of emergency on the crisis agricultural . 
I believe understand that I must convince His the and that my colleagues of the emergency of the situation . 
I like say of into of stake that the committee Senate Standing of the agriculture and of the Forestry has coast during more of a year and half of the evidence of representatives of button of farmers , primarily those of the west of the Canada . 
these representatives we have entretenus of the problems that they are now . 
I believe that our committee has came a screaming careful to their very , who were serious . 
the first ministers of the Manitoba and of the Saskatchewan the are taller someone little disappointed of the response that they have received to the over of the discussions that they have face recently with the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Finance . 
he there has in the west of the Canada a deep sentiment of reluctance and of despair . 
I not fixed not of figures today today because that . in has already many given in this chamber and that . in has of , spoke yesterday . 
however , the tragedy human who the happened now in the Western is very serious . 
I I spoke yesterday to of the people who the roles of the services of assistance telephone . 
they me have indicated that he there had already had eight suicides . 
the last in date is the of a man , father of four children , who the is suicidé after have been forsaken by the wife to because of the difficult situation in which they the were . 
honourable senators , we are all of the adults responsible . 
this crisis is so serious that she served in question our ability of represent our regions and of assume our responsibilities to the country all world . 
honourable senators , he there has several issues which I like you speak . 
however , I believe that the aspect of the tragedy human is the more important . 
we must start a call to this regard . 
the time press . 
he the is guarantee of a situation of emergency who require that we namely of the measures as now . 
the crisis economic current not one not simply the hailed agricultural . 
she has also of the impact on the certified of machinerie , the manufacturers and the employment in the together . 
each vendeur of machinerie is a small plant . 
. there served to nine the tracteurs and of other believed agricultural . 
when the farmers not have not of money , these businesses are bankrupt and of the people lose their employment . 
the government will their be of the insurance - unemployment . 
he is essential of not not let this situation perdurer , of there which quickly and effectively . 
I like speak of the impact of the crisis in the municipalities rural . 
a approximately of municipalities rural have decided , by vote , of until the levy of the taxes local . 
I I spoke to the chairman of the board City of the pay of Wellington , to the North of Weyburn , in Saskatchewan . It has said that this not is not because that the farmers not want not pay their taxes , but well that they not have not the money for the do . 
the situation has of the impact on any the Saskatchewan in of many sectors . 
honourable senators , I want speak of the impact of this situation on any our nation . 
that not receive not simply the Saskatchewan , the Manitoba and some regions of the Alberta , but all the country . 
of more , that not the happened not simply to the Canada but in the world world , to because of the grants and the rest . 
we know all the reasons . 
in a clause of newspaper , . said that after a behind of nine days , the chairman Clinton has signed a agreed agricultural who for a assistance of emergency to the farmers of 8,7 billion of $ . 
in response to that , the chairman of the committee of the agriculture has said : 
I am happy that the chairman that signed this bill of bill important , same if I not understand not why he has as eighth . 
honourable senators , this is a situation very serious who deserves a debate in this chamber . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the the the Speaker : 
I wish to remind to the honourable senators that the Rules for of the interventions of 5 minutes by senator and 15 minutes of debate to the total . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I rise in as that Leader Deputy of the government to the Senate . 
given given that the decision is multitude to the discretion of His the the Speaker , I will be very prudent in my comments . 
honourable senators , the senator Gustafson we has fact share of the intention of raise the question . 
we the we listened and we are all to fact prepared to let the Speaker the deal to this about pursuant to the Rules . 
I not I not of observation particular to do . 
I would out , however , that we are all well aware of this that the senator Gustafson has said to comments of the business of the committee Senate of the agriculture . 
we are happy of let to the Speaker the be of decide , pursuant to the Rules , the he the is of a question of interest public high . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
it - you in favour or not ? 
the senator Hays : 
I not I not the claim of say to the Speaker what do because that I respect the Rules . 
I believe that the Speaker must take a decision in service of this that he has heard . 
the senator Kinsella : 
not you - you not of opinion ? 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
there has he or not a crisis ? 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , I not I not as of credibility that the senator Gustafson to this about , but I am the daughter of a farmer of the region of the lakes of the Manitoba . 
. here of the crisis agricultural since of the months . 
during this time , the farmers have been acculés to the at of the ripe because that their marges of profit the are resserrées . 
the costs échappent to the control of the farmers . 
the price are under by the markets international and they échappent also to their control . 
the competition is impossible to because of the grants paid by the Union European and the States - United . 
same if the farmers can be on the income of a or two jobs to the outside of the firm , they are jobs debt and now the bankrupt . 
they could losing their land , their heritage , their source of income and the way of life which they are profoundly attachment . 
honourable senators , the tragedies personal not are not always the subject of emergency national , but I will list few reasons who follows why the crisis is high to the point of justify a debate of emergency . 
of first , the week last , of the producers agricultural and the first ministers of the Manitoba and of the Saskatchewan are came to Ottawa for ask the assistance of the government federal . 
they knew that he was essential that the producers receive of other Payments of here December for avoid the bankrupt before the spring . 
as we the know , the government has refused of injected of new are of money and the Banking will now forced of proceed to of the saisies . 
second , the Program of assistance in case of disaster linked to the income agricultural , who was fill a deficiency in the programs existing of security of the income agricultural , is a disaster . 
, the Manitoba , more of 55p. per of the farmers which the ask has been handled until to present not have received no assistance . 
third , the impact of the crisis agricultural is severe not only by the hailed agricultural family , but also by almost all the world in community rural . 
the people not can pay their bills . 
they promise least of believed agricultural . 
the écoliers use their accommodation school of the year before . 
almost all the world must the serrer the tightening , rogner on all and needless . 
fourth , the level of stress increase quickly home the farmers and their families and in the communities rural . 
he enough of read the letters way by of the children to the Prime Minister for see to what point the parents are their stressés . 
the issues have been clarifiés and the crisis has been implementation in light during of meetings that I I face here and to the Manitoba with of the delegations of farmers désespérés . 
he we have been very grateful of the have heard here , to the Senate . 
they are angry " and unfriendly by of the forces who échappent completely to their control . 
how can - we , to the Senate , look the situation the eroded more without give a attention appropriate to their concerns in the framework of a debate of emergency ? 
the hon. Ron Ghitter : 
honourable senators , I rise for encourage the Speaker to allow the held of a debate of emergency on this about . 
in as that citadin , I me sense many more to the comfortable the feet on the asphalte that on the land , but I contemplated the importance of our world agricultural of the point of view of someone a who has been a representative elected in Alberta during eight years and of the point of view of a senator who has met to again occasions of the people derogate of the world agricultural . 
, the over of the years , I allowed in blaguant my friends farmers of " pleurnichards " , and of people who not are never murmur . 
this is be the bad time , be the price of the Wheat , be the amount of the grants , or still the over of the dollar when they will in making to the sun . 
end August , the senator Gustafson me has guest to a meeting to Ottawa with a group of farmers of the Saskatchewan and of the Alberta . 
several of my colleagues were that also . 
we we spoke of this that the farmers Ouje . 
this not were not of the people who parlaient senior and very and who cooperate to draw the attention . 
when I the I regardés in the " , I I seen the afraid . 
when I the I trusting , I could hear in their Senators of the trémolos trahissant the tears that they pin of clerical . 
when I I thought to this that they had to say , I am became very " , not only for them , but also for the people agricultural of the Canada . 
I I examined this that they had to say , and that this that the senators Spivak and Gustafson me had said . 
then , when I I at the graphique who stated that the income agricultural net chosen , expressed in $ terms of 1998 , was past of 8,700 million of $ that he was of 1993 to 1997 , to 400 million of $ in 1998 , to least 48 million of $ in 99 , I I including this which they parlaient . 
we not we ourselves not before a situation where of the people come clamour a little more of assistance to the government . 
this are of the people who are to the on of the gulf . 
their survival is in are of the play . 
. could the amuser with the figures during still long , but the fact is that the situation is high in the regions rural of the Canada . 
in the Western , she is of more in more high ; the figures are effarants . 
this is all a way of life who is attack in the west of the Canada , Honour the . 
from of the Manitoba , you know this that that to say . 
the communities rural , the control of the resources agricultural , the cost of the foods and the survival of thousands of Canadians are in stake . 
I note , by example , that the senator Hays has should accept a new employment . 
the income agricultural has so decreased that he has agreed the position of Leader Deputy to the Senate . 
as . the has said , the Divestiture of the Western ... 
the the the Speaker : 
I regret of duty interrupt the hon. senator Ghitter , but the period of 15 minutes has expired . 
however , he can continue the he getting the Authorized . 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the the the Speaker : 
please continue . 
the senator Ghitter : 
the week last , the Prime Minister Romanow and the Prime Minister Doer were to the head of a delegation , to Ottawa , for ask to the government federal a assistance of 1.3 billion of $ for the farmers . 
the farmers of the Western , who believed that a assistance immediate would , fondaient of great hopes on the meetings . 
however , their hopes have been disappointed . 
the delegation is repartie the hands vides , except that . him has presented a new series of figures . 
I think that the incident has underlined the emergency of the situation , to know that the farmers of the Western want solve the crisis the week last . 
she not has not been résolue , and we , senators , must now the examine of any emergency for come immediately in assistance to the farmers of the Western . 
if we we more long , he will can - be too later .

the Defence national 
the restructuring of the units of contingency of the Canada Atlantic - - 1 Canadian of Turkey of campaign of the Artillerie Royal Canadian 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I I a question to question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
that back to a discussion that I I had with the predecessor to the about of the restructuring of the units of contingency to the Canada . 
some units are Answers as the which , and of other as the not which . 
without too impediment the things , he not there has not of doubt in my spirit that I I been seriously detrimentally in mistake . 
I I chosen of add faith to that because that three or four people different were in are of answer to the ask of information . 
that respect the 1 regiment of campaign of the Artillerie Royal Canadian , which the Headquarters General the find to Halifax . 
this is a unity that the Minister knows very well and which he is without doubt enough proud in as that Scotians - Scotians . 
. has recognized to this unity a level of troop in activity of 93,1p. per and a rate of efficiency of 88,5p. per . 
. the to the least 15 units of contingency to the Canada who are qualifiées of not which . 
however , no of between they not has a matter similar . 
that has brought any a brouille between the apparatus of the contingency to the Canada and the government present , for of the reasons as those - this , I i . 
I believe that this unity deserves of the apologize . 
I think that the human any pantheon for do these apologize is none other that the Minister responsible of the Nova - Nova . 
I not ask not of the negotiations extensive to this regard , but of simple apologize for the mistake , little any how she has been commise . 
the Minister can - he ask a reassessment of the rating granted to this unity historic of the Nova - Nova to the over of the process of reassessment ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , to my knowledge , the government has always seconded the role important that role the contingency in all the country . 
I know that , in my region , we will to a given for two biographies facilities to Sydney , in Nova - Nova , who future to the contingency . 
I believe know that these facilities improve far the operating of the contingency in the region . 
the unity to which the hon. senator fact referring , the 1 regiment of campaign of the Artillerie Royal Canadian , is a unity remarkable which all the Scotians - Scotians can be proud . 
I him ask of do evidence of a little of patience , the time that I me seek with of the Minister to this about . 
I hope power provide to the senator Forrestall a response specific to his question . 
the senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , far of me the idea of speak to the behalf of the regiment . 
of a other side , the Lieutenant - Colonel Doyle has left hear , in the comments that he has facts he there has few months , that to the notice , the least that can do the CFT for already the situation would of the apologize . 
this unity is viable and should be rétablie . 
this is can - be the a of the units the more which to the Canada .

honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
the week last , I I attended to a conference who had place to Ottawa . 
I I found during of this event that the government of the Canada had failed miserably for this who is of open the service public to the minorities visible . 
according the last report on the equity in the employment , only 9 200 of the 190 $ officials federal the say them - same members of minorities visible . 
that represents about 5 per , be least of the half of the 11 per that the minorities visible are to the within of the people Canadian . 
, the Senate , according the last statistics that I I could obtain , 1,2p. per of the employees are members of minorities visible .

however , he there has of the warning encouraged . 
of the statistics recent that I not I not in with indicate that the members of the minorities visible seem obtain of the promotions in of the risen correspondent to their percentage to the within of the service public . 
this is well , but the situation not is not fully satisfactorily . 
the figures seem when same indication a improvement . 
course , we seek always to achieve our objective , who is a representation to the within of the service public and of the Senate who reflects the percentage that are the minorities visible in the people in General .

I me undertake to provide these information to the senator . 
for this who is of the Senate , the question could interest to fair as the committee Standing of the Economy Economy , of the Budgets and of the Administration .

the Finance 
the dévaluation of the dollar - - influence on the Purchase of companies Canadian by of the interests foreign 
the hon. Gerry Germain : 
he there has had a é the to the sales of MacMillan Bloedel , company Canadian established of long date , to Weyerhaeuser , great conglomérat American who has advantage of this that a great number of between we our be a way situation of the share of the government of manage our system tax and Monetary in leaving the dollar Canadian be also dévalué that he the is to the time current . 
this morning , I I fact the trajet since Toronto with a young man who has always been a Liberal , but who is all to fact disgusted of see all these businesses be achetées by of the Americans and of other , virtually to half price . 
the Minister has he of the comments to forward relatively to the fact that these major companies Canadian the are offset by of the businesses foreign ? 
I not say not that he must return to the terrible Agency of review of the Investment abroad implementation on at by the government Liberal Mr. Trudeau , but I think that he there has a problem when . loses of major companies as MacMillan Bloedel . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the comments of the hon. senator me interested criticized . 
of any obviously , the value of our vowels creates a dynamic economic who can lead various consequences or various events , according the circumstances . 
I am surprised of learn that , in General , the representatives of the sector of the resources natural the opposed to the scenario of the dollar Canadian . 
I would thought that , in well of the case , that their offrirait a advantage extraordinary when just the time of sell their products across in the world . 
I not am not expert of the industry of the lumber of sciage , but I know that , in of many branches of the sector of the resources natural , the scenario of the dollar Canadian has offered of great benefits to our producers , this who has same contributed to create of the jobs and to stimulate the activity economic . 
the scenario of the dollar Canadian has therefore had , of the least to some ways , of the impact positive on the sector of the resources natural . 
this that he must clerical , by against , this is that the scenario of the dollar makes the acquisition of companies Canadian very most to those who hold of the $ American and who liquidity of such iceberg more interesting that other . 
he not must particularly not forget that our vowels is flottante and that she find she - same the own level . 
this will of , always the case , to least that we not we loans to its in full the policy of the Bank of the Canada . 
in this who respect the iceberg by of the interests foreign , he there can - be of other solutions that the Agency of review of the Investment abroad . 
the hon. senator in has can - be same some to we propose . 
the St. Germain : 
honourable senators , the Leader about of the scenario of the dollar Canadian and of the sector resource . 
this is really a false economy because , in some case , that we has led to become least competitive . 
that has led to these were quota fallacious on the lumber of implement , who have set a real nightmare . 
that has CRTC the development of any industry in a province , because without Quotas , . not can open a scierie . 
that system a series of problems to this about . 
this is really prosecutors . 
honourable senators , I believe that , in the framework of solutions to short term , the government has used the rate of interest to a level too there and this is this who has led to the dévaluation of this dollar flottant . 
in as that special , our foreign by report to the rest of the world has been reduced . 
, the airport Heathrow , he in costs 15 books for a small - at , this who represents , except mistake , 45 $ Canadian about . 
that mine completely our ability of stay competitive individually on the market world . 
the senator Taylor : 
this Mr. Mulroney who has began all that . 
the St. Germain : 
listen , you you had your opportunity . 
you operate you mothballing of the GST and of all these other measures and you not in you nothing fact , Mr. . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I the say with , I not am not of agreed with my hon. colleague on a sure number of points . 
the St. Germain : 
I hope that this is the case . 
the senator Boudreau : 
some of these difference touch same the vowels . 
for my share , I not am not in favour of that . 
when . is against a rate of change fixed and the keeping artificial of the dollar Canadian to a level more high by report to the dollar American , he must then create of the conditions who will to the Proceed of the value of our dollar . 
I like that the hon. senator far that I am favourable to a rate of change flottant . 
I find that this is a good way of correct the situation for the two major economies , the States - United and the Canada , who can and the us the a to the other . 
I rest in favour of a rate of change flottant and , must - I add , I not so not to me decide to prôner a increase of the rate of interest . 
I not can not be of agreed with the hon. senator , who is of notice that this is good for the country of abolish the rate of interest . 
I not can all simply not the admit . 
well of the people of the industry of the resources natural with which I me am ago have nothing party of a dollar Canadian low . 
however , with a rate of change flottant , the dollar Canadian finit by find the level who is the fun . 
, least that we not we loans to adopt a sure number of measures Draconian , a rate of change with or a increase of the rate of interest by example , the dollar Canadian continue of find the own level . 
I not be not prepared to me deal in favour of rate of interest notablement more high . 
I not know not if the senators of in opposite there are supportive , but I not believe not that our party there be favourable .

I I taken happy to hear that , for keep and draw the best and the more brilliant of our fellow , we must do evidence of a spirit of imagination novateur . 
the cooperation between the governments , the universities , the institutions of research and the sector private is essential if we want stay to the before - Custody of the competition World . 
he is therefore appropriate that the government the move of increase the support to the research by the through of our various agencies granting which the Council of research medical , the Council of research in Science human and the Council of research in Science natural and in mention . 
the proposal of create in all the Canada 2 $ new chaires of excellence in research is a initiative before - gardiste , all as of , the bill of create the Institute Canadian of research in health . 
in the response of the Prime Minister to the speech of the Throne , he there has a a who nutshell very well the efforts of the government for promote the research . 
he worth the only of be repeatedly : 
honourable senators , in showing a strategy who intègre the economy , the policy social and the Environment , the government recognizes also that , also well define that be his questions and his programs , they not can be effective without the sector private . 
this is the sector private who is the drives of the economy . 
the government can offer the tools , but this are the making of the businesses who are operate the equipment and who produced the property and services who must be sold here and to the abroad . 
we we all heard speak of the claimed drain of the drain . 
in showing his vision of the future , the government has met the conditions winners for keep and draw the best researchers , the best commensurate , the best producers and the best commercialistes to the world . 
as they come of all the regions of the chorus , who of other could better we help to do competition to the country foreign ? 
as I I chaired a under - committee who has presented his findings to the Senate in June , I am outset that the Canada is in legislation of support the competition in the sectors in evolution of the ordinatique . 
this objective , that the Prime Minister has guest the sector private to achieve , represents a issue of 200 billion of $ for the businesses . 
we we a vision of the Canada . 
this vision is the of a society modern , who the is bâtie through to the sharing of experience and of values , of a society who is outcome of a determination to intolerance against the statehood , to any the excellence , of a society who fact the envy of the other . 
honourable senators , is this that is the Canada , our Canada , the of today today and of tomorrow . 
the hon. Erminie J . Cohen : 
honourable senators , the speech of the Throne gravity the program of the government for the new millennium and we did a plan and a list of priorities who 18.7 that the children will to the before - scene in the Budgets to come . 
we see , between other , a together of programs reasonable for the children , a increase of the Estimates and of the benefits accorded to the families poor and to their children , a break of motherhood paid , of the housing for the without - homeless and a Program of action national for the children . 
is of the reasons valid and sensées for the government of Engage of the Estimates during that he are a surplus . 
in fact , this are of the objectives laudable . 
however , what is the date target ? 
what programs are Softwood for to end to the poverty of the children and when will - we in place a strategy national ? 
well that the Canadians to including the need of increase the Estimates to the as of the programs social have appreciate the speech of the Throne , they have however been disappointed that the government that out of propose a plan of action for help the more those . 
that comptons - we do for relieve the difficulties of the Canadians who have been private of their rights ? 
the fight against the poverty to the Canada what by the perseverance , the determination , the commitment , the compassion and the actions concrete . 
hélas , the 12 October last , the government not we has served that a list of priorities . 
he must that the Canadians and the Canadians of tomorrow so say , in considering the present Parliament , that he the counsellors of men and of women profoundly to build a Canada more very and a better quality of life for their children and their grandchildren - children . 
in my quality of Chairman of the group of work of the Party Progressive - Conservative on the poverty , I me am entretenue with many of individuals and of advocates of the poor of a across to the other of the country . 
their testimony dénonce the burden enormous of the poverty , also well for the individuals that for the society . 
many of people have indicated that the programs of fight against the poverty not will not that improve the situation of the earner - small of today today , but they strengthen also the prospects socioéconomiques future of the Canada . 
this are that two elements inseparable , honourable senators . 
a good policy economic system inevitably a good policy social . 
the a not will not without the other . 
he not is not vital of remind to the senators that the poverty to the Canada has reached of the risen surviving . 
not we about . not without tirelessly of the million of grandchildren Canadians who live under the below of the poverty ? 
the Winter the soon to our doors , the families are of more in more many to duty the atteler to the painful task of seek a housing . 
the speech of the Throne not has spent that a half - line to the without - homeless . 
by much , the 26 October , the daily Ottawa Citizen has released a clause inspired on Catherine Luxton , a fillette employees years who has taken conscience of the new magnitude of the problem of the itinérance . 
she has decided , with the assistance of the father , of do someone something for help the nécessiteux . 
the Luxton the are set a objective . 
he will to of the funds for buy 50 $ meals chauds to distribute to the without - homeless of the region of Ottawa . 
as he is comforting of see a young daughter recognize a need pressing in our society and decide of do someone something immediately for which to the situation . 
why the government the - he if long before of in do as ? 
of the thousands of Canadians live in the parks , under the bridges , in the streets . 
this are the citizens overlooked of our society . 
the problem of the without - homeless is a problem real and serious which too of Canadians are face today today ; this is a problem which I hoping that the government with length in the speech of the Throne . 
mother Teresa we has the in Custody when she has said : 
we properly considered , you and me , in service of this that we do for the poor . 
now that the budget is excédentaire , I hope that the government in contained for the deal seriously to the problem pressing and none of the poverty to the Canada before that come for him the time of the judgment last . 
the vision being in the speech of the Throne has statement the direction that the government does take in the year who just . 
I commend the government of have had the prévoyance of recognize that a Investment in the first years of our children is a Investment in the future of our country . 
however , for rompre the graduate of the poverty , he must give to all the children to the Canada a opportunity equal of wasn all their potential . 
he is sad of see that they not in have not the possible today today . 
if we could which with success to the conditions Social who perpétuent the poverty é , honourable senators , we could rise a new generation of children - of the children which the needs essential are comblés for that they so become of the members of the society Canadian in good health , self and educated . 
the Prime Minister has said : 
we must to also quickly that possible of the words to the actions . 
these words not want nothing say , the the of the fact that in 1989 , a resolution to to eliminate the poverty home the children before the year 2000 has been agreed by all the parties to the other place . 
honourable senators , ten years have past and he is yet bashful of see that the government has fact well little for esteem the grandchildren Canadians , which a on five has the much rhetoric . 
, legislation that the poverty the répand to the Canada , this promise in the air of the government it least of hope . 
the government has promised of new investment in the Prestation national for children , but since he there has a surplus today today , why is - he to tomorrow for take of the measures ? 
when he has met the poor across to the Canada , the group of work on the poverty of the caucus national of the Party Progressive - Conservative has often and clear heard say that the time is come for the government federal of réindexer the Prestation national for children to the rate of inflation . 
, the over of the last session , the member Progressive - Conservative of Shefford , to the Quebec , has presented a motion of the same kind to the other place . 
the government Liberal has revealed that he entendait spend a billion of $ for expand the break of motherhood and the to of six months to a year . 
I me am of this initiative and of the prévoyance that has the government in grateful that he is important that the parents just of the time with their children during the first years of training . 
however , when . there taking to two time , . the ask who to the fair will of this grant . 
the the of the changes s on the market of the work , he there has many of workers contractual and self . 
however , these people not are not part of the regime of insurance - employment . 
of more , this legislation not fact nothing for help those who are excluded of the market of the work up . 
she not does not to the needs of the women to low income who not will not benefit of a break of motherhood if their earnings not earner not of money . 
that in is - he of the Leader of a family monoparentale who not can be that on him - same or she - same ? 
I believe power say that this not is not the question of the break of motherhood who concern the unemployed Canadian , but well the who is to find the ways of to of the their on the table . 
the Nations overseeing have said that the Canada was the better country to the world for live . 
yet , 5.2 million of Canadians live under the below of the poverty . 
the 12 October last , the Canadians had need that . their revealing a plan showing of the solutions concrete to of eliminate the poverty , the number of the without - homeless and the need of have of the Banking of foods . 
unfortunately , they have heard of waves promises who would conducted in a deadline approximatif . 
, the enter of the st century , I implore the government of adopt a Position courageuse and audacieuse , of do a effort concerté and of the Engage to abolish the level of life to of do of the vision being in the speech of the Throne a reality for the those . 
I the implore of reduce the gap between the off and the poor , of majorer the Benefit tax for child , of abolish the below of assujettissement to the tax , of réindexer the tax on the income of the special for protect the gains of the inflation and of improve the program of insurance - employment for that all those who in have need receive of the benefits , this who reduce the insécurité financial of the Canadians to the taken with the new market of the work . 
the government has for duty of ensure a level of life décent to all his citizens . 
Tagore , a poet indien , has wrote : 
I I Fee and I I rêvé that the life was wear , I me am coined and I I seen that the life was duty , I I acted and I I found that the duty was wear , I wish to the government of know the wear ! 
the hon. Gerald J . Comeau : 
honourable senators , to the about of the decision any recent of the Court Supreme of the Canada , the 17 September 99 , five judges of the Court Supreme of the Canada , in call of the Court of call of Nova - Nova , have administering that in under of rights derogate of treated who have been signésle 10 March 1760 , Donald Marshall not was not the of the conform to the regulatory on the fisheries . 
I like draw your attention on of the considerations and a context historic who not have not been taken in consideration by the Court Supreme and who indicate that the treaty of 1760 not is not unfortunate . 
in consequential , the court should to on his decision . 
let - me of quote a addressed mémorable of this judgment . 
he not cannot ask least of the honour and of the dignity of the Crown in his reports with the Nations Nations . 
pareils feelings collecting a héroïsme chevaleresque , of the he of basic officers and of generous officials . 
the judges could can - be ask that a every in memory of the Governor Lawrence , signatory of the document of 1760 , be secured on the pelouses before the Court Supreme for that they not politicking never the negative of their decision . 
however , five years to only before of sign this document now immortalized , the Governor Acting Lawrence agreement , the 11 August 1755 , a other document giving of the instructions to the Colonel John Winslow . 
for occurrences and arrangement the people , you someday have point to the ways the more are and , according the circumstances , you serve of the ruse or of the force . 
I wishes particularly that you teniez no the of the supplications and of the Petitions that you adresseront the people , what that be those who wish stay . 
a be ignoble , gorgé of the authority military , who , smuggled and of his own initiative and without the leave of his senior , has given the order of stop , of have and of déporter 15 $ men , women and children , which the half has canoe during the déportation . 
this is the same man who has signed the treaty of 1760 . 
réfléchissons a little to the magnitude of the fault . 
the order transgressait openly the clause 29 of the Britain Charter of England . 
he enfreignait the Pétition of rights of 1628 . 
absolutely nothing not allows of believe that the effect acadiennes remettaient in question the regime British . 
in assuming that some Acadians have made of the barristers political , he not there no bill British or other Motion the punish of their women and of their children . 
nothing , if this not is a order of the Parliament , not could as a about British of the country , same the he the was of a criminal . 
the treaty of Utrecht of 1713 , and the ascertain of the Queen Anne du23 June 1713 , have expanded the protection cheap by the treaty . 
they stipulent that the Acadians have of the rights on their Lands and that they not can be expelled to least of a sentence made by a court . 
that a member of the executive , who was a simple Lieutenant - Governor , that répudié a prerogative Royal contrevenait to the right British basic of the time . 
in 1729 , the Governor Richard Phillips had assured the Acadians by wrote of his protection against such actions . 
the Colonel Lawrence has acted without receive of levels and has méprisé all the laws who protected the Acadians . 
same the king not had not the power of sign a order of déportation , because the provisions of 1297 of the Britain Charter of England stipulent that the king not is not beyond - that of the bill , therefore still least a simple Lieutenant - Governor Acting . 
this colourful has fact confisquer the property of the Acadians , brûler their houses and their ways , abattre their are . 
he has violating of the families that he has they on of the ships fragiles for be in as esclaves or condamnées to the servitude in the colonies U.S. . 
memories that this déportation criminal and these sides of does were entamés when the treaty of 1760 has been signed and extensions until in 1763 . 
the labourers judges we themselves that they présument that Lawrence has acted honorablement in preparing this treaty of 1760 . 
is the at of a bureaucrate powerful which the duty professional was of protect the Acadians . 
of the at who shows that he not had no respect or for the treated or for the day British . 
of the decisions as those - that have always been fallacious , that this be in time of peace or of War . 
Lawrence has asked of the actions deplores and fallacious , same to the aune of the moral of the Eighteenth century . 
of the actions as those - that were inadmissibles in the past and they the are all as today today . 
a criminal not should not have the right of create of the laws fundamental in a society civilisée . 
the may reprehensible the has private of all right legal and moral of sign not any what document which . the réfère today today for guide our civilization modern . 
in benchmark our laws on a reference to Lawrence , . the moque of the memory of our basic Canadians and Canadians , of our martyrs who have fought and paid their blood for that same the behaviours murderers of people as Lawrence . 
they have paid their blood for that of the tyrans of this resources not Sidney not on we and not do not the bill to the forefront of their fusil . 
and is that to the enter of the new millennium , we will immortaliser formally the heritage of Lawrence in the kit of the court Supreme of the country . 
what Blasphemy of the memory of our martyrs and of our ancestors visited , the first Europeans to the establish to the Canada ! 
we let a terrible heritage to the generations montantes . 
some people say that I in want to the day British . 
they the trompent , I in want to the at of a psychotique brings , of a bureaucrate écoeurant . 
I think that the most of the Acadians think as me and that this patient developmentally to lier was of the own Leader . 
we know all that Lawrence not is not the Prime bureaucrate of the history to exorbitant of the authority and to approach to of the actions of through , of violence and of terrorism . 
unfortunately , he not will not the last not more . 
I urge the judges to reflect to the implications of their reaching . 
if the . accept the would of the document of 1760 , . i that he has exécuté his duties general and ordinary with the Authorized of the day and of the people British . 
he the obviously that he had of the ; of déporter the Acadians and that he has faithfully obéi to the volontés of the day . 
in grateful the power legal of Lawrence of sign of the documents legal to the behalf of the day , the Court Supreme recognizes the would of the order of déportation . 
during of the centuries , the day has balayé this illégalité under the been . 
this is can - be for that that the order of déportation not has never been withdrawn and that all the world can in take knowledge . 
this is can - be for that that the Acadians have been wording excluded of the treaty of Paris of 1763 , and that this bannissement illegality is always in the books . 
the cancellation of the order could involved that the act has been indeed asked . 
the démenti of atrocities has a long history . 
he is well possible that he there that had of the abuse made by of the bureaucrats British to the over of the long history of the colonisation , but never intentionnellement of this magnitude . 
I not believe not that the day that never agreed the actions cruel ill to the Acadians . 
in fact , I like you read a letter that I I sent to the consul General of the Britain - Britain to Houston , the 18 October 1994 , who demonstrates that this not is not a about that I raises for the first time today today . 
I will you read this letter such that I the I written : 
I I followed of close the developments debates to the petition Mr. Buffet Perrin regarding the expulsion , in 1755 , of the Acadians of the Nova - Nova . 
Mr. . Perrin ask persuading one for the great tragedy that have well the Acadians . 
this were of the issues British who had right to the protection of the state . 
the treaty of Utrecht of 1713 has yielding the Acadie to the Britain - Britain . 
the community é was well established in Nova - Nova since more of a century when this act occasional has been made . 
unfortunately , the government British not has never recognized the illégalité of the expulsion seeing in the behalf by his representatives colonialists , which the key responsibility was of protect the issues and the property British . 
the time who has past not much nothing to the serious of this act . 
the perpétration of this act entache angry the history of the democracy of the Britain - Britain , which this last is if proud . 
I am sure that the majority of the Britanniques approuveraient the principle universal that he not there not of deadline of prescription for the crimes against the humanity , particularly when the members of the state caregiver of the crimes to the issues of their country ... 
in as that Parliamentary , I am aware of the importance of recognize the mistakes of the past of way to this that they not the occur never . 
the expulsion of the Acadians has been a act barbare who has taken of the risen great . 
goes has been a prospect ethnic bashful and criminal ... 
the government British has here the opportunity of do to the people of the world world a statement constructive to the the Universal . 
the prospect ethnic , the genocide and the violence to the citizens of a country are fallacious . 
he the can that that take of the centuries , but the justice the emportera always . 
some say that I not sympathise not opposite to the problems vécus by the Canadians aboriginal . 
, the contrary , the Acadians and the aboriginal have been of the friends as the beginning of the colonies . 
they have lived and worked together in the harmony and many of between them the mariaient the each to the other . 
during the déportation , the history the that the aboriginal are came to the lot of the refugees visited in aware of great risk . 
I not I no ranc9ur to the place of the only allies of my ancestors . 
a great number of aboriginal are also victims of the actions of those of Lawrence . 
in 1756 , Lawrence commanda that of the hostilities be took to the Indian , appearing of the money cash for of the prisoners or of the " scalps " : men , women and children . 
they were to the aware of the practices of épuration ethnic long by Lawrence against the Acadians . 
they have seen of first with this that Lawrence réservait to those who osaient the contrarier . 
the judges of the Court Supreme not could surely not imagine that a bureaucrate would if little civilized . 
in a world civilized , a bureaucrate respectueux of the bill would could accomplish this that the judges want read in the document , but he not in was not and of Lawrence . 
the intention of the judges was commendable , but difficulty typifies . 
the judges not must not think that the Parliament is out of respect the citizens . 
the democracy is a treasury win of high fight and she deserves the opportunity of be implemented . 
the judges should think to help to the place of take of the decisions who create of the ressentiments , of the disservice and of the factionalism . 
they not have not thought to the consequences that their interpretation will in our villages inshore and on the and of our resources limited of the sea and of the land . 
the judgment of the Court Supreme has already divided of the effect who have always lived in the harmony and the respect mutuels . 
without pilot , the allow , the jealousy , the greed and the racism are of the forces angry power to unable . 
many of questions are raised but we receiving little of answers . 
the lawyers must already the frotter the hands of satisfaction . 
Lawrence would of what be proud . 
the purpose of my intervention today today not is not of me apitoyer on the malheurs of the past . 
that would for effect of create a mentality of victim who engendrerait of the feelings of infériorité , of acrimony and of indifference . 
of other share , that not sounds not to the mentality of the Acadians , well to the contrary . 
you direz can - be that he is time that the Acadians , some the mentionnent , pardonnent . 
forgive , yes , this is the something to do . 
forget ? 
never . 
those who politicking are were to repeat the mistakes of the past . 
the community international starts all fair to discuss of the possible of create a court criminal international permanent for lower in justice the people guilty of crimes against the humanity . 
I you quote a addressed of the speech that the hon. Lloyd Axworthy has given to the Nations overseeing , the 24 September 99 , who shows clear that we répétons the mistakes of the past , and I quote : 
he we must absolutely create of the mechanisms for that the people who contravenes to the laws international be held responsible of their actions . 
he must parent the culture of the impunité . 
the possible of be pursued and of be than must be a reality for the people who recourent to the violence . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , the time who was Allocation to the senator Comeau is expired . 
the leave is - she granted to the senator Comeau of continue the intervention ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Comeau : 
a genocide cultural not the little not and the agresseur not is never dignified of honour . 
the time not efface not the difficulty or the at of Lawrence . 
he is to a group of monstres that we not must never vénérer . 
he not must never that the behalf be réhabilité . 
who would the following ? 
not will - they not point that the preventative of Lawrence which the the to their own preventative ? 
I ask therefore to the Court Supreme of until the judgment Marshall in pending the held of a inquiry in good and properly form on the would of the signing of Lawrence on someone document that this be . 
the bill not require she not of support the honour and the integrity of the Crown ? 
in fact , the judges could the référer to a petition for the institution of a inquiry , tabled by the Acadians in 1760 . 
Notez well the date of the petition ! 
this inquiry has the caduque any bill of prescription who could ceased . 
the Acadians not deserve - they not of be défendus or of be considered as of the guilty of the méfait who has in their déportation by Lawrence ? 
if Lawrence has always acted in the right and with the boon of the Crown , the history will then written . 
other , Lawrence should be court historically , as he the deserves . 
some will been of the revers of the with my ask of inquiry in alléguant that this is a symbolisme not relevant of a time up . 
I their contend that he not there has not more poised that our commitment to the Crown , to the Gouverneure general and to the robes Red of the judges of our Court Supreme . 
( on the motion of the senator Hays , to the behalf of the senator Finestone , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the Adresse in response - Motion Honourable to to end to the debate the eighteenth day of sitting - Adjourned of the debate 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) , pursuant to the notice of the 2 November 99 , move : 
that the deliberations to the order of the day for the resuming of the debate on the motion Honourable to the Adopted of a Adresse in response to the speech of the Throne , given by His Excellency the Gouverneure general before the two Houses of the Parliament , the remission the eighteenth day of sitting where the order will been debated . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , in trying of understand the why of this motion , I not I could me prevent of think that , if the government to limit - to eight , for be precise - the number of days of debate on the speech of the Throne , this is that he has enormous of difficulty to there find the for that the honourable senators involved to this debate . 
if this not is not the reason , then can - be that the - he to someone other consideration . 
let how the along our business . 
I recognize that few senators have already taken share to the debate , and the interventions are limited to 15 minutes each . 
four senators could therefore take the speak each day . 
, reason of two p.m. by day , this would a safeguarded of eight senators . 
, the pace of two p.m. by day , this that I not I not seen since the beginning of the session , that would a total of 16 p.m. . 
according this scenario , only 32 senators could comment this who must be , of the point of view of the government , the great bill overall of the session . 
least of the third of the members of the Senate could therefore participate to the debate on this great vision that the government is supposed have of the Affairs of the Canada . 
honourable senators , he we must try of see beyond - beyond of this motion who parliament to limit the debate . 
we should always we question seriously on the control of the debates what that be the question to the study . 
how of time the senators of the party first do - they the licensing of time , who is a way of limit the debate ? 
the hon. John B . Stewart : 
the speech are limited adjourn minutes . 
not the oubliez not . 
the senator Kinsella : 
this limit proves s that he must examine the impact of the limit of eight days put for the debate in response to the speech of the Throne . 
the senator Stewart the recall without doubt of the words of the great writer Joseph Joubert , who has said : : 
he worth better debate of a question without the deal that of the deal without the have debated . 
in these documents , of the senior whom of the community of the Affairs of the Canada unleashing of to this question during the been , during the break Parliamentary , of manner to this that she not raises not a important debate . 
I think that our democracy Parliamentary , to the within of a regime bicameral who has resisted to the when of the time and who is in place since 131 years , has been a extraordinary success , what that in say some leaders of parties of the other place . 
. has has , with many of success , the freedom in our country . 
I a all those who in win to the challenge of find in the world a region , a country or a regime government where the freedom , the democracy and the rights of the human have been as respected . 
honourable senators , I believe that we must all to the resist of limit the debate of someone way that this be , as . attempts of the do now . 
by therefore , I move , with the support of the senator DeWare , that the motion not be not agreed now , but that she be amended by the deleting of the word " eight " and the Alternative by the word " fourteenth " . 
the the the Speaker : 
you pleasure - he , honourable senators , of adopt the motion of amendment of the senator Kinsella ?

please hear our supplications before that he not be too later ! 
honourable senators , I I debated my pleas . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I am very happy of power discuss and debate of the question . 
as this is a real source of concern , I thank the senator of we give the opportunity of in speak . 
I will begin by try of balance a little the debate that we will hear today today . 
I commend my colleague of the cabinet , the Minister of the Agriculture and of the Agroalimentaire , of the interest and of the commitment to the regard of a approach national Joint to adopt in reaction to the problems financial who confronting certainly the farmers , in particular in the provinces of the Prairies . 
I say that these problems confronting " some farmers " because - and I me hasten of the add - the sector agricultural remains in the together very very and robuste . 
in General , the income are very close of the trends to long term and the exports of products agri are to the increase . 
( 1610 ) 
we we leapt the year last more of 22 billion of $ of products agricultural and food . 
taken separately , the challenges that the farmers have had to and to the over of the last year not are not unique . 
the over of the products of basic , the costs , the markets international , the economy and the conditions go fluctueront always , sometimes to the so . 
this time - this , however , our farmers have should any of the combinaisons particularly difficult : of the price low for their products and of the costs of production high ; a reduction of the ask of the major markets and a increase of the offer World of products key ; of the conditions go least that ideal and of the floods or of the sécheresses . 
under the direction of the government federal , the representatives of the governments and of the farmers have sought together a solution to a problem who is of as more delicate that he not is not brutes in all the country . 
the nature and the intensité of the - this vary according the regions and the products Alimentarius . 
find a solution Universal becomes therefore almost a pain - head . 
of the measures have however been taken to this regard . 
the Minister of the Agriculture has worked in close cooperation with the provinces and the territories to of improve the program of protection of the income agricultural in which the two levels of government investiront , together , not least of a billion of $ by year . 
the government has looked the basis of the reforms to long term who will of improve , with the time , the ability of the producers of the adapt to the crisis of the income , and who we undoubtedly also to do opposite effectively to the future time . 
in July last , by example , the Minister of the Agriculture and his Provincial of the provinces and territories have began to parse a sure number of problems regarding the development of a program of assistance to more long term in case of disaster linked to the income agricultural . 
in the framework of the discussions , . has underlined the need of ensure to this that the program to long term works effectively with the CSRN , the insurance - crop and the programs supplementary special to each province who make the system of protection of the income agricultural . 
in August and in September , to the opportunity of meetings denies of the country exporters of substantially agricultural , the Minister of the Agriculture has also undertaken a combat to that the system commercial international génère of the income senior for the farmers Canadian . 
he the is of the battle coincide for of the rules of the stake field . 
the Minister has presented the Position of negotiating of the Canada for the next meeting of the Organization World of the trade . 
very of the support of the government and of the industry , he has calling the abolition of the grants to the export , a reduction of the measures national of support to the agriculture who have a effect of distorsion commercial and a accessibility increased of the farmers Canadian to more of markets . 
these measures are of the elements important of the strategy overall to to improve the income of the producers . 
between time , honourable senators , the government has also the in implement of the measures for increase the income , for facilitate the access to a insurance - crop more complete , for speed the access to the loans and to the savings and for increase the households to the time timely . 
for relieve the impact of a - of the income , the government of the Canada has public , in consultation with the producers and the provinces , the Program of assistance in case of disaster linked to the income agricultural , also called ACRA , program of 1.5 billion of $ . 
the government federal provides 60 per of the funding , and the provinces , the 40 per who remain . 
that represents 900 million of $ , honourable senators . 
he the is of a program of two years to the intention of the farmers who are to the taken with of the small of income criticism . 
the government of the Canada has also respected a commitment of the Minister , the of provide to the farmers of the Payments interim in the framework of the ACRA ; other said , the farmers can have access more quickly to the funds which they have need , to the place of duty expect that all the calculus be facts to the end of 99 , year for which the ask is introduced . 
agriculture and Agroalimentaire Canada has the to the point a formula of calculating quick for help the farmers to assessment the payment which they have right . 
honourable senators , we facilitons also the access to the CSRN . 
we we substantially assoupli the rules provisions to the retraits of the accountable of stabilization of the income net and to the Given in these the . 
in consequential , 41 $ farmers additional have access more quickly to more of funds . 
, the end of the months of June , by the of the consultation with of the provinces , the Minister has announced of the changes to the CSRN who it 117 million of $ of more to the clause of the farmers . 
the retraits of the CSRN and the Payments to the as of the ACRA should , according the forecasts , slow of way appréciable the - of the income in the Prairies in General and in Saskatchewan in particular . 
the Minister of the Agriculture the is to this that the full amount of 1.5 billion of dollar an to the program ACRA be paid for 1998 and 99 . 
in addition , more of per $ farmers of a across to the other of the country have of almost 1,2 billion of $ in their accountable of stabilization of the income net , which they can do of the retraits as now . 
this is to that that they used . 
close of 26 $ farmers the have already fact to up of more of 274 million of $ for power extension this period difficult . 
in Saskatchewan only , to the end of the months of October , someone 13 $ producers have puisé in their CSRN and withdrawn more of 119 million of $ . 
this are of the amounts internal who can help a great number of families of farmers to the back on at . 
a myriad of between you the their surely the of the serious of the difficulties that are the farmers and their family who have been affected by the floods and the drought , and compatissent without doubt to their fate . 
grateful the problem , the government of the Canada has worked of together with the province of the Saskatchewan for improve the regime of insurance - crop on which the as of farmers . 
for relieve the difficulties of the producers , he has assoupli the rules of the regime of insurance - crop , increased the benefits , heavy the treatment of the requests and facility the access to the regime . 
of new measures have been announcements this been , and the farmers of the Saskatchewan have affected until to 25 $ the acre of insurance - crop Supplementary on the neatly not ensemencée , in extra of the 25 $ the acre already some for the neatly not ensemencée in under of the regime of insurance - crop of basic . 
a other supplement of 25 $ the acre has been " to the farmers of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba who not have could plant this spring . 
this assistance is provided to as of payment interim in the framework of the program ACRA . 
the government federal has also taken of the measures to of help the farmers to manage their income in purchased to this that they have of the households the more earlier possible after the season of growth . 
I quote these figures for try of balance the debate , not not for deny the serious problems are are opposite the farmers . 
the sector agricultural knows of serious problems , . not can the deny . 
conjugués , the factors that I I mentioned - low price of the products of basic and the fact that the rules not be not playing - have the this sector of our economy in a situation very difficult . 
this is why , same to the time where we about , of seriously talks have place between the representatives federal and provincial . 
not more later that the week last , the Prime Minister the is ago with the first ministers of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba to this about . 
the Minister federal of the Agriculture , Mr. Vanclief , is in touch Standing with his Provincial provincial . 
the situation is serious and the government the with in consequential . 
that said , I you ask of me forgive this léger gap . 
he must the remind that the government federal and the provinces the shared the responsibility of the situation agricultural and of the sector agricultural . 
the solution to the problem not ahead not in the Adopted of a legislation unilaterally by the government federal . 
by example , according of the information recent from of the province of origin of the senator Gustafson , the are program to the support of the agriculture in Saskatchewan by the Administration provincial have known a further very draconienne since the beginning of the years 90 . 
yesterday , the Auditor provincial of the Saskatchewan , Wayne Strelioff , has announced that the are program to the programs agricultural by the province of Saskatchewan have decreased of more of 70 per since 1991 - 1992 . 
, this time , the are program by the province to the programs agricultural in Saskatchewan the planet to 1,2 billion of $ . 
in 1997 - 1998 , they were of 251 million of $ . 
but this Prime Minister can the present in the capital , from that the government of the Canada him toward immediately 1.3 billion of $ and repartir then in for to the outrage , without same record the any the record of the own government . 
this is a problem federal - provincial . 
he must be corrected by the two levels of government . 
Mr. . Ken Krawetz , the - speak of the Finance of the Opposition official in Saskatchewan , crunch the , crisis of the income agricultural to the government provincial . 
when the Auditor provincial has fact of of the Funding Conducted by the government provincial , he has said : 
this is the reason for which our economy agricultural in the problems that she knows to the time current . 
honourable senators , this who the happened to the level of the government provincial of the Saskatchewan fact an the need of a intervention federal - provincial opposite to this serious situation . 
he not the is not of a case where . can seek to from a advantage partisan . 
this problem is too of importance for the country . 
the challenge to and is too great . 
the problem which are opposite the farmers of the Prairies not is not arts ; he is real . 
he not has not seen the day yesterday and he not will not resolved tomorrow . 
I I talked the efforts loans until to now by the government . 
I hope have given the insurance that the Minister of the Agriculture and the government continue to appreciation of the interest to the regard of this sector very important and that they consentiront of new efforts in a it future . 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , the existence of a crisis in the area agricultural not fact no doubt . 
he is humoured that the agriculture is in crisis since long . 
he is sure also that the governments , provincial and federal , speaks of time to other for help the farmers . 
the difference , today today , this not is not that we not we not of solution to long term , this is that the government federal not the makes not the that the situation in Saskatchewan and to the Manitoba , in the Prairies in General , not is not the same that , to the Canada . 
I say same that , to my notice , all the facts and all the figures cities by the senator Boudreau are greatest . 
I not I no reason of douter of his figures . 
she one the teachers , the doctors , the lawyers , the pompistes and the serveuses . 
same without see the figures , all the world the makes well the that the farmers are in a situation extremely serious . 
this is a situation of long term linked to the senior and to the there of the situation international , therefore , to the exports . 
however , for a reason or a other , the farmers the people this time - this in a situation extremely serious . 
a delegation provincial is came to Ottawa for clamour of the assistance . 
can - be these people would - they could do more , can - be would - they should do more . 
they understand now the serious of the problem and the need of there which immediately . 
they formerly and guide a response whatever of the government federal . 
what has been this response ? 
" rentrez home you , we will review the figures still a time . " 
he not there had not this will of work together , this will of look the Saskatchewan and the Manitoba of a i different . 
the senator Cohen has mentioned some letters sent to the parliamentarians . 
we receiving all of the letters désespérées . 
honourable senators , the problems in Saskatchewan not clauses not only of the questions agricultural international . 
they come in great part of the fact that the agriculture and the questions agricultural own to the Saskatchewan are to the there of the list of priorities of the questions agricultural . 
he not there not to this day a policy agricultural national who é the of the variations and of the employees own to the various regions . 
we not osons not develop a strategy national . 
we we préoccupons always of the problems own to the farmers of the Quebec and of the Ontario . 
we know that the Saskatchewan and the Manitoba have of other problems , without speak of the problems of the producers of fruit of the British - British and of the farmers of the Canada Atlantic . 
we imputons all our problems to the situation international . 
we can speak of the Elimination of the grants and continue actively a strategy , under the direction Mr. Marchi , for to the States - United and the Europe to eliminate their grants . 
the fact is that they not the have not fact in the past and that they not the will not now . 
yet , we back without has to the same strategy . 
we not we nothing fact of new , of novateur or of different . 
our leaders federal must forward a strategy , as they the have fact with the group of Cairns he there has a sure number of years . 
that we has for of wasn of the gains , and we in removed still the benefits in the structures trade global . 
where is the new of helm ? 
if we not we not of strategy , we properly to the pulled of the Americans and of the Europeans . 
nothing in the speech of the government federal not me it hope that he has including that he must to the question under a new contempt . 
we in we had a example striking with the legislation legislative regarding the Board Canadian of the Wheat . 
we we left to the board of Administration of the Board Canadian of the Wheat the be of deal the problems of the farmers Canadian and of the west of the Canada to the place of develop of the programs of support legitimate to the intention of the farmers . 
by example , what is our policy of marketing of the grain ? 
the problem , this is that the government federal not includes not that he must do evidence of creativity and attempt of find of new solutions to the crisis of the agriculture in the Western . 
the first ministers provincial not have not always , them not more , including the message . 
he has was of the election for in réveiller few - each and their do understand that we not are not to the taken with a problem Standing which he must find a solution to long term . 
we are in full crisis . 
the ministers Goodale and Vanclief would still that he is possible of deal the problem with the programs existing . 
during that they understanding of proof their point , the farmers are bankrupt . 
he not we will more that of major companies agricultural . 
the government must play frank - stake . 
to - he that the agriculture continues of be a way of life copy who assure the production of the substantially who we are necessary ? 
we can continue to manipulate the figures , he rest that the farmers of the Saskatchewan are more many that never to abandon their Lands . 
the families about of the pressure without precedent . 
we not properly not in legislation of support the agriculture in Saskatchewan if we let on this lancée . 
honourable senators , the time frame is expired . 
of the speech have been heard in the two Houses . 
all the parties other that the of the government recognize that the debate has been enough long and that he is to present of take a commitment north . 
if the Prime Minister , or the Minister of the Agriculture , had " a assistance of emergency to the farmers of the Saskatchewan , who are waiting for cent of the people , he their would given a in of recognition . 
today today , we comptons the votes . 
the Saskatchewan and the Manitoba not will not the majority . 
he not is not in our interest of criticism this situation to the provinces . 
these last will amenées to assume their share of all program who will led and they have already indicated their agreed . 
the government federal seems reject his responsibilities on the other and he not has nothing proposed of moreover to this day . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate has redit that the government étudierait the figures advanced and that he retirements his business in of the committees denies of the representatives of the provinces and of the community agricultural . 
the government federal is the only to support that the program in into give of good results . 
all the agencies agricultural , the governments provincial and particularly the farmers forward the contrary . 
honourable senators , that will he hurts for that the government come in assistance to those who want continue of ensure the supply food and for that the Saskatchewan and the Manitoba continue of do part of the organizes Canadian ? 
the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I thank the hon. senator Gustafson of have launched this debate of emergency on this important question . 
I thank the senators Spivak , Andreychuk , Gustafson , Tkachuk and Sparrow who , during the spring and the fall , have often asked of the questions to the government on the problems that knows the sector agricultural , particularly in Saskatchewan and to the Manitoba . 
honourable senators , he is important of know that , when the government federal working with the provinces , the associations agricultural , the farmers and the producers to the preparation of a plan , and that the plan not works not , he not must not in do to all the blame to the government , this who is too often the case . 
however , this not is not a program the in Bill only by the government federal . 
this is a program federal which the provinces involved . 
the provinces were like of announce this program with the government federal . 
they believed that he would the producers agricultural in difficulty in the together of the country . 
hélas , that not has not been the case . 
when the government federal said that he must examine the criteria , study the program and find of the ways of the do operate , we must there see someone something of valid . 
when the government federal fact out that he not is not the only another in because and that he not can propose a program that the other parties who Lillian to the program distinct not both not , we not can not act . 
this not is not a problem who depends only of the government federal . 
since the ACRA is a program to 60 / 40 , that means that the provinces must offset 40 forced of the costs . 
the a of the more important problems are the farmers of the south - west of the Manitoba and of a great part of the Saskatchewan have fact opposite has been the flood . 
the Prime Minister Romanow Mr. Vanclief , the Minister federal of the Agriculture , in are came to a agreement . 
they the are heard on a amount Supplementary of 50 $ by acre of ground not ensemmencé . 
that the is - he past in my province ? 
the Prime Minister , before the present to the voters , has decided of not not sign this agreement . 
the government federal not could go of the before without the participation of the province since the program of insurance - crop is a program earnings . 
this not is not a program federal unilatéral . 
he is important of know exactly why the ACRA not works not . 
clear , the criteria under by all the partners not were not the good . 
was - this wanted ? 
there has he had a attempt deliberate of to in place a program who not fonctionnerait not ? 
not , I not the believe not . 
I think that the senator Andreychuk has reason , he would was be particularly sensitive to the problems of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba . 
let why the program not has not given the results hoped . 
the senators Spivak and Andreychuk have brought to my attention the fact that the farmers were forced of the address to a cash that they payaient 400 , 500 or higher $ for that he remplisse the risks . 
clear , this is the first mistake . 
if the risks was so eliminated , we have should provide to the farmers the assistance necessary for the duties . 
we not the we not fact . 
he is unfortunate that we we did this opportunity , s to the beginning of the making academic , of Engage and of form of young students in accounting for help the farmers to duties these risks . 
we not the we not fact . 
the senator Sparrow has fact out that , for a sure program , the risks not rentraient same not in the need who were Debates . 
this was can - be a program different , but we not we not responded also quickly to this kind of details that we have should the do . 
that the is - he past ? 
on a program of 1.5 billion of $ , which 900 million of the government federal , according my more recent figures , only 236 million have been questioned . 
the senator Gustafson : 
the money is also went to the bad people . 
the senator Carstairs : 
where will the rest of the money ? 
the senator Spivak : 
, the bad people . 
the senator Carstairs : 
why these farmers in the need not are - they not eligible to these funds ? 
how can - we do in so that they receive this money ? 
before that we not begin to speak of new funds , we must we ensure that the farmers of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba receive the money already committed . 
I am fully outset that the Minister Vanclief working of however - at , s for find quickly the way of back the rest of this money to the farmers of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba . 
we must examine the price . 
we must understand that , to nowhere other time of our history , the price not have been also there , in $ comparable . 
we must work in cooperation , and I not about not only of the provinces and of the government federal . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate has underlined the contributions reduced that the government of the Saskatchewan fact to the agriculture . 
I am désolée of say that the same situation there to the Manitoba . 
all the world has Anicet and decided of spending least for this sector . 
honourable senators , of the changes very complex have dismantling the evolution of the agriculture in the west of the Canada . 
we not we not still responded as he is to all these changes . 
the only way which we réussirons to satisfy to the needs of the farmers of the west of the Canada , this is if the governments federal and provincial , the farmers and the agencies of producers Lillian all . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , I thank His the the Speaker of have for this debate . 
some of between you not the know can - be not , but he has to a time represented a riding agricultural that I know well , soitSte. Rose , to the Manitoba . 
I I also well liked the comments from of the other side of the House , be those of the senator Carstairs and of the Leader of the government . 
I know that their comments are sincere . 
I not challenging not the fact that of the dirty have been views of share and of other . 
we must work together , but he rest a sure number of points to clarification . 
, my notice , . not recognizes not enough the uniqueness none of the problem . 
he not is not of the look on the programs in into ; they not have not of importance to the time current . 
the problem is none . 
why the problem is - he if none ? 
the situation is well worse that in the years 30 because that the farmers are many more debt . 
they have spent of the are incredible to the acquisition of believed and of intrants . 
now , the Banking are ready to before the hailed in too of guarantee . 
the farmers not come not to pay their taxes . 
can - be is - he true that the government of the Saskatchewan has reduced of 70 per his contribution financial to the community agricultural , but the government federal has contributed to the problem . 
when I about of the government federal , I not hear not only the government Liberal . 
I want say the government federal , the who has reduced of 60 per the grants to the transportation in view of fall the deficit . 
this - was too way and is Westray too quickly and she has had of the consequences surviving for the farmers of the Manitoba . 
he not there has that the government federal who the a assiette tax enough important for provide now this amount of 1.3 billion of $ . 
the governments provincial , and little any the sins who have been made by the authorities previous , and God knows that they have been many , not have not the assiette tax deal for their come in assistance . 
the provinces have reduced the deficit and an of the money to the health and to the education . 
the government federal the is now to a surplus of 60 billion of $ and more to the over of the next years . 
of the money is for to the Fund of staffing of the scholarships of studies of the millennium and to of other activities who are important , but who not constitute not a crisis high . 
as the honourable senators the have said here , a way of life is in are of people . 
any the economy agricultural of the Western is turned under the influence of the integration vertically . 
the Cargill and of other businesses the empareront of more in more of hailed agricultural if we maintenons this Cape . 
if you not want not that that the " , you must act quickly . 
sometimes , the better way of act is to manner in the great . 
these Canadians very productive are taken to the community of a War economic . 
I like that the honourable senators know that our farmers are productive . 
yet , the government not seems not see the enormous disadvantage competitive of the farmers Canadian which the sector has leapt the year last for 26 billion of $ . 
this not is not the access to the markets who is in because here , but the price paid for the happened . 
the access to the markets can help the producers , but when this access is finally assured , he is can - be already too later . 
the competition is impossible on the markets of export when the grants paid by the States - United and the Europe are imports to well of the time this that the government of the Canada can be . 
the message that the government has persistent to the farmers by the through of the first ministers provincial the week last not had nothing of surprisingly . 
the government their has fact know that he contain their ask of assistance Supplementary . 
they are true in July . 
Dwain Lingenfelter , the Minister of the Agriculture of the Saskatchewan , states that the figures of the government federal conventions can - be of serious mistakes . 
course , the opinion is biased because that he working and in in Saskatchewan , that he the indications with the farmers and that he at the problem of close . 
by against , the officials federal have , according the words of Rex by , the advantage " of a perspective déformée by a périscope of vision to long distance " . 
the Minister Lingenfelter has should that the figures federal surestimaient the gains , there including in the case of the Payments in under of the ACRA and of the CSRN . 
of a way or of the other , these new estimates indicate a reduction of 60 million of $ of the costs of and in Saskatchewan , this who is appréciable . 
. not knows not of where people these figures . 
the Minister of the Agriculture of the Manitoba has said that the forecasts federal official for the Saskatchewan and the Manitoba , who have been published in July , invited valid because that very little of things have changed since . 
however , the ministers provincial have said that the payment of equalization of 1.3 billion of $ to the chapter of the trade , that they had asked of Ottawa , was well little . 
, the across of the the , little any the estimates , he is indéniable that our farmers have need of assistance now . 
they are fully related to the economy and to the trade to the the World . 
the price that the farmers must be for the property and services are constantly in increase . 
I am referring to the engrais , to the herbicides , to the fuel , to the services public , to the assurance and to the upkeep . 
, they only , the Estimates the recommend between 60 and 80 $ by acre . 
this amount not includes not the taxes , the upkeep to the property and the borrowing for the equipment who can achieve 40 $ by acre . 
when the Wheat the vendait 160 $ the would and the theory 355 $ the would , the farmer earned in end of the someone something . 
this year , the price of the Wheat the at to 24 per beyond - minimum of the average of the five last years and the price of the theory has descended of a third . 
the price of the products has reached the a of the levels the more there never known , for three reasons . 
the first is that this year , all as the year last , the production is far Superior to the average . 
the second is that the ask has descended in reason of the situation financial in the world , particularly in Asia . 
the third is that our major competitors , the States - United and the Union European , guarding their farmers of these conditions trade very get in their easier of strong grants . 
as have could the see the members of the committee of the agriculture when they the are people in Europe , these grants encouragent the surproduction , who system a saturation of the market and fact drop the price . 
the grants who are awarded , constitute a problem important for our farmers . 
since 1993 , the Canada has reduced of 45 per the assistance that he would to the agriculture . 
the States - United the have reduced of 34 per , and she not has not virtually not falling in the Union European . 
the OECD believe to 17 $ American by acre , in average , the assistance granted to all the farmers - not only to the producers of grain and of seeds oléagineuses . 
this assistance is of 45 $ by acre to the States - United and of 362 $ by acre in the Union European . 
without measures of support of the income additional outlined to fair as by the delegation of the Saskatchewan as of the Payments of equalization commercial , the farmers of the Saskatchewan will collectively about 48 million of $ . 
. evaluated these losses to per million of $ to the Manitoba . 
no sector industrial not could hope stay competitive in of such circumstances . 
he must deal the problem of the grants international . 
between - time , the government federal must help more our farmers . 
if , our farmers must back their Lands , a to a , to the Banking and to the them who can the allow of expect that the government has of the entêter or that the country of the UE réduisent the assistance that they overwhelmingly to their farmers . 
, the the of the studies and of the trip in Europe of the committee Senate of the agriculture , we know all that the poules will of the you before that the UE réduise the assistance . 
if the government continues of follow this line of conduct , he becoming a seaway without precedent for our country . 
contrary to the governments who not could hardly offer of assistance to the time of the great crisis , the government present has of the money . 
he would the ways of help the producers food to overcome this period difficult . 
honourable senators , I about particularly of the people of the west of the Canada . 
the producers dairy and the producers of volaille the in which well in reason of the programs of management of the offer . 
some could any the government federal and of other levels government of be to the origin of the problem , because they have imposed to the sector agricultural of the cuts higher to 1 billion of $ for deal the problem of the deficit . 
why the government should - he help the farmers to keep their Lands ? 
in as that CIBC of the Western , I would tentée of say that he should the do because that the sector agricultural is the soul of a broader part of our country . 
I about here of the hailed agricultural family . 
this way of life is also asset for the families of farmers that the French the is for the Quebecers , that the life in sea or to closest of the - this the is for the people of the provinces of the Atlantic and that the mountains and Forestry the are for the Columbians - Columbians . 
I am tentée of speak of the value cultural and patrimoniale of the agriculture . 
I know however that to the across of the the , he not there will that the figures who compteront for the government - the number of seats , the revenues and the statistics on the exports . 
honourable senators , I hope that some of between them not conservation not too to controversy . 
a their costs sometimes 2 $ or more . 
the the the Speaker : 
the senator Spivak : 
I ask the leave of continue . 
the the the Speaker : 
leave is - she granted ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Spivak : 
, reason of 30 bushels to the acre , the 160 rapids of the farmer limited of what do for 342 $ $ of their . 
the farmers are can - be to the on of the bankrupt , but many of people rely on their grain for wasn a joli profit or body a income modest . 
a other example important is the done of barley who loses of the money on all the rapids . 
in produisant 50 bushels to the acre and in the selling to of the brasseries for do of the frequenting , the done génère of the revenues tax great for the governments federal and provincial . 
finally , honourable senators , I tabled of the letters of children of our region for that the Senators of those - this be heard . 
he must refute this disaster if the . not to not that any the economy agricultural of the Western be turned . 
I - I the leave of table these letters ? 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , the senator Spivak ask to table of the letters . 
want - you that these letters be tabled ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the hon. Douglas Roche : 
honourable senators , he the the this last a debate capital on the difficulties of the industry agricultural of the Canada . 
the agriculture is the heart of the economy of my province , the Alberta , and the farmers of the province not have not liked the treatment insensitive who has been " to the first ministers of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba when they have presented their requests legitimate to the government of the Canada . 
this insensibilité of the government federal has fact of as more difficulty that she the is benchers to the time where the government federal engrangeait a extraordinary surplus . 
the farmers and their leaders have been disappointed by the lack of leadership of the government , who not has not responded of way satisfactorily to the situation monster in which the find the farmers Canadian . 
of the families are in are of losing their firm , and of the plants must close their doors in Alberta and in Saskatchewan , this who the being by of the losses of jobs and a great distress social and economic . 
we are witnesses of the agony of any a industry and of his effects devastating on the people of the Western . 
will - we say to the people of the Western that the government federal not can nothing do for she then that he must decide what do with his biodegradable surplus budget who not same of at . 
he is clear that the people of the Western has need of a assistance transitional of the share of the government federal for the adapt . 
the industry is price struck because that his competitors of the other country benefit of grants to the export and of grants internal . 
the government must surely to the of the difficulties of the Prairies in the development of his strategy for the summit to come of the Organization World of the trade , who the will to U.S. . 
however , the situation current not must not be unabated during the negotiations trade , who could lasted long , because those - this not will of no lot if the industry agricultural is completely careers . 
a assistance federal Supplementary is required now . 
the hon. Nicholas W . Taylor : 
honourable senators , I at to this debate with a some carking , because in the area of the agriculture , he is difficult of take exactly the measures who the do . 
we we strictly on the Standards to a free market to the year , and we let the and agricultural é not only as a business , but as a home , a way of life and a community , as . the has already underlined . 
this is a problem difficult . 
he is of the remind that he there has to only six years , the organizations agricultural were to Ottawa and to Edmonton , where I at to the legislative legislative , for ask to the government of the withdraw of the sector of the agriculture . 
I am a member of the committee of the agriculture and we parcourons the Western , in particular the Manitoba and the Saskatchewan , who have more of " that the Alberta , my province , and where the problem is probably worse still . 
of more , in as that member of the committee of the agriculture , I I visited the Europe for try of me speak with the representatives of the Community European . 
as the senator Spivak the has out to fair as , the Europeans not have not really the intention of change . 
. authorization in the area of the agriculture to a revolution in someone so . 
the government present , who the find be my government , is forced of into the assistance to the operators agricultural and to the producers of substantially in service of the happened in a form of insurance - income . 
that is come all naturally to the Canada because , in as that Canadians , we exportons a if great share of our production food compared to all other country that , if we tentions of firms the price of our products , that he the whether of Wheat , of they or of what that this be of other , the rest of the country not could not costs these Estimates . 
and , we we found a solution who , we the hope , will quickly agreed by the Europe Western . 
. has had a view of that in Germany and in Scandinavie where , to the place of pay the producers of substantially in service of the units of production , that he the whether of a cow , of a pinte of milk or of a bushel of grain , . has established a some form of insurance - income . 
we we tried of do understand to the Europeans of the Western that their method government to pay the producers of substantially in service of the happened conduisait to the pollution of their Environment . 
of the nitrites contaminaient their nappe phréatique to because of a too great fertilisation and of a invasion for various types of bad herbes , and that to the the of changes génétiques for increase the production of grain . 
the Europeans modifiaient the grain and the rest . 
when . award the farmers in service of their production , as the Europe of the Western and the States - United the are , . because many of pity to the Environment . 
very judicieusement , the Canada has deliberation for the insurance - income . 
in fact , we not should not look the bébé with the water of the bain . 
the insurance - income the effondre in the Prairies . 
he not there has not of doubt that our way of excellent the income not works not very well in Saskatchewan and to the Manitoba . 
however , he is interesting of see that this regime works well in Alberta . 
that me ennuie of the say , because that I was part of the Opposition and that I I attacked the government to the time , but the members of the government albertain have been among the first to the Canada to propose the idea of ensure the income . 
that has very well fonctionné . 
a sure number of accidents geological and much are that this province has least of problems that we , in Saskatchewan and to the Manitoba , but she uniting to deal the problem better that the other provinces . 
this is particularly because that she has consulted the producers agricultural , the amenant to think to the insurance - income , not for obtain as of $ the acre or as of $ for the Wheat , this who false the market . 
if the . is really in favour of the market free , . to do the system of way to this that the market free works well , this who i , well course , the existence of a insurance - income whatever . 
, this regard , the government Canadian has fact a not in the good direction in instaurant the ACRA and the other programs of assistance designed for reward the farmers and the producers of have épargné of the money in tomorrow of days more difficult . 
in Ontario , the allowance reached about 15 $ $ by done and , in the together of the Canada , she is of to little close 14 $ $ by done . 
all system or program based on the income require that the farmers the roles of their accounting well differently that . not the was in the past . 
if the government is found of someone something , this is can - be of the lack of sensitivity which the bureaucrats have fact evidence in instaurant a regime of insurance - income rather that a regime of insurance - products . 
that the . the shows sometimes little compassionate , is who is inexcusable . 
the problem has can - be been accomplices by the fact that the government the is shown a little insensitive in his relations with the farmers in this who respect the regime of insurance - income , but he must see the things of the point of view of the farmers . 
their fatalisme and their despair not are not fully the fact of the government , and their sentiment the timely and : " If the government not has not could sell my Wheat the year last and that the Hempline are dominant this year , then that I not cultive that of the grain , that will - I do the year next ? " 
. not move not , and can - be the should - . , of the ways of change the system for offer to the farmers of the prospects of future in this area . 
the only way who seems the offer to them is to do competition to the Europeans of the Western and to the Americans , who benefit of grants , and to ask then to the government of fill the difference . 
they know that all government will by say : " It must to a preferment to all care . 
. can more you firms on the basic of the over of the products agricultural . " 
a so of revolution the is in the production food . 
the farmer not knows not to what the in to ; the Opposition said that the government not knows not the solution , and nothing not me allows of believe that the Opposition , here or to the other place , the knows . 
honourable senators , I like that he we be proposed a solution of alternative - that he we be proposed a little more that a simple review objective . 
he so sometimes that the first idea be the good . 
we we our own committee of the agriculture . 
we could can - be do a effort for the producers of the sector agroalimentaire , their back hope in their allowing of continue their activity in their community and of there do supplying their children , to the place of we settle of their remind that he we must support the competition of the Americans and of the Europeans and that we even of money . 
this not is not a solution . 
of such say that the protection of the income is as a depend of security who would sympathized under the not of a funambule . 
if we réussissons to to in place a program of protection of the income who , by the action of the free business , will to the farmers of find their own solutions of alternative , we will work someone something . 
I ask urge to the Senate of lead a action in this sense , because this not are not the ideas who we are . 
the hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , I like before any something thank His the the Speaker of have authorized this debate today today . 
this reduction has been opérée by a government NDP - advised . 
this initiative has without doubt for of intangibles the deficit of the province . 
, the seen of the situation current , the government and the senators of in opposite should power encourage the province to mobilizing of the financements supplementary , since they the while if well with the NDP - Conservative . 
Melenchuk and Romanow are partners in policy , they members of the same side of the House , and , in this who respect the people of the Saskatchewan , they not are that a . 
and personally , in this who respect the farmers , they not are that a . 
as the has fact having the senator Spivak , this election has incitéM. Romanow , the Prime Minister of the Saskatchewan , to directing Ottawa for in obtain of the assistance for his farmers . 
in my quality of Conservative , I then to all the least saying that Alvin Hamilton , John Diefenbaker , Don Mazankowski , Bill McKnight , Charlie Mayer and Brian Mulroney these the time of listen and of understand the Canadians of the Western . 
I not can not in say as of the present government federal . 
when he was our Prime Minister , Mr. Mulroney he the time of the look on the situation of the agriculture in the Western ; and he succeeds to in cerner the problems , to the contrary of the predecessor immediate , who was of allegiance Liberal and who is , well heard , the present Prime Minister . 
, my notice , that the price of the products of basic he not interest not the Liberal . 
by example , when the price of the Oil is times and that the Canadians of the Western have began to in withdraw the benefits , the Liberal have the in place the Program Energy national , a program who these to the provinces productrices of Oil of the billion of $ who their belonged for the lifetime to all the rest of the Canada . 
by the the , they have paid the price policy and despite the small sursaut of 1993 , he paieront still a time the price policy . 
the response of the government to this crisis has been the program ACRA . 
this is a response Liberal typical . 
this is a program of assistance social . 
we not remplissons not of risks . 
this not is not and that we responding . 
yet , this is this that the Liberal the waiting to this that the farmers do . 
in 1996 - 1997 , the income agricultural net national has descended of 55p. per , and has descended still of 35p. per in 1997 - 1998 . 
in Saskatchewan and to the Manitoba , the income agricultural is negatively . 
the government present not has not of policy agricultural national . 
all this that he move when he there has a problem in the Western this are of the solutions interim . 
in the areas very peuplées of the East , he there of the boards of marketing , a program of grants paid directly to the done by the so . 
this is exactly this in what is a board of marketing . 
this is a monopoly . 
in the Western , we we débrouillons all only . 
we know all this who the what in Europe . 
some country pay until to 8 $ the bushel of Wheat . 
the governments European the subventionnent , because they not can not the sell to this price . 
they not can same not the brader . 
of other country not want not more eliminate their programs of grants that we not want eliminate our boards of marketing . 
the reason to that is that , a time that you are habitués to the grants and that you grandissez and that you you enrichissez with these grants , he becomes politically impossible of the eliminate . 
this is this who so in Europe . 
the Americans the are waved in the battle . 
they have decided of the fight against the Europeans and they subventionnent now their agriculture . 
during this time , the poor farmers of the Western Canadian , not from not of protection on the market , the find in a impasse . 
this not is not rare in the Western . 
this not is rare nowhere share for the farmers . 
when the Lands of a farmer are fertiles and that he see of other people from the benefits of his Lands , do of the their , of the whisky , of the frequenting or flair his products to there price in the world world and that that not him quoted nothing , the situation is criticism . 
this is this who the what today today in the Prairies . 
the senator Taylor has said that he not had not heard the senators of this side - this propose of solutions . 
I not know not very well this that we should do , but I know a something : we not can not continue of grow of the products that all the other country subventionnent . 
we know our economy and we know that if the under are bradées in Europe , . not can not do of profit on the under in America of the North . 
however , this is this that are these country . 
they bradent their Wheat . 
the Canada is a country exporter . 
he not there has not enough of people to the country for eat all this that we produisons . 
we must the protect because that they know how operating these Lands . 
we not can the let the appauvrir and leave their Lands . 
we must to on at a program national who would based not not on the assistance social , but rather on a strategy agricultural industrial providing that these Lands should serve to other something . 
honourable senators , we must also be a period of transition . 
I believe that he would be a period of transition of ten years to the over of which the farmer host a some amount by acre of land . 
he would then considerations to adopt a culture effective since he would then more of money . 
however , he not would not reduce the payment to the acre " to a farmer who uniting . 
practices - we rather that he nervous for that he be in legislation of abandon him - same the grant . 
this is this that we must do . 
we not can not ask to the Europeans of abandon to the grants . 
forget that . 
we know all this who so with the assistance social . 
the people among of more in more dépendants and they say of the in out . 
this is this who so . 
the Americans have decided of act other . 
in as that Conservative , I believe that the life deals is a great importance for a country . 
I not like not that all the Canadians live in of the cities . 
the regions rural constitute a kind of found . 
good number of people consider that he is well of power go in the nature or of the expressed in a canoeing where he not there has human . 
. the ' in someone so only . 
if you are already achievement in the regions rural of the Saskatchewan , of the Alberta , of the Quebec or of the Ontario , you know exactly this that I want say . 
the regions rural are different and they are important . 
however , they must also be which of the point of view economic . 
the people of the regions rural are intelligents . 
for live and survive in campaign , he must be gracious and work very . 
giving a little of hope to the farmers . 
damning of say that they are in difficulty and that he there a program of assistance social . 
that not will in nothing . 
these people not want not of the assistance social . 
they not in have never wanted and not in want not more now . 
however , I will you say a something . 
if we the which dépendants of the assistance social , they not will more the in to . 
Mr. . Romanow is come here . 
I not think not have been never of agreed with Roy Romanow , but this time - this , I him give reason of be come . 
the Prime Minister of the Manitoba the accompagnait and that of the leaders of the Opposition and of the delegations of farmers . 
he not has not been well treaty . 
the government not has not " a priority very high to their concerns . 
we we listened the speech that the Minister of the Finance has fact yesterday ; he not has not a only time mentioned the agriculture , and this , a week after their visit . 
! ! yes , this is important , but in the speech of the Minister of the Finance , this not is not also important that that . 
he said : " I I 90 billion of $ to spending , I much of forward . 
can - be will - I you give a small reduction of taxes and we will repay a little the debt . " 
honourable senators , the ACRA is difficulty designed . 
we know that this program not works not ; not we therefore not of drama someone something who not will not . 
débarrassons - we - in and have the by someone something who works . 
this program was supposed operate to the spring . 
we are now in fall . 
the farmers of the Saskatchewan must very soon the prepare for the spring . 
the government has the this program on at to the spring , the farmers have fact their ask and they waiting always the money . 
this not is not as that that . reacts to a emergency . 
same a time that this debate will taken end , I hope that we able the continue under a form or a other until to this that we réussissions to find a solution able of solve to the least few - each of the problems . 
we can probably work more together in our institution that in not any what other institution policy to the Canada because that we are here for long , the health by . 
we , of this side - this of the Senate , know this that the . must do , and this that the . fact now not been not . 
we welcome our colleagues of in opposite to examine carefully this that fact their government . 
we you prions of ask to your Prime Minister of visit the provinces of the Prairies and of take the time of listen this that the farmers and the representatives of the municipalities and of the governments provincial have to say , because that they are more close of the people . 
they the concern of their communities . 
they will can - be then completely of agreed with we for say that he there has a situation of emergency in the west of the Canada and that he must there which . 
the hon. Herbert O . Sparrow : 
honourable senators , I like of first thank and same congratulate the senators who members to the committee of the agriculture to comments of the Position that they have position to the regard of the world agricultural to the over of the year last , and certainly before . 
the senators Spivak , Andreychuk , Gustafson , Hays and Fairbairn have all contributed of way important to do understand to the government and to all the Canadians the crisis that facing the industry agricultural to the Canada , and more particularly in Saskatchewan , to the Manitoba and in Alberta . 
let - me of the congratulate , because he not there will can - be not many of other choirs in my intervention . 
I not know not too this who the what when we we of the debates of emergency . 
I know to who the message is advocates , but the debate not in remains not least important . 
according a dicton , he not must not try of drama this who been well . 
this system not been not of the all . 
enough , this is enough . 
we we heard speak of plans for do : or that and of amendment of risks . 
nothing not the what , during that the farmers the acheminent to the bankrupt . 
when the problem has surgi , in November of the year last , a program has been proposed . 
the senator Carstairs said that all the parties the are heard and that he there has had cooperation with the organizations agricultural and the governments . 
he there has indeed had of the consultation . 
he seemed heard that the funds of the program ACRA would paid very earlier in the new year . 
that not the is not happened . 
the senator Carstairs said that all the world has coopéré . 
this is false . 
I I attended to of the meetings with the representatives of the Department of the Agriculture , which the Minister . 
I believe that the program , such that he has been proposed , was excellent and would well market . 
when he has finally been the public , with the risks of the ACRA , he is became obvious that the program not marcherait not . 
he is all also obvious today today that he not has not market and that he not marchera not . 
when she has seen how the system the apply to the level of the and and where would the money , she has withdrawn the support . 
not a only organization agricultural of the Western - I not cannot say this who the what in the East - not does the program ACRA . 
the governments provincial not have not given their agreed . 
the money was be paid to the beginning of the year . 
. has criticized to the governments provincial of not not participate . 
. has said that the Saskatchewan contain of sign the agreed , but the province has débloqué his 200 million of $ and the has the in contingency as January and February 99 . her not has received the agreed for signing that in June . 
that was the Department federal ? 
why the government federal he - he as of time to send a agreed ? 
the money of the government of the Saskatchewan , be 200 million of $ , must be paid on a basic of sharing of the costs . 
the he not the is not , this is that the money of the government federal not is not that . 
the time is crucial for the community agricultural . 
. can well speak of programs to long term . 
this not was not the months last or he there has six months . 
tackling - we to the crisis . 
on the money in the hands of the farmers . 
. about of funds deprive . 
yes , he must of the funds deprive , but . can save well of the it family in bounds of the funds who have already been engaged . 
those who not are not to the aware of the problems looking often what will the term of the program . 
they want know if this is a assistance in a only time or if she will always in place . 
he is possible that she be always necessary . 
if we not can provide the necessary , we must the say frankly to the farmers Canadian and the avertir that he not there will more no grant . 
that they the gain dignement . 
giving - their the money and say - their that this is last , but let - the the lead to of other activities in the community with dignity , without supplier or quêter , without die of hunger , without think to the suicide . 
all that the happened now . 
he must look the things in opposite . 
we not asking not during how of time the benefits of Old will paid . 
we not effectively not to the people seniors of the benefits of Old during a year or two for then the their withdraw . 
however , in the case of the community agricultural , reach extremely important of our society , we we asking the he want still of the money the year next . 
want - we a industry agricultural to the Canada ? 
he must we decide . 
we are on the point of abandon to all these systems on the scene international . 
all the sectors affected found , them also , very soon of the problems . 
that not fact no doubt . 
, this time - that , we not properly more in legislation of acuity to our needs food . 
this is the aspect crucial of the problem . 
if we abandonnons the farmers of the Western , if we let the market international impose his rules , he the in will for say that we should also abandon the farmers of the Quebec and those of the Ontario . 
then , he not we will more that to import the substantially food . 
during of the years , I I across the country for speak of the conservation of the soil , of the would of the firm é in reason of the diminution and of the destruction of the enjoyment arable . 
I the I fact , because that , in as that nation , we must power acuity to our needs food . 
this is the objective that is the community European . 
she underscored for power acuity to his needs . 
the Canada states that he can always import of the products , but that not is not the solution . 
we must be in legislation of acuity to our needs food . 
I like that the hon. senator Carstairs be here . 
she has mentioned to what point he is difficult of duties the risks of the ACRA . 
she had reason . 
he there has 45 or 47 pages of instructions who follows how duties a accompany of seven pages . 
the senator Carstairs has said that we have should would of the students for help the farmers to duties their risks . 
the Department of the Agriculture has provided of the assistance ; of the officials are achievement in the west of the Canada for explain how duties the risks of the ACRA . 
why not have - they not simply designed a accompany who not is not involved ? 
not , they have favourite spending of the thousands of $ for explain this that he was do of these 47 pages . 
these risks not have not been forwarded before March or April and they not have not been diffusés widely . 
the officials of the Department of the Agriculture me have said that I could obtain the accompany on Internet . 
not are - they never achievement visit in Saskatchewan the hailed agricultural in difficulty ? 
how were - we then on Internet ? 
I not I not could obtain of accompany . 
finally , the office of the Department of the Agriculture of my community has received two risks in May . 
. in has fact of the photocopies who have been implemented to our clause . 
we discussing now of this who not go not rond in the sector agricultural . 
. we said that the farmers inefficient not have not their place . 
the Minister said that if someone a not so not to gain his life in this sector , he should in out . 
this is that a option , but our farmers not are not inefficient . 
we we are débarrassés of those who were inefficient he there has 20 or 30 years . 
I I already said that and I the said still today today . 
as the senator Spivak the knows , if we continue of we mothballing of those that we by inefficient , he not will that a only farmer . 
we examine then that he is him also inefficient and we we débarrasserons of him . 
of major companies of and agricultural will then in place , they will fully into , and the farmers will all lost . 
in Saskatchewan , if nothing not change , in 20 years , he will two major cities , those of Saskatoon and of Regina . 
he not will more of communities rural . 
of the small cities have already 3.6 and , if nothing not change , he not in will more no . 
what kind of province , what kind of country would that the produce ? 
this are that the problems that we must examine . 
of such want that the Prime Minister the non in Saskatchewan for see of visu the situation . 
he not has not to the do . 
all they of people the have already fact . 
this not will however not sufficient . 
the message just surely of , . 
today today , the Leader of the government to the Senate not has up of to this message . 
I regret that he not be more here ; he not includes can - be not the situation . 
he there has a problem , and . the there attack in préconisant the sacrifices . 
. not has of say : " candidates will do : , . will do that . " 
in pending , the problem perdure . 
. about of the cooperation of the provinces . 
the money that the provinces have agreed of be to the farmers is that - he enough of the distribute . 
the Minister of the Agriculture not touch not of say that he there has many of money in the CSRN . 
this is a program which help as the government federal that the farmers . 
according the data of the months of August , who are the last that we we on the CSRN , 22 $ farmers on 58 $ have of least of 2 8,700 $ in this the . 
that not from not the Minister of say that he there has many of money in the CSRN . 
for those who are to the on of the crumbling , he not there not of money . 
he not there has nothing for them . 
, the 20 October , 6 800 farmers had from a payment in the framework of the program ACRA . 
however , they not are not those which we we Ahmadi . 
we we Ahmadi des30 $ farmers who will ruinés . 
I using this figure since a year now . 
or well we goes completely these 30 $ farmers , or well we goes the young farmers who should take the provincial of the more old . 
I urge the Leader of the government to the Senate to to this message to the government . 
the program that the organizations agricultural formerly not is not the who has been the in implement . 
this is why they not the both not . 
. we said that few ajustements there will Regional . 
he is easy of amend the program . 
we could ask simply that he be eliminated and replaced by a new . 
this would well , except that he would expect still a year . 
I not want not that . 
modifions the program in place and versons the money to the farmers . 
he there has a billion of $ . 
versons - the to the farmers . 
we we inquiéterons after that of find of the funds deprive the he in must . 
allow the farmers to the taken with of the difficulties . 
the hon. Ron Ghitter : 
honourable senators , all of first , I wish to thank His the the Speaker of have for the held of our debate . 
this is a debate important . 
I commend all those who have taken the speak until to now . 
not knowing nothing of the life in a and agricultural , I I many learned this after - afternoon . 
the intervention of the senator Sparrow has been excellent . 
he and of other also have said many of the things that I wanted say . 
I rise this last to as of citadin , but of contend , therefore , someone a for who the debate the a foremost a little different . 
as the has said the senator Andreychuk , he must understand that this who is good for the Ontario not is not necessarily good for the Alberta or the Saskatchewan . - contexts economic and demographics are different . 
the effect are different . 
the closest of the markets not is not the same not more in these provinces . 
by therefore , the the of the figures heard today today , . not can not say that this who is good for the Canada will necessarily vibrer a chord sensitive in Saskatchewan or to the Manitoba , where they not have not the resources , the people , the force economic or the power of the Alberta when he the is of come in assistance to the farmers . 
. can do say to little close this that the . to to the figures . 
I not I not the intention of me start in of the over of figures . 
we we all seen these figures . 
if we want do implement useful , he must of first answer to few questions fundamental . 
all the world here will : " Welfare course that yes ! " 
however , he there has of the regions to the Canada , in particular in Alberta , who seem indication that the time of the firm é is to his end . 
he is easy of romancer the firm é . 
he is easy of speak of the point of view of the community . 
the senators Tkachuk , Spivak and Sparrow have spoke of the importance of the firm é for our communities . 
they have spoke of the sentiment that she creates home the people . 
they have spoke of the sentiment of closest and of affiliation to the community that . not has not in city . 
they have spoke of the contribution if important of the firm é to the grounds and to the culture of our country . 
the senator Spivak has said that the firm é was to the Alberta and to the Prairies this that the language can represent for the Quebec , this that the Forestry are for the British - British and this that the fisheries are for the Canadians of the Atlantic . 
his comparaisons are all to fact them . 
she will right to the heart of the existence and of the perpétuation of all this who we any , to we who come of the Prairies . 
when someone a ask if the firm é has still his place to the era of the globalization , of the major companies and of the commercially , I say yes . 
the firm é has still a place very important . 
she fact part integral of the fabric social of our country . 
she is if important that we not can not the let people and losing and someone something of if profoundly enraciné in our society . 
if we recognize the importance of ensure the survival of the communities rural of our country , little any this that the firm é can represent for various people , she has need of a something . 
as any business , that this be in the sector of the fisheries or in the sector pétrolier and Chronicle , he must a something for survive in Affairs . 
all the people of Affairs you say that this something , this is the stability . 
if a business not has not of stability , of predictability or a sense of the planning who him give a idea of this who the happens the year next , she will always in difficulty . 
she will always in the uncertainty and not in will never of go ask of the assistance to the bank . 
without stability , . seems always in are of mendier . 
I believe that , since all the years that I am in policy , the farmers not have never bénéficié of no stability . 
as the has said the senator Taylor , he there has had in Alberta of the programs who have fonctionné . 
he there has had a basic assured and a depend of security are the farmers have could approach for any the bad time and all the other things with which they must tragic . 
however , they not have never had the stability who their would for of being and of continue to we provide the products who are so important and asset for we . 
of the stakeholders have spoke today today of revisiter the question constitutional . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate has said that the provinces must do someone something . 
we we heard that so often . 
. we said that this is their fault . 
I could réciter to the senators a list that of the members provincial of the Manitoba have called when they have presented their representations to the committee Standing of the agriculture and of the agroalimentaire of the House of the Commons . 
he the is of two pages of programs which the government federal the is withdrawn and of cuts made to of the programs with the agriculture , and I hear say today today that the provinces gain of the funds . 
the poor small province of the Saskatchewan withdraw of the money of the assistance to the farmers . 
the government of the Saskatchewan not has not the ways of provide of the assistance to the farmers , then the government federal said that the Saskatchewan is supposed help 40 per of the program of assistance and that as she not the has not fact , the government federal not has not to do what that this be . 
this is of the dérobade . 
this is unacceptable . 
he is unacceptable that the leaders political , provincial or federal , say that that not is not their responsibility . 
this is the responsibility of all the world . 
while that we garbage a senior of $ here and that , the life agricultural in this country will in the amenuisant and the crisis continues . 
of more in more of hailed are saisies , of more in more of hailed by and of more in more of young the in will . 
all the things that we we heard today today are hands and ingenuity . 
they the produced in our country . 
the people speak vaguement of the problem , they not the there attack not really . 
they not want not the start in a War of the figures . 
that not dreaming nothing . 
we we need of a government who strictly beyond - before of the farmers and their move a plan to long term for their ensure the stability during that he working with the provinces . 
honourable senators , this not is not new . 
that not date not of yesterday . 
in the years 70 , I was part of the government albertain and this was the same kind of discussions , the same sentiment . 
of way general , . was for responsible the government federal or such human . 
and in the intervalle , he there has of least in least of farmers . 
the problems have been exacerbés , and we is quagmire in a crisis . 
I believe that we we ourselves in a situation very serious to the Canada rural , particularly in the Prairies . 
he not enough more that the Prime Minister veterinary the first ministers home them in their saying : " Nobody you inquiétez not , a other committee fixera the figures . " 
he is can - be too later . 
he would of emergency adopt of the measures ponctuelles , the time that of the plans to long term grab the day . 
unfortunately , nothing not is fact in this sense . 
. the veterinary the passing and . the book to a battle of figures . 
human not just to of the solutions for ensure the stability of this industry . 
if this is this that he must do , will of the before with that . 
yesterday , Mr. Martin not has same not talked the situation agricultural when he spoke of the forecasts financial and of this that he understandable of do with the itself - saying surplus . 
that in is - he in their case ? 
why not about - we not of agriculture ? 
why rejetons - we always the responsibility on someone a of other and not do - we nothing for correct the situation ? 
honourable senators , he is time of favouring a climate of stability . 
the farmers the deserve . 
if we believe really to the importance of the community deals , we must then do someone something for him come in assistance . 
he is time of stop of speak . 
he is time of begin to do evidence of leadership . 
he is time of offer a some stability to the farmers of the Canada . 
the hon. Joyce Fairbairn : 
honourable senators I thank also the Speaker of have agreed that he the was that of a about the prêtant to a debate of emergency and I thank my friend the senator Gustafson of have seen to this that he be issue . 
this not is not a debate to the about of the statistics . 
this is a debate regarding the difficulties which are opposite today today the special , the families and the children and to on the prospects of future . 
he there of the prospects of future on the plans of the stability in the sector agricultural and of the opportunities on the markets world . 
I I listened all the speakers . 
all have talked with more or least of into the problem and the factors who we Subcommittee here this after - afternoon for speak of the farmers . 
I I in particular listened with openness the intervention of the senator Gustafson . 
this is far of be the first time that I listening the senator Gustafson . 
I I the privilege of sit to the committee Senate of the agriculture , that he behind with many of with and of heart . 
for those of between you who not understand not the operating Economy of the Senate , this is a place where of the people partageant of the points of view political different can the respect and the do of the friends that they garderont long . 
these people can also share and shared indeed of deep concerns regarding of the problems who genealogists the life and the well - be of the citizens , what that be the place where they live to the country . 
this is without doubt that a of the points strong the least well known of the Senate of the Canada . 
honourable senators , no Canadian of the west of the Canada , particularly those of the major sectors agricultural of this region , not can ignore the pain and the insécurité raised by the people of the communities and of the families agricultural and of the small cities rural and of all those who trying of lead of the Affairs in these places by time durs , who must costs the reprehensibly of température , the floods , the drought , the diseases and the pressure of the trade international who there the further of the price of the best products of the world opposite to the granting massive of grants in of other country . 
the committee of the agriculture has heard of the evidence and of the stories in from of all the sectors of this industry then that he worked to the preparation of a report to the intention of the government on the from that the Canada should i to the next negotiations on the trade outside who the actions to U.S. . 
our report , entitled : " - seaway to follow : 
the priorities for the agriculture Canadian and the NRTEE of the millennium " , referme of important recommendations in view of the next negotiations who must be businesses more later to the over of the months . 
but the more important is that he has been given to each of between we of hear speak of the difficulties and of the opportunities of the sector , when we were on the ground , in the Western Canadian , - not not in the wards of meeting of the committees here , to Ottawa , but in our own communities , in our own provinces . 
we we listened the people . 
we we at right in the " of those who are of serious difficulties in reason of circumstances that they not s absolutely not . 
, the over of the months intervening , I I visited all the provinces of the Western . 
I me am entretenue with a great number of operators agricultural - sometimes in company of colleagues , sometimes only , including in the south - west of the Alberta which I am outcome . 
a something is some , and this is that in Saskatchewan , he has length been question of the damage occur by the gushed on the Lands agricultural of the south - is of the province , and of the south - west of the Manitoba also . 
I I spoke to of the farmers who the there are resumed to two time for ensemencer their Lands , for see the pots ruiner their efforts . 
these people have of very serious difficulties financial . 
the crop will inexistante , and the jobs are introuvables . 
some senators well Droit in the comfort douillet of this chamber not the their not the that the fact of he a land , that the - this " or not , removes these farmers of the right of what the allowances of the well - be social ; these people the looking how they will do for acuity to the needs of their family . 
of the senators of all the stripes have met the week last the members of delegations of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba , attack to Ottawa directing of the financements transitoires for help the farmers to extension the next years to the across made he is to hope that , during of the negotiations trade , the Senators of the reason prévaudra , of same that the good will and the openness . 
they we have said to what point the Program of assistance in case of disaster linked to the income agricultural not give not the results hoped by the government federal and by his partners of the governments provincial . 
I like identify some of the people who are attack here the week last . 
they not are that a part of the delegation . 
we we heard Leon Lueke , of the Association of the producers of porc of the Saskatchewan ; Penitentiary Wagner , of the Pro - West Rally Group ; Noreen Johns , a woman passionnée and profoundly concern , of the Saskatchewan Women' s Agricultural Network ; Don Dewar , of the Keystone Agricultural Canola ; Goerge Groeneveld , of Agricore ; Wayne Motherall , of the Association of the municipalities of the Manitoba , who rest usually to the gap of this kind of issues , but as the small cities are of the difficulties , the major cities come to the pecuniary . 
we we spoke to Clay Serby , Minister of the Affairs municipal , of the Preservation and of the fellow of the Saskatchewan ; to Duane Lingenfelter , chairman - Prime Minister and Minister of the Agriculture ; and to Ms Donna Harpauer , MP of the Saskatchewan Party . 
of the Manitoba , we we spoke to the Leader of the Party Liberal , Jon Gerrard , who is a old friend since the time where he sitting as member to the House of the Commons . 
he is clear that we , who must speak to the behalf of this region here , not should not to the focus only on the War of figures which have fact the subject the discussions who the are held the week last . 
we not must not we let distract of this who is really important , this is - to - say all to in Bill for help the farmers in difficulty . 
honourable senators , I believe that we will a response , and that we the will very soon , this who we will of amend the programs in into , of débloquer of the funds , of to the of the point of view of the farmers who have said that the amount of 900 $ $ was appreciate , but that he not would not enough quickly and that he not was not was of the way the more useful . 
we must respond to that , honourable senators , and I am some that we will the do . 
I think that of the ajustements , of the changes and of the commitments will necessary for that the programs working . 
. the is many asked today today if someone a the concern of the problem . 
we must we ask if the country is became insensitive to the past and to the present to the point of ignore this who the what , not in the as in view , not to the television all the night , not in the great centres urban , but in some of the more major rivers of our country that we not échangerions for nothing to the world . 
is why we not can never abandon our farmers . 
yes , we we sentons really responsible . 
in the world of today today , we know that the agriculture is a of the industries the more fragiles and that he there has emergency . 
I the I said , the Minister of the Agriculture will to of the changes very quickly because , honourable senators , we not want not that disparaisse this way of life who has been described today today . 
we want the preserve . 
we want multiplying the opportunities for the farmers , not for the them . 
we want strengthen the links between the communities rural because they are the soul of our regions and of our country . 
I just of a wonderful small city who the Order on . 
I the like many , but I like also the small cities who are Diaspora in the areas rural who the around and which she is his force - of the cities as Coaldale , Picture Butte , Stirling , Taber , Warner , Raymond , Magrath , Cardston , Stand Off , in the contingency of the Gens - Edward - Sang , and Amherstburg MacLeod , where so of things recall the history of the RCMP , and in the mountains , beyond - beyond of the cols , Pincher Creek , and Brocket in the contingency of the was . 
this are the Diaspora of the Oath agricultural on this land which I am outcome and where my great - mother and my great - father were pioneers . 
he worth the only of the stop sometimes for think to this that was the Canada that - there to the beginning of the century . 
he not there had not of buildings or of plants . 
he there had of the it and of the people boldest came by grandchildren groups of all the across of the world . 
the family of my mother is came of the cratère of poussière of the Iowa , looking to improve the fate , and the is Alberta , senator Gustafson , close of North Charelle , in Saskatchewan , where my mother is born . 
this is the basic of our country . 
today today , be a century more later , we can to , through to the Technology and to the technology , but , to the further , despite the disappear , the people of these small cities held really to see their similar , to their speak and to the listen . 
this is to his risk and asymmetry that the little the who the represents to the within of a legislative legislative , where that this be to the Canada . 
in the oubliant , . risk of parent the unity of our country . 
the people held to be related . 
little any the glory that made the Technology , she not is hardly the link between the people . 
as I the I said to the beginning , honourable senators , the debate of this last the really on the people . 
despite the scepticisme of some of my opposite - to - opposite and of my colleagues , I believe firmly that the people must have the first consideration and the priority of the government and of the Prime Minister . 
the government and the Prime Minister move . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , before that we not agreement the hon. senator Gustafson , I want make that the Rules not said nothing of this who the what to 18 p.m. in the framework of a debate of emergency . 
what that he in be , I I felt that the sénat someone that I not me concern not of the clock and I not I therefore not interrompu the hon. senator Fairbairn . 
I i that you souhaitez that I not me concern not of the time ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , I be short . 
I want all of first thank His the of have for the held of this debate . 
I think that this is a decision admirable . 
I want also thank the senators of the two sides . 
this is a day where I am proud of the Senate because I think that we start to accomplish the work who should be fact in this chamber . 
as of the stakeholders of the two sides the have indicated , our community agricultural is with to a very serious problem . 
he there has had of the misunderstandings , but the members of the committee of the agriculture know , and I further until that , that the government not was not completely to blame in the Presented of the program ACRA . 
except mistake , this is to the Federation of the agriculture that . must , in fact , this program . 
. the has the in place on the time for do opposite to the problem in the sector of the porc . 
the productions the vendaient to Torquay , in Saskatchewan , 10 $ room . 
however , that not has not fonctionné for the rest of the Canada and for the céréaliers . 
this program not has absolutely not fonctionné and must therefore be changed . 
honourable senators , the Saskatchewan not has not the assiette tax deal for share the up in a per of 40 - 60 . 
I will be frank . 
the Alberta has the money necessary and can respect this criterion . 
she is pleased of the do and of pay more . 
the farmers Albertans they more , but that so he then in Saskatchewan ? 
of more , he has been question of the neglect of the government provincial . 
he the has been . 
he has balanced the budget to the backs of the farmers . 
he has used our Payments to the as of the program RARB . 
the Alberta has affected 58 $ $ by farmer to the over of the last year where the Payments to the as of the RARB have been paid , the Manitoba 43 $ $ and for my share , I I received a up of 320 $ for my and agricultural . 
anyone said that that not will not of consequences has wrong . 
we about now of mistakes took by the past , and we not can not the let the repeat . 
the agriculture is a industry important for the Canada . 
my great - father the is established in Saskatchewan in 1905 . 
they not have all simply not the money for the pay . 
we must take some decisions and , as the has said the senator Sparrow , they must be taken quickly , because that the period of ensemencement what quickly . 
when . the indications with of the farmers and of the groups agricultural , that say - they ? 
they looking this that they should do now . 
the question is of know how of farmers will ensemencer . 
the situation is very démoralisante . 
that its to only the fuel necessary for expédier the crop . 
this scene the said to the broadens . 
the Hempline of some farmers are gelées . 
they get 88 cents for of the Wheat gelé . 
of the farmers receive 2,05 $ for a bushel of Wheat durum , then that their counterparts American are amorphous of in obtain 5,50 $ the bushel . 
how will - they survive ? 
not , they not the will not . 
a of the great problems who exist now in the world , this is that the country who have need of the substantially food not have not of money . 
, a time , the Canada had of the ships did of Wheat who quittaient Vancouver for the to in Russia , then that they not had same never been made . 
they were simply forwarded that - there , and the Russes achetaient this Wheat . 
today today , the Russia not has more a dime . 
she not has not of money for buy of the Wheat . 
the Minister of the Agriculture of the Russia has appeared before the committee Senate and we the has said outright . 
I could appoint of other country in the same situation . 
the problem is world . 
I hope that . will evidence of sense common to the meetings to U.S. , who débuteront the 29 November and the will until to the 4 December , for attempt of deal this problem world . 
the more important , this is that the government and the Parliament of the Canada the roles of this problem world very important . 
we know all of the country who not have not the ways of buy of the food , but who would happy of eat the they disposaient of these foods . 
he the is of a serious problem . 
he is very sad that , with the resources and the machinerie necessary for produce as never before , we not we not enough of good sense policy for esteem a world who has hunger . 
human not so to understand that . 
a sure number of senators have quoted of the figures . 
take by example the flax . 
I am teetotaliste , but I will examine this that reformed the taxes on the whisky to basic of flax : 79 cents the bushel . 
he there has also the barley , the Wheat , and cetera . 
is - this important for the Canada ? 
goes the is , according me . 
I commend the senators attendance here today today . 
each of we has a role to play . 
we must build a better Canada , and we will the do . 
for complete , honourable senators , I give notice that tomorrow , the Thursday 4 November 99 , I move : 
that the Senate recommends to the government of the Canada of give immediately 1.3 billion of $ to the farmers of the Western , as the have asked the first ministers of this region . 
this assistance should , to the farmers by the through of the Board Canadian of the Wheat , under form of a payment to the acre .

he has also been our senior - Commissioner to the Bangladesh and our ambassador in Burma . 
he has tireless in the missions Canadian to - Hague and to New Delhi . 
but this is to the time where he has been our ambassador to the Peru that he is became a heroes . 
in 1996 , Mr. Vincent has played a role majeur during of the taken of hostages to the residence of the ambassador of the Japan to Lima . 
we believe that his actions have for of save several lives . 
he has received the Tarnopolsky of the service consciousness of the Gouverneure general for his contribution extraordinary to the resolution of this crisis . 
he was a heroes bienveillant and modest and a official esteemed of the Canada . 
he has before of the role important that the Canada can play in the soon of a world more stable and better . 
honourable senators , I like me join to the very hon. Prime Minister and to the Minister of the Affairs foreign for present our sympathy to the family Mr. Vincent , including to the wife Lucie and to his daughter Alexandra . 
the War War World 
the 50 - fifth anniversary of the battle of the Gulf of the St. - Lawrence 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I like today today to tribute to all the Canadians , those who live still and those who we have barely , who have served our country under the flags . 
I want also address a thank very Special to the Canadians who used now to the abroad in the framework of missions of keeping of the peace . 
this after - afternoon , I wish to speak specifically of the battle of the Gulf of the St. - Lawrence , this reference of water who offer of very Gallery panoramas to the Quebec , to the New - Brunswick , in the Island - Edward - Prince - Edward , in Nova - Nova , to Newfoundland - Newfoundland and to the Labrador . 
this is a seaway navigable to the within of the Canada to the time current , and of many Canadians can think that that has always been the case , but in 1942 , this are the under - submarines of the Germany Nazi who there régnaient in with . 
this morning , under the under of our bienveillant Speaker , we we attended to a ceremony in this chamber for Calgarians the battle of the Gulf of the St. - Lawrence of 1942 to 1944 . 
for the updating , well heard , only two ships have been perdus after 1942 , the two in 1944 , and he the is therefore of the 50 - fifth anniversary , but for the most of between we who are can - be better the history Pubnico , the battle of the Gulf the is déroulée , in fact , in 1942 . 
honourable senators , the ceremony of this morning , Pritchard by His Excellency the Gouverneure general of the Canada , was warm and appropriate and we had among we a great number of submarines of the Shipping Shipping Canadian who have fought in these waters for defend our country . 
the under - submarines German have found that the convoys who traversaient the Atlantic were relatively well protected in 1942 , to the the of the into in War of the Americans and they have then decided of the deal to the Ways navigables coastal of the America of the North for find of the them more easy during this that the turnarounds of the under - submarines German appelaient " the season of whaling American " or " the nice time " . 
honourable senators , the under - submarines German have coulé in six months the long of the Coast of the America of the North of the ships representative 2.5 million of tonnes of goods . 
the seven first months of 1942 have almost cost the War to the Alliés . 
. said that the under - submarines German had so the choice of the targets that they not rentraient to the port that because that they not had more of torpilles . 
then that the battle of the Atlantic was " in high sea , the under - submarines German have succeeded to the stickhandler in the Gulf of the St. - Lawrence , often in view of the coasts , to the research of ships old without escorte . 
in May 1942 , the battle of the Gulf innocently . 
the U - boot German U - 553 was tracked to the broad of the Cape by then that he accomplissait his first aliens . 
, the over of the five months who turbulent , 21 ships were be coulés and few 200 submarines killed . 
in 1944 , two ships of War were coulés and someone 95 people driving . 
the Prime , this was the ship to steamship Nicoya - the Prime at coulé in the waters domestic of the Canada by , I add , of the forces hostile since the War of 1812 . 
unfortunately , this not was not be the last . 
the HMCS Racoon , a bâtiment armé , was coulé by the U - boot U - 165 the 6 September 1942 , and the corvette HMCS Charlottetown by the U - boot U - 517 only five days more later . 
the 14 October , this was the tragedy for the ferry Caribou , who Pedro the Liaison between the part continentale of the Canada and Newfoundland - Newfoundland . 
the the the Speaker : 
senator Forrestall , I regret of duty you interrupt , but the period of three minutes that you substantially for do your statement has expired . 
the senator Forrestall : 
I am course that the honourable senators understand that this are of the Canadians are we which tribute today today . 
the Court Supreme 
the appointment of the hon. Beverley McLachlin to the position of Justice in Leader 
the hon. Joan Fraser : 
honourable senators , I like do few remarks to the about of the announcement made yesterday according which the next Justice in Leader of the Court Supreme of the Canada will Ms the Justice Beverley McLaghlin . 
I think that all the Canadians the are am of this new and I believe that the women were particularly remplies of wear - the expression not is not too strong - to the announcement of his appointment . 
this is the first woman to with the position of Justice in Leader of our Court Supreme . 
this who we pleased particularly , this is that she not has not been appointed to this position because that this was a woman , but in reason of the excellence . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the senator Fraser : 
this is a CIBC quintessencielle . 
can - . be more Canadian that someone a who is unborn to Pincher Creek , in Alberta ? 
she has been admise to the Society albertain in 1969 and she has fact to little close all this that he is possible of do in the system legal Canadian . 
she has one the right in a s private of 1969 to 1975 . 
she has unequal the right to the University of the British - British of 1974 to 1981 , then , in 1981 , she has in to the there of the entirely of the there , to the court of Cork of Vancouver . 
she not is not computer very long in there of the the . 
he there has ten years , in 1989 , she has been appointed to the Court Supreme of the Canada Mr. Mulroney , then Prime Minister - the a of the best decisions that he that taken , challenge - I say . 
her the Justice McLachlin the is disinfection difficult to cataloguer , this who is a something rare . 
he not has not been possible , same to the commentators strongly brought on the questions infuriate , of the geographic as owned to a school judicial or to a other since the announcement made yesterday . 
all the world has simply could say that she was a Justice outside hand , fresher of a spirit an and independent , who not between well heard in no of the Each statute . 
the a of the comments the more interesting that . that facts on she is the of the chairman of the Association of the Society Canadian , who has said : " her has this will Canadian of do the things , of décomposer the problems in grandchildren problems and of the to to the solve . " 
well that I not am not lawyer , I I should to not difficulty of years to read of the kit of jurisprudence and I must say that , in as that former journalist , I me extasie also in wide that we we a Justice in Leader who on the good tradition of write of the judgments of a way simple and clear . 
he is important for the citizens of our country of power understand this that their said the Court Supreme and , when Ms the Justice McLachlin wrote , he not fact no doubt that . includes this that she said and why . 
she has also said recently before the Society Canadian , and I quote : 
the Parliament , with his best tools of child of the facts , with a better access to the opinions , to the information , is the place the more appropriate for the taken of decisions of nature policy , " beyond sense highest " . 
this is very important , I in am some .

Milton Gregg was the a of the 19 Canadians to the be seen spirituality the Cross of Victoria , that he has deserved to Cambrai , in France , to the over of the week of the 28 September to the 1 October 1918 . 
he is sad of think that the enough of the former Veterans of the First War World , of the War War World and of the War of Korea the éclaircissent little to little . 
of after the figures through in March last by the Department of the Affairs Veterans , he rest only 669 former Veterans of the First War World , 390 230 of the War War World and 17 783 of the War of Korea .

question PERIOD PERIOD 
the Defence national 
the Alternative of the helicopters Sea King 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
a other Sea King had of the ennuis with the system hydraulique this week . 
we know that of such ennuis now of be surviving , particularly if the . the find in the airs . 
honourable senators , when the government will he start this bill ? 
can - be the government instead he a way of determining our ships of helicopters a little more quickly ? 
after all , we know that he must replace the equipment , and we know also that the former government was prepared to begin the process as 1993 , before that the new not denies the program of the EH - EH . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank of his question the hon. senator Forrestall , who the concern criticized of the operating of the helicopters Sea King . 
as I the I said to the senators he there has few days , the Alternative of these aircraft remains a priority for the government , and he is to the Prime among of the priorities of the Minister present . 
the fleet of helicopters - the ch - 124 Sea King - has been livrée to the Forces Canadian in 1963 , I believe . 
. the him then and . the is always to this that these aircraft be in service until in 2005 . 
he there has had of the incidents . 
of the problems of maintenance have surgi . 
of the 41 helicopters of the beginning , 30 are always used . 
. is of notice that they can play their role until to this that a other apparatus the is . 
the possible of transfer the investigations on the accidents to the Board of the security of the transport 
the hon. Micheal J . Forrestall : 
the honourable senators not are not without know that that fact now 1 825 days that the government we has promised that he off immediately this program in implement . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate is - he aware that we asking to the young men and to the young women of our Forces Armed Canadian of taxing to on of a apparatus who is far of be Motor ? 
the problem , this is that the aircraft are usés . 
they are fatigués . 
their maintenance we costs a fortune . 
he must 38 p.m. of maintenance and sometimes more for do steal a helicopter during a time . 
the Minister not the makes - he not the that we on in danger the life of the members of our Forces Armed Canadian ? 
the Minister contemplated he the possible of those the responsibility of the investigations on the accidents to the military and of the transfer to the Board Canadian of the security of the transport , who would since of the years , to these helicopters of steal ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the hon. senator has all to fact reason when he described the skills of the members of the Forces Armed Canadian law of the maintenance and particularly of those who the roles of the helicopters Sea King . 
he agree surely with me that those - that listed among the more expérimentés to the world for this who is of this kind of apparatus . 
I not think not that the hon. senator whatever let hear that the forces Armed could send in mission the staff in a apparatus that they not consider not doing and prepared for Canada the mission . 
he there has had and he continue certainly of there have of the challenges to and to the chapter of the maintenance . 
when the term of life useful of a room of equipment military is to his end , the number and the grow of these challenges at . 
that the is happened and that continue of the produce . 
what that he in be , that not to not say that we enverrions of the people in mission if their security and their life were in danger . 
we should recognize the excellent work that the teams relating of the maintenance intelligence and that they continue of accomplish . 
as the hon. senator , I hope that these helicopters will replaced quickly ; of , , he there has few days to only , the Minister me has given the insurance that that remains his priority number a and that he will in so that the matter marshalling to subject allure . 
I will say to the Minister that the senator and me - same the encourageons to deal the question the more quickly possible . 
the senator Forrestall : 
the Leader of the government to the Senate not has not answered to my question . 
my question rest without response . 
let - me of there add a track and I hope that he there will . 
is the second track of my question : the Minister recognizes - he that the work pre to the Alternative of the helicopters bidding had already been work when the Prime Minister present has decided of cancel the program of acquisition of the EH - EH ? 
two years of work have already been accomplies . 
can - we have some assurance ? 
we we whereas eight years and we not can not costs in more a gap of three years , because that this is criticism . 
these helicopters not are not fiables . 
. should the strike of shut of flight . 
the Minister will he also we say this that he think of the proposal according which the monitoring of the performance of these aircraft would Creator to the Board of the security of the transport and not more to the military Canadian ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the senator there two questions . 
he ask of first if I can or not him ensure that the helicopters will replaced before eight years . 
of after this that I can conclude of the about that I I face with the Minister , I am course that we not will not eight years before of replace the Sea King . 
I like succeed to the convince that we not will not to expect still eight years before that the helicopters be replaced . 
the senator has also asked a question to the about of the investigations on the incidents from to the use of the aircraft military . 
frankly , this not is not a area that I know many . 
I think however that in General , the forces Armed of all the country the roles they - same of this kind of activity . 
this not is can - be not necessarily the case and the senator can can - be me enlighten to this about to a time given . 
what that he in be , I not can answer of way specific for the time . 
the Alternative of the fleet of helicopters Sea King - - possible of the credit - lease 
the hon. Gerry Germain : 
honourable senators , my question is supplementary to the questions raised by the senator Forrestall . 
he the find that I I piloté of the had of the Resistance of the air and that I pilot always . 
I the specific for explain this that I will ask to the Minister . 
the government is in are of ask to the employees of the maintenance of do of the miracles . 
I I began my career military in the maintenance before of do part of the staff Aircrew . 
this is the reason for which I know that the préposés to the maintenance are of the excellent work , but they not are not of miracle . 
I I read all recently that a time of flight of these Sea King require 30 p.m. of maintenance . 
he is went until to - and that . me takes if I I wrong - Authorize the turnarounds to not not steal the they thought that the apparatus not was not course . 
when . in is the that , this is last . 
how the Minister has he could the do in as that member of the cabinet ? 
I believe that if a accident declared , the responsibility in incombera fully to the cabinet , particularly to the Minister of the Defence national and to the Prime Minister of the country . 
I believe that he there has of the solutions , as the sublease of helicopters . 
he there amount of aircraft in good of of been in the world who could be used for this service in any security . 
why not optons - we not for this possible ? 
when I I asked this question to the predecessor of the Leader of the government , he has answered that he in had discussed with the Prime Minister and that this solution was to the study . 
I I today to on of a aircraft to four places in company of a other of our senators . 
I I " a attention particular to the question of the security . 
same if the senator had been Liberal , I would " the same attention to the security . 
when I was in the forces air , I I surely piloté of the had to to their on of the Liberal or today in company of Liberal , and I was all also aware of their security . 
honourable senators , I please urge the Minister of study the possible of who of the aircraft and I ask that the . me provide a response to this regard . 
as I the I said , he there has of the million of helicopters . 
in America of the North only , . in find to the least of the thousands . 
why not circuits . not ? 
why people - we our military of the so ? 
the way which we people our military to various other ways is also bid . 
why people - we of the so the turnarounds who at to save of the lives and who , this by , it in calling their own life ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
the hon. senator has raised good number of points and I not chercherai not to answer to each of between them . 
more specifically , in this who respect the helicopter Sea King , the hon. senator has mentioned that my predecessor has had of the discussions with the Minister regarding the possible of approach to the sublease . 
I not I not issue this question with the Minister . 
however , I will certainly try of have a discussion similar with the Minister and I be can - be then in legislation of provide of the information more precise . 
honourable senators , before of repeating my seat , I wish to out that the Forces Armed Canadian work a work remarkable , with the helicopters Sea King or all other apparatus . 
they have been appuyées by the government . 
, my notice , the people who are law of the maintenance of the helicopters Sea King , in more of accomplish a work remarkable , not they never that a aircraft be used the they feel that he is a threat for those who the find to the on . 
the préposés to the maintenance of the helicopters Sea King work a work remarkable in of the circumstances who , must - he the recognize , are difficult , particularly when the . the the of the fact that he the is of old aircraft . 
the agriculture and the agroalimentaire 
the possible of a funds of transition for the farmers who wish change of profession 
the hon. Herber O . Sparrow : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
however , before of the question , I wish of new to him express my thanks and those of the House for have authorized the held of the discussion that we we had yesterday to the about of the crisis agricultural to the Canada . 
I thank all the honourable senators of their contribution to this debate . 
I I thought understand that the Minister of the Agriculture will today today a statement to the House of the Commons on the increase of the budget of the program ACRA . 
I am however a little " before a clause The in the Globe and Mail of today today where . reads that : 
. believes also that the Minister contemplated of create a funds interim for the farmers who decision of abandon to the agriculture and of the recycler . 
I am " because that I not know no organization of farmers and no farmer to asked a such program . 
that me give to think that the government trying of own the farmers to abandon the agriculture . 
this not is not the objective of our very . 
this that we want , this is allow to the farmers of continue of grow the land , not the encourage to the leave . 
when the farmers of the Saskatchewan , of the Manitoba and of the Alberta who the campaigns , the fabric social of this part of the Canada is déchiré . 
he must that all the farmers and all the families of farmers remain that where they are for support the system of the elevators to grain , the system of education and the system of health . 
if the clause said true , I am very " . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate can - he we say if the government and the Minister of the Agriculture at seriously of offer a such program ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the hon. senator . 
for answer to the first part of the question , I say that I not am to the aware of no discussion or of no proposal in this sense during of my talks with the Minister . 
I not can therefore answer to the question of know if the idea has been proposed by a other organization . 
however , as I me paid to the Senate this after - afternoon , . me has has a release of the Minister of the Agriculture and of the Agroalimentaire who outlining the details of the offer made by the Minister . 
I I asked to my staff of me you the version bilingual of the announcement to that the senators so in take knowledge . 
I the the receive under little . 
if such is the good happy of the honourable senators , I their remettrai of the copies of this announcement . 
the announcement not fact of or of program of buy or of other provisions of this nature . 
this amount the add to the someone higher million of $ paid to the as of Payments federal annual to the farmers . 
of more , of other changes to the guideline of Administration of the program are to the study . 
in all case , . for that the first ministers provincial who are came to Ottawa recently for express their concerns to this regard the joindront to the government federal for to the program ACRA many more accessible . 
I i that the provinces continue of adhérer to the rule current of the sharing of the costs based , who the fact on the basic of 60 / 40 in they the of these 170 million of $ deprive . 
in this case - that , the funds the Gustafson determining of a other amount considerable . 
the ask of a program of keeping of the farmers on their Lands 
the hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , I I a question supplementary regarding the keeping of the farmers on their Lands . 
, the time current , he not rest more that 2.5 per of the people Canadian in the sector of the agriculture . 
he is therefore very important of the there maintain . 
, the States - United , the chairman Clinton has said that he has decided of sign a such legislation because that the farmers are face to a real situation of emergency and not can not expect . 
the legislation provided a amount of 8,7 billion of $ for the farmers American . 
the chairman of the Syndicat national of the farmers has said that this infusion of assistance can do the difference between abandon and stay in Affairs . 
the important , this is of keep the farmers in agriculture . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate would - he the please of to that to the cabinet ? 
we we been happy of learn that . had taken some measures for infuser more of capital in the situation . 
I think that this is far of be sufficient , the given the so serious of the situation to which we do opposite . 
however , the Leader could - he we ensure that he African the government to tough a program for keep the farmers in agriculture rather that of the help to the abandon ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I not I no difficulty to say that the . should do all this who is expectation possible for keep the farmers in agriculture , where they continue of to a contribution to the life and to the society Canadian as they the have fact to the over of the years . 
I like simply so a part of the release of press who just of me , . 
the Minister of the Agriculture and of the Agroalimentaire said : " We will to the provinces of the associate to we , in the framework of the program ACRA , for cover 70 per of the marges negative of the producers or about of the measures imports . " 
by , , the Minister of the Agriculture and of the Agroalimentaire has said that we will continue to work with the provinces and the sector agricultural for find of the ways of come in assistance to the farmers , particularly those who are the more in difficulty . 
this statement said without no doubt that a commitment of the government federal there and that he is informed of are important for come in assistance to those who are the more in difficulty and who now the more of have to leave their land . 
I me forward to this that this legislation will the effect désiré by the hon. senator . 
the Minister of the Agriculture and of the Agroalimentaire deserves of be helpfulness of be past to the action without expect a solution négociée with the provinces . 
in an immediately this money in the program , the Minister and the government federal réagissent of way very direct and very active . 
. i that the provinces their emboîteront the not and these to the aspire of the ACRA . 
the government federal and the Minister not have however not wanted do traîner the things during a week , wavered days , ten days , a months and not have not whereas of have a guarantee written to this effect . 
the Minister has responded immediately . 
this money will improve the operating of the program . 
he will , to the farmers which the needs are the more great and who now the more of leave their Lands . 
the Program of assistance in case of disaster linked to the income agricultural - - expense of funds additional - Request of confusion of the statement of the Minister 
the hon. Herbert O . Sparrow : 
honourable senators , the Leader to - he say that the new funds will paid before the former ? 
is - this that this that he to say when he said that the things of more quickly ? 
the farmers not have not still received the former funds are they have right in under of the program ACRA and now , . does say that the new funds their will paid more quickly ? 
I me ask if the Leader of the government to the Senate could rapporter the message following to the Minister , to know that for these new funds , we not we not really need of a other accompany of 47 pages . 
we in we enough of the former ; we item someone something of more simple . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the government has recognized that the funds who were some in the framework of the program ACRA not were not paid enough quickly to the beneficiaries . 
I I listened the excellent intervention that the senator Carstairs has made yesterday in this House . 
she has clear and in any candeur underlined the problems that possession the program . 
the money not was not paid to the farmers in the need also quickly that the government federal and the other parties to the agreed ACRA the had wanted . 
he not was not paid to the farmers also quickly that the concepteurs of the program the had wanted . 
the use of these new funds will set to the same rules . 
the funds of in the same garbage . 
the Minister has however also announced that some changes would Regional to the program , through are he is to hope that the farmers receive this money many more quickly . 
the hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , in under of the former program , in the case of a average of three years of a farmer , the he has grêlé a year and that then the drought has sévi a or two years of the , the 70 per of this average on three years not suffiraient personally not . 
the Minister could - he do understand to his colleagues of the cabinet to what point he is important of help the farmers which the needs are the more criants ? 
the they have been victims of pots or of hailed , 70 per of two years bad not riment to nothing . 
this are these people who have the more suffered ; this are these people who in have the more need . 
for that the program be effective , of the changes the do for to a term to these suffering . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the problem has can - be been corrected . 
I paraphrase to new the release . 
I know if this change made a solution to the problem raised by the senator , but he allows of believe that a assistance is the for the situations that he we has conducted . 
honourable senators , that he me be for of table the release . 
I just of the receive in the two languages official and I will do of the copies additional for the senators who the wish . 
the the the Speaker : 
the leave is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the the the Speaker : 
we in will of the copies and the distribuerons as that they will ready . 
the ask of assistance financial in favour of the déshydrateurs of luzerne 
the hon. Nicholas W . Taylor : 
honourable senators , I I a question supplementary . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate can - he inform the cabinet of the problem that are the déshydrateurs of luzerne of the Western , who get their Hempline with of the farmers ? 
they are in difficulty , because they had promised to the farmers as of $ the would and they must the sell least sir . 
he the is primarily of small companies , sometimes of the Cooperatives . 
few dozens of between they in the west of the Canada will probably bankrupt , because the Minister of the Agriculture has determined that they were in effect of the companies and that they not were therefore not eligible to the program ACRA . 
yet , if they are bankrupt , a sure number of farmers not will more sell their luzerne . 
same the he the is that of very small businesses , they justified of the jobs . 
since the program ACRA not is of no assistance to this regard , I hope that the Leader of the government to the Senate can to their problem to the cabinet and know the he there a other way of the help to the over of the two or three next years and of keep open the déshydrateuses of luzerne . 
after all , the farmers in have greatly need . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I know grateful to the senator of the comments that he has made to this about . 
I me will a happy of to his concerns to the cabinet , including to the Minister appropriate . 
the fisheries and the Oceans 
the provinces marine - - decision of the Court Supreme confirmant the rights of fishing aboriginal - - effects on the economy local 
the hon. Gerald J . Comeau : 
honourable senators , my question the on a about little different , be the decision that the Court Supreme has made recently in the case Marshall . 
little any the way which . can consider this decision , the most of the people suitable that she will of deep impact on the life of the aboriginal and of the other Canadians of the region of the Atlantic . 
in addition , the measures of Standards will of the consequences for the economy and the Finance of all the Canada . 
I will mention his consequences future for the gas of the Island of Sable , the rights of cutting and the rights minerals , and and of the . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate could - he say what measures and what plans of emergency are now the in implement for do opposite to the ajustements economic and to the impact of the judgment of the Court Supreme ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , as . the knows very well , the decision Marshall has of first had for effect immediate of create a crisis in the fisheries to the Canada Atlantic . 
the priority of the Minister of the Fisheries and of the government has been of try of unconventional the situation to the more quickly in the hope of bring the was and of promote the held of talks between the two parties of manner to find a solution sustainable to a problem who has of the impact very serious to short term . 
some stages which we we been witnesses we have all the difficulty to the comfortable , I in am sure . 
the process of negotiating to short term seems be well established . 
the was seems restored and we we good hope of do current the talks . 
he not can be tenure only by the fishermen of the Canada Atlantic , not more of , that by the employees of office of Vancouver . 
this is all the country who must ensure the regulation , in recognition of the rights aboriginal such that définis by the Court Supreme . 
I me forward to this that this be a process to long term . 
however , in the sectors where he must as now find a solution , including in the fisheries of the Atlantic , I think that . has fact of the excellent work and I hope that . continue in this vein . 
the possible of a further of transition for the fishermen that change of profession 
the hon. Gerald J . Comeau : 
honourable senators , I not I not could do other that out the question that the senator Sparrow has raised more earlier to the about of the programs of Standards who are Softwood or of the about according which of such programs would Softwood for the sector agricultural . 
various sources argue that of the are have been for for a so of program of Standards - I not parlance not the word " buy " . 
I I heard speak of 500 million of $ - I believe have indeed eight zéros after the five - who would paid only for the sector agricultural . 
this is that a amount enormous . 
the same kind of approach is - he arisen for the fisheries - in of other words , contemplated . of up the for of some people of the sector of the fisheries and of other sectors , this who ajoutera of other zéros to the amount - or is - this simply a rumour who about ? 
I remind to the Minister that he there has now many of uncertainty in of many communities . 
the fishing of Winter , a fishing very limited , will soon begin . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I not can confirm no figure based on of the conjectures . 
I would very surprised that of the figures have been advanced to this at . 
a of the reasons is including that . not knows not still any the scope of the judgment Marshall - the application , his issue and story . 
someone share , in the maze government , someone a échafaude can - be all they of scenarios , but I doubt that of the figures have been seriously Softwood to this at . 
he is possible that a buy the matérialise to a sure at . 
, comments , honourable senators , I not can not confirm - well to the contrary - of the about of this kind to the about of the farmers . 
I not am to the aware of no program of buy of the farmers . 
I not want not deceiving the Senate in mistake to this regard . 
however , the situation is little different in the case of the fisheries . 
a program of buy is already in into . 
in fact , he there a program aboriginal of buy in the framework which . redeem of the for in some sectors of the fisheries for the back to the community aboriginal . 
this program there already before the judgment Marshall , and he is to little close course that he the shall under a some form . 
I underscored to new with of the senator : the situation there a challenge not only to the fishermen of the New - Brunswick or of the Nova - Nova , but to all the Canada . 
order orders OF 
the business of the Senate 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I ask to the Clerk of call in Prime the second point to the order of the day , under the Order of the " Projets of bill " , to know , the second Reading of the Bill bill C - 6 . 
bill of bill on the protection of the information personal and the documents electronic 
second Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
- honourable senators , I am happy of have the opportunity of speak to the Senate of the bill of bill C - 6 , which the as abrégé is Act on the protection of the information personal and the documents electronic . 
with the arrived of the new economy of the information , the Canadians find of new ways of to between them , with the markets , with the governments and the world world . 
all the Canadians have a interest in the new economy of the know who system of the changes who touch profoundly all our lives . 
the success of the Canada to the st century depend of the ability of all the Canadians of participate with success to the economy World of the know . 
for ensure this participation , we we act quickly to of give to the Canadians the access and the skills necessary and of their ensure that this new Technology not minera in nothing the respect of the information personal which they can now fact . 
the Bill bill C - 6 , the Act on the protection of the information personal and the documents electronic , is a not important in the too of these objectives . 
honourable senators , the bill of bill C - 6 is the result of a review enlightened by of many experts in the area of the protection of the data and of the trade Ministerial , of consultation public broader and of a review thorough to the other place . 
he will submitted to of intense hearings by a committee Standing of the Senate . 
the bill of bill the attack to three questions broader for help the Canadians to well operating the true potential of the Internet as médium of information and way of nothing . 
the bill of bill will , first , create a solution of alternative Ministerial for deal with the government federal ; second , establish a sat legal for the issues electronic and of the signatures electronic seemingly ; third , protect the information personal of the Canadians when they deal with of the businesses private . 
the government federal has been the a of the first to use the system Internet for improve the services that he practice to the Canadians , all in accroissant the effectiveness and in reducing the costs . 
good number of the transactions Conducted by the government federal with of the public , of the transmission of the statements of income to the research of information on a variety of issues , can now be Conducted of way Ministerial , and this of way many more quick and least little that we . 
however , . could do many for from profit of all this that the Internet has to we offer if . modifiait the laws and regulations federal in into . 
good number of our laws and regulations explicitly that the information must be sent by wrote or that some documents must to a signing . 
these provisions can be interprétées , and the are often , as require a transaction manuelle on paper , empêchant as during the point to of the practices electronic . 
the bill of bill C - 6 we allows of to our laws and regulations consistent with our new Environment Ministerial . 
he we will of offer a solution of alternative to the transmission of information on support paper . 
the parties 2 to 5 of the bill of bill C - 6 taxation the itself - saying party taken for the support paper in our laws and regulations federal in by essentially people this concept of support . 
other said , the laws and regulations reconnaîtrons now the detour and information electronic on the same at that the documents suffice . 
the bill of bill C - 6 make the transactions Conducted on support Ministerial to the words of the laws federal imports to those Conducted on paper . 
the citizens and the businesses will then be some that the documents and signatures electronic have the same value legal . 
the bill of bill C - 6 not remplacera not and not eliminate not the Communications by wrote . 
he will rather of the transmission Ministerial of data by computer a option to the time realistic , practice and particularly whose to the level legal . 
of more , we us to the government federal of offer of the services under a form who becomes of more in more popular with of the Canadians , be by seaway Ministerial , to the way of Internet . 
the Canadians want more that never do of the transactions electronic , not only with their governments , but also with the sector private . 
well of the evidence come the confirm , from of the results of surveys of opinion to the number of transactions now Conducted on Internet and to the rate of growth of these transactions . 
in reason of the presence of the networks and of the track increased to which the are in this area the progress technological , the businesses stood of more in more of information from of sources of more in more various , the échangent more quickly , the transmettent more far and the combinent of way more ingénieuse that never . 
that has into the treatment of the information personal in a well . 
the information personal are now " , sold and échangés . 
they have a some value commercial . 
for that fleurisse the trade Ministerial to the Canada , the consumers must be " on the way which their information personal are collected , sauvegardés and used . 
the Canadians are that their life privacy not be danger by the popularity growing of the transactions electronic and that the Capacity of the information and of the fichiers accumulés on each of between we . 
they want that the government working with the businesses for deal this problem . 
according the results of a poll of the delaying Angus Reid diffusés in July 1998 , 88p. per of the Canadians find " for " that the businesses and the organizations vendent , échangent or shared of the understaffed enclosing of the information personal . 
the community of the Affairs has recognized the malaise that that could create and has adopted a Code volunteer of the protection of the information personal public by the Association Canadian of normalisation . 
same if the efforts been by the businesses for respect this Code are biodegradable , the Canadians have need of best guarantees to of have the certainty that their life privacy is protégée when they are of the transactions . 
the bill of bill C - 6 guarantees to the Canadians that their life privacy will protégée in providing a Code of protection of the information personal to the time being and required . 
, the time current , the information personal facing all the boundaries , provincial , land and national . 
however , the given that the bill of bill C - 6 is around on the world of the Affairs , the government federal believes that he will a year legitimate of the power of regulatory of the trade to the Canada . 
however , honourable senators , the committee which this bill of bill is referred further of the evidence of experts who will point of the arguments for and against to the about of this question constitutional . 
honourable senators , he is clear necessary of adopt of the laws national . 
the provinces , that they act only or collectively , not can adopt of the laws may of protect effectively the information who franchit the line provincial and international . 
a business of the British - British recueillant of the information on of the customers to the Manitoba could the book to a other business to the New - Brunswick or to New York . 
he is therefore clear that the Canada has need of a bill national for protect the data personal in such circumstances - of a bill who would Abolition with those of the provinces and of the territories acted their role in their face of jurisdiction . 
honourable senators , the bill of bill C - 6 will the apply to all the sectors of activity , regardless of the size of the businesses . 
that includes also the sector of the health . 
he will allow of protect the information personal in the of health who have been collected , used and releases in the framework of activities trade . 
for that the rules on the protection of the data conflict of a juridiction to the other , the government encourage the provinces and the territories to protect the data of the citizens in their face of jurisdiction and to the harmonize not only with the bill federal on the protection of the information personal , but also between them . 
the part 1 of the bill of bill C - 6 establishes the right to the protection of the information personal . 
she states the rules who must govern the Clinic , the use and the communication of the information personal in the framework of activities trade . 
the principles out in the standard of the CSA have relates to the way which the organizations should to , use , book and protect the information personal . 
they indiscriminately that the businesses must explain the for which the information are collected ; obtain of the particular the consent of to the information ; use and book of the information personal ; and understand of the measures Motion the access to the issues and providing the responsibility of the organization . 
this is the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy of the Canada who will responsible of superviser the enforcement of the part 1 of the bill . 
he will responsible of do inquiry and of play the role of médiateur in case of dispute and that of do inquiry in the case of the complaints . 
, my notice , the committee want including discuss of the rules necessary for ensure to this that the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy , in the year of his roles of investigator and of médiateur , respect the lines guidelines fully of various decisions complete by the Court Supreme , there including the decision regarding the powers in the of delving , of perquisition and of back of the former Act Current to the investigations on the coalitions in report with the case of the Edmonton Journal . 
this is clearly that a aspect on which the committee want the look . 
the differences not solved can be broader in the framework of this bill in the showing before the Court federal for that she educate submission the question . 
the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy the see also credit a very mandate in the of education of the public , be help the businesses to satisfy to the requirements of the bill . 
, the time current to the Canada , . can say that the protection of the information personal is sporadique and inégale . 
the majority of the industries not are absolutely not held of respect someone rule that this be regarding the cueillette , the use and the disclosure of the information personal . 
the other are covered to this that the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy of the Canada has called a " organizes " of laws , of regulations and of codifies . 
he not there has that the province of Quebec who has a bill of broader scope for the use of the information personal by the sector private . 
the businesses Canadian looking also that be agreed a legislation legislative who fixerait a only together of rules national to of addressed the rules of the stake to the the of the country and of the various types of businesses . 
the businesses Canadian they that the protection of the life privacy has of the good sense on the plan of the Affairs . 
they understand that a bill flexible , but effective will to convince the customers of accept the trade Ministerial and , therefore , to increase the volume of the Affairs . 
the Canada has need of a new bill for protect the life privacy . 
this bill must ensure a sure balance . 
of a share , he there has the right of the human of exercise a control on his information personal , and he must give to the consumers of the point effective the they feel that . in has fact a use brings . 
of other share , the bill must answer to the needs of the industry , who must to and use of the information personal , this who is a part vital to the success in the economy of the information . 
honourable senators , I believe that the bill of bill C - 6 , which we are before , assure the good balance . 
he will to build the confidence of the so all in instaurant the rules who limited to the community of the Affairs the climate of certainty which he has need for operating to further the potential of the trade Ministerial and and help to do of the Canada a Leader of leadership in the trade Ministerial and the area of the information . 
I I forward of take share to the study of this bill of bill to the committee . 
I urge urge all the senators to take share to this study and to refer the bill of bill C - 6 the more quickly possible to the committee . 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I hear do of the comments enough étoffées on the bill of bill , after what I move the adjournment of the debate . 
several people and organizations have expressed of the concern to the about of this bill of bill . 
I trying of take of the provisions for the meet to the beginning of the week next , if possible . 
I think in particular to of the representatives of the sector of the health . 
I not like not complete my comments to the step of the second Reading without hear their point of view . 
after the adjournment of the debate , I me move of complete my intervention to our return , after the break of the day of the Souvenir . 
I attention also to the honourable senators that to the least a other colleague of this side - this , the senator Oliver , does participate to the debate of second Reading . 
in reality , the bill of bill so two measures in a only . 
her the Minister of the Justice has she - same influencing , when she has appeared before the committee of the Commons , that he there had to the departure two bills of bill separate , this that the officials have confirmed . 
, the over of the study to the cabinet , someone a is came with of the ciseaux and a although of glue and has decided of in do a only text . 
the part 1 plan the information personal who are collected to of the for trade . 
the parties 2 to 5 veilleront to this that the documents and the tactical electronic be consistent with the Act on the evidence to the Canada , the Act on the Statutory regulatory , the Act on the review of the laws , and and of the . 
this legislation facilitera the trade Ministerial with the government of the Canada . 
the part 1 and the parties 2 to 5 not the limit not to a principle or to a theme in particular . 
this bill of bill is in effect a bill of bill omnibus . 
this is the of the hon. Herb Gray , who spoke then to the behalf of the Opposition to the opportunity of the debate on the free - Exchange to the House of the Commons in 1988 . 
is his comments : 
the Main advantage of a procedure omnibus , this is that the bill of bill in question , well that he is to establish or to amend several laws disparates , based on a principle or a objective who creates a link between all the laws proposed , by and the bill of bill intelligible in the context Parliamentary . 
however , this bill of bill " not framework not " , as . said , with this definition . 
the - this is very concise . 
several portrait the have resuming by the the , the considering as a excellent definition of this that should be a good bill omnibus . 
the bill of bill C - 6 not is not a good bill omnibus . 
he based on two themes , two principles different . 
be said in any charities and in they the of the problems are were face the editors , this attempt of invent a principle or a theme then that he not in is nothing not has nothing of very performance . 
this is all to fact déloyal . 
is still of the pirouettes legal and phone . 
the first part of the bill of bill , regarding the protection of the information personal , the on the information personal collected of someone way that this be , by of the ways electronic or all other way . 
the long as , in tâchant of give a principle unique or a theme unique to the bill of bill - I the say still a time in a spirit charitable - is a wonderful absurdité that the editors we have concoctée . 
the senator Stewart me has accused he there has few years of have the spirit of a mandarin . 
I not think not that this be true . 
same if this the was in part , I me inclinerais certainly before the senator Kirby , because I not would same not in the same ligue that him to this regard . 
however , I think have learning enough of experience for understand someone something to the spirit mandarin and same to the spirit policy . 
, a time given , someone a is came and has said : " As we not we that as of time Parliamentary to our clause , collons these two bills of bill together . " 
then . procéda , électroniquement well course , to the cut - slipped . 
this is and that the bill of bill has been set . 
this is always the same because , the same ground , to know the convenience of the executive to which the prerogatives of the Parliament have been again and again time subordonnées since 30 years and who , to my humble notice , has into the House of the Commons in a real coquille vacuum . 
this is very regrettable . 
I not know not very well if we , of this side - this , should continue this question . 
of a side , I me say that we must really take Position on of the things of this kind , by principle . 
of a other side , I me say that to the other place , he the is past so of time that they have same forgotten in what could well leaving their prerogatives and that , the they not the in soucient not , why should - we we in knowing ? 
I will however benefit of the opportunity for consult my colleagues to of determine if , to a at ultérieur of the debate , we want continue the question . 
the senator Graham the recall certainly of the many examples of bills of bill divided by the Senate . 
when I at of the side first and that I was responsible of the ACOA , I had presented a bill of bill to to create this agency and of other agencies , which the Corporation of development of the Cape - Cape . 
he there had of the provisions who the regroupaient very well , but my friend the senator Graham and the Leader of the party to the time , the senator MacEachen , had some reserves . 
a message has been sent to the House of the Commons for him do know that we had divided the bill of bill in two , and the rest . 
I wanted out that , honourable senators , same if this not is that to as informatif , because that he the is of a question of principle . 
the bill of bill was the bill of bill C - 54 during of the first session of the , Parliament . 
he is death to the Paper to the step of the report to the time of the prorogation and has been ressuscité to the beginning of this new session . 
this that I I to say on the bill of bill C - 6 and on the evidence heard by the committees has relates in great part to the deliberations on the bill of bill C - 54 . 
of after this that I I could see , the parties 2 to 5 , be the parties on the trade Ministerial , not reviewers no objection of principle . 
the controversy , if I can really speak of controversy , just particularly of the part 1 , on the protection of the life privacy . 
that example the problems who where when the . wants of souder two bills of bill . 
he the could very well that the witnesses , the other parties interested and the legislators of the other place have " too little of attention to the parties 2 to 5 . God knows that these parties are important . 
they ambulances , between other , to the system judicial , be the courts , the right , the statements under oath and the rest . 
he the could that , since the part 1 prepared more to controversy , the parties 2 to 5 have been examined in greater only as by the parties interested that by the legislators . 
I the said , this is that a problem a of up when . based two bills of bill in a only . 
in this who respect the part 1 , and my comments of today today the limiteront for the most to this part , that he me be for of express my great préjugé favourable . 
I am a very advocate of the protection of the life privacy . 
that is indissociable of the dignity of the individual . 
the Act on the protection of the life privacy protects the individual against any they to his life privacy who would the fact of the government federal or of the a of his agencies . 
this bill is effective . 
, this that I far , she the has always been . 
we not had not before today today of bill for protect the information personal collected in a context commercial . 
I commend the government of have filled this deficiency . 
he in was time and I there support without contingency . 
I can hope that he will the the of the support that we comptons to to this initiative - I believe power speak to the behalf of the senators of this side - this of the House - and that all this that I speak say to the about , who would a of to for of the criticism , will perceived to the favour of our agreed with this text who protects the information personal collected to of the for trade . 
, this regard , I not see not of generates , to the contrary of some people , to this that the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy jouisse of some powers . 
I not believe not that these powers be inordinate . 
I believe that the life privacy of the individual any to a point such that the Parliament must go until - that , the he the must , for the protect . 
I be in way that the structure of the bill of bill has fact the subject of some criticism . 
the Printed 1 she - same contains a combination of the aspects obligatoires - this who must be fact - and of the aspects are - this who can and should be fact . 
the lawyers who have examined carefully this bill of bill and who have prepared of the findings written on this about have should that this would very difficult and that this that the . would should do , and that the . should always do , would of include all the provisions obligatoires action in this Printed in the body of the bill , not bearing that the aspects possible or are in the Printed . 
I raises the question to the intention of the committee . 
if that can allow of improve the bill of bill , as better . 
. has fact of the representations to the House réclamant a exemption general . 
I not taken not many of kind of ask . 
he is possible however , in some areas , and the of the health me just immediately to the spirit , that the . can ask a treatment particular in under of the bill , and I there will more later . 
as I the I already said , I not am not very favourable to this kind of ask of exemption . 
in fact , I not am not sure of be of agreed with some of the exemptions already domain in the bill of bill to the time current . 
I like all particularly draw your attention on the ( 4 ( 2 ) c ) to the part 1 , who for that this part not the applies not : 
... to a organization to the regard of the information personal that she recueille , using or report to of the for are , arts or littéraires and to no other end . 
I speak of first of the for arts or littéraires . 
of what the is - he ? 
that not you seems he not be a definition extremely civil ? 
I believe that she the is . 
can - . the make a little ? 
we should to all the least try . 
when the question has been raised during the study of the committee of the House of the Commons , he has been underlined to the over of a statement that without this exemption , the comrades could be contrary to the bill . 
you know this that are the comrades , honourable senators . 
they understand a mixture of facts and of fiction . 
they are interesting to look , but they should can - be be regulated by a bill of this kind . 
. not should can - be not the exempt systematically . 
I believe that the question deserves of be thorough . 
for this who is of the exemption regarding the information personal collected to of the for are , the reason for which this exemption is the is very simple : if she not there not and that this bill of bill was adopted , he would challenged , and very probably with success , in under of the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms in sections the right of the express , the freedom of press . 
this is probably true . 
however , that raises a question in my spirit : why the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms not for - she not the protection of the right to the life privacy , this who put this right on the same plan that the rights debates to the freedom of the press ? 
I think that he is regrettable that the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms not prévoie not a such protection . 
let - me of give to the honourable senators few information of order historic . 
he there has long of that , in 1979 , the government Trudeau , by the through of the Minister of the Justice of then , Mr. Jean tien , prit the commitment , in a statement of principles constitutional , that the right to the life privacy would the a of the rights that the government federal proposerait of of in a future Charter of the rights and freedoms . 
when the opportunity was came of the do during the period who has led to the Constitution of 1982 , this same government , réincarné under a form different after 1980 , the is cake . 
Mr. . tien was of new Minister of the Justice . 
the honourable senators the recall that a committee Joint of the House of the Commons and of the Senate has examined the bill of canadianisation of the Constitution and , more particularly , the array of the Charter of the rights and freedoms . 
the chairmen were the senator Harry Hays , the father of our colleague , and Serge Joyal , who was then member . 
the members Conservatives and NDP - Conservative of the committee prirent the initiative of propose that the right to the life privacy be recorded in the Charter . 
the senator Kirby the in recall . 
Mr. . tien the there opposa . 
the argument was that the concept of life privacy was too civil . 
in addition , he was of notice that the life privacy would enough protégée by the clause 7 , who the on the security of the human , and by the clause 8 , regarding the confiscation , the perquisitions and the saisies " , of the Charter . 
what that he in be , the initiative of the Conservatives and of the NDP - Conservative was defeated , to wrong , I think . 
in the negotiations of 1992 who have avid to the Agreement of Charlottetown , the present Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy , Mr. Bruce Phillips , is spoken and has asked , with many of to - comments , that a amendment be made to the Charter for that she garantisse the right to the life privacy . 
in their wisdom , the first ministers not the have not fact . 
. said sometimes that we are protected by the laws on the diffamation . 
he would that of the people more paid in the right that me analysent this deal , but all this that I can in think , this is that the media can papers or according any the information that they the wish on not any who , portion that she be true . 
be said in way , honourable senators , in a long clause The in the edition of the Globe and Mail of this morning , . spoke of the efforts that are the historians for cancel the commitment that Sir Wilfrid Laurier had spent in the bill for protect the data of the census . 
I know that the senator Milne has a opinion to this about . 
number of historians want to the with on of the data personal who have been communiquées under the Excellency of the confidentiality to the recenseurs since 1906 , I believe . 
the historians would drew that he would rise this restriction . 
Mr. . Phillips , Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy , says also drew that he not would not the rise . 
let - me of say that I am of agreed Mr. Phillips . 
if my great - father or my back - great - father have release of the information personal to the recenseur on the faith of the commitment taken by Sir Wilfrid Laurier , I believe that he would respect this commitment . 
as the hon. senator the has fact out , to the Canada , he is inexorable that a bill of bill of this kind raises of the questions Constitutional , in the sense classic of the questions on the Division of the powers and that of the questions federal - provincial who are more of order administrative . 
on the question constitutional , the opinions expressed will of a so to the other , be of the application appropriate of the power Liberal in the of trade until to the deal that that the bill of bill strictly far beyond - beyond of the skills of the Parliament federal . 
my opinion of layman , that . will for this that she worth , this who not is not many , 1 to the that has position the senator Kirby . 
I am of notice that this bill of bill for a application appropriately and legitimate of the power federal in the of trade ; of , , the senator Kirby has statement with to - comments , as only can the do a layman , some of the reasons who the follows . 
I add that to my notice , the government federal not should not hesitate , as the governments the have fact in the past , to point this power in the of trade . 
the existence is valid . 
faithful to the usual , the Association of the Society Canadian has presented a testimony little useful before the committee of the House of the Commons . 
by out that some legal had said the legislation vires vires , that of other the had judged perfectly consistent to the powers who we headed and that of other still had some a opinion the much between the two first , the Association of the Society Canadian made that all these were were can to the words of the Constitution . 
the Association of the Society Canadian the the dérobée , I think that the committee should , as the has proposed the senator Kirby , examine to further this question . 
we must the study seriously . 
we should hear the experts . 
I believe that we able we address to the senators who have more of knowledge and of experience that me in the constitutional . 
they agreeable can - be same to amend the opinion that we we , the senator Kirby and me , on this question , but I in doubt . 
the Quebec is the only province who protects really the information personal collected to of the for trade . 
the Quebecers benefit of a double protection since he there a chapter of the Code Civil of the Quebec who protects the information personal in more of a Act on the protection of the information personal . 
the senator Kirby not the has not mentioned , then I the am . 
during the three first years after the Assent Royal , after the Recognition , this bill the apply only to the activities trade who matters of the government federal and to the trade interprovincial . 
this is not is that after three years that she the apply to the activities trade to the within of a province , and only if this province not has not adopted of bill same . 
. the ask why the government the give all this difficulty , the the of the assertion firm of the power in the of trade , but I believe that this is with to the fact that the Quebec has already a bill and that the Alberta would in are of in prepare a . 
I add that the ministers provincial of the Justice have all asked that this bill of bill be withdrawn . 
as I the I said , I believe that this is go too far . 
in more of the question constitutional , . has raised the problem of the doubt and of the confusion who can régner in the provinces who have their own bill , as the Quebec . 
we will then the bill federal , who the apply to the activities trade relevant of the federal and to the trade interprovincial , and the bill provincial , who the apply to the activities trade to the within of the province . 
he will can - be more difficult that . the think of do the distinction between these various activities . 
that is - this who is interprovincial and that is - this who is intraprovincial ? 
what bill the apply , the bill federal or the bill provincial ? 
he risk of there have of the difficulties administrative , of the ambiguïtés and of the équivoques . 
the problems administrative can always be surmontés . 
the senator Kirby , a mandarin , effort certainly this assertion , but the ministers provincial , as I the I said , have asked that the bill of bill be withdrawn , and I believe that they should be heard for that . attempts of the assure or , if this is possible , of answer to their concerns . 
the senator Kirby has spoke of the sector of the care of health . 
Mr. . Manley , the Minister of the Industry , who has sponsored this bill of bill to the other place , believes that he has answered to the concerns expressed to the way of a amendment that he has présentéle 15 October , if I not me read . 
of after the information that I I , the representatives of the sector of the care of health who have expressed of such concerns not are not of the all convinced that . has there answered . 
the Association dental Canadian has adopted a Position enough firm to this regard . 
this not is can - be not as the case of the doctors and of the hospitals , but they have all presented of the you and we we hear this that they have to say during of the study of the bill of bill in committee . 
the Association Canadian of the care of health is particularly concern to this about . 
the relations doctor - patient not are not of nature " commercial " , according the definition used in this bill of bill , or those can - be with the pharmacies and of other pourvoyeurs of care of health . 
the Association Canadian of the care of health has from a notice legal very detailed and , I say , very dévastateur . 
he just of a s of lawyers of Montreal and the human who has wrote the letter of " has taken the only of do out that the lawyers who had worked to this question had all he , to as of volunteers , of important positions in of the hospitals and of the associations of care of health , and cetera . 
the senators who the interested to this bill of bill , and particularly who have the intention of take share to the study of this bill of bill in committee , must absolutely read this notice legal . 
I not am not of agreed with those who think that we should simply exclude the care of health and the sector of the care of health . 
, my notice , we should reconsidered the possible of give to this important sector a place special in the bill . 
as I the I said , I I the intention , personally or by the through of my members , of their speak and of listen this that they have to say . 
I will on this question when I call end to my remarks , the 16 November . 
after these remarks préliminaires , honourable senators , I move the adjournment of the debate . 
( on the motion of the senator Murray , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the Act on the stopped judicial 
bill of bill Amend - Second Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
he the is of a bill of bill important , the given that he with of the improvement of the security of our children and of the of other people vulnerable . 
however , he so that we we in the obligation of study a great number of measures legislation important . 
he worth therefore the only of bye the major elements and objectives of the bill of bill . 
of first and before all , the changes will for effect of increase the security of the public . 
they features accessible , for end of review to the over of the filtrage , the stopped judicial of the offenders sexual who benefit of a preventative and who the them candidates to of the positions stipulates a situation of confidence . 
and , a " indicateur " will put in the system of the casiers court when a offender body will the subject of a preventative and that the matter will scellé . 
that means that when a body who the ' of children want know the background of new employees , volunteers or paid , the background of a candidate who has already made a offence of nature sexual and to who has been granted a preventative , not from not inaperçus . 
little of things are also troublantes that the idea that those who the attack to of the children innocent can find found in a organization where these children should the feel in security and protected . 
we know yet that that is already came . 
the bill of bill add a weapon to our arsenal for help to prevent these incidents . 
in addition , the bill of bill will four things . 
all of first , he make more clear and aquatic the system of preventative in providing the repeal immediate of the preventative as that he there will condemnation for this that . Order a offence Joint , this is - to - say a offence who can be - be by seaway of implementation in charge , be by seaway of statement summary of about . 
second , the candidate who the is seen refuse the preventative will expect to the least a year before of power present a new ask . 
third , the calls to the commission in case of refusal or of repeal the will normally by wrote only , to least that the Board national of the libérations conditional not would a hearing . 
fourth , the bill of bill indiquera more clear that the preventative has for effect of sceller the matter and not of effacer the fact that he there has had condemnation . 
well that all these measures be important in they - same , I like me focus primarily on the question of the preventative of the offenders sexual . 
the Act on the stopped judicial establishes a system of preventative for the former offenders who have demonstrated that they menaient now a life rangée . 
in under of this bill , the stopped judicial of the offenders can be scellé the they get their preventative with of the Board national of the libérations conditional . 
he any of not not forget that the scellage not efface not the condemnation , not more that he not purge the stopped judicial . 
the condemnation is after all a fact valve . 
the stopped judicial can be réouvert on the ask of the Solicitor General , when this is in the interest of the justice or of the security national . 
honourable senators , the preventative not is not granted easily . 
she the is only if a human has fact evidence of a conduct irréprochable and not has not perpétré of crime during a period constitutes . 
in the case of offences punissables on statement summary of about , he is necessary of do evidence of a conduct irréprochable during three years , after have purgé his only . 
the bill of bill C - 7 specific clear that that includes the payment of amendes . 
in the case of actions criminals more serious , the period of Awaiting is of five years . 
the Board national of the libérations conditional must confirm that the claimants has fact evidence of a conduct irréprochable during any this period . 
before of give a preventative , . afterthought the police of all the communities where has lived the claimants to the over of the five last years . 
he any of know that the broader majority of the réhabilités continue of respect the bill . 
since 28 years , close of a quarter of million of réhabilitations have been awarded and , of this number , only a little more of 6 $ have been révoquées to because of a new offence . 
that represents a rate of success of more of 97p. per . 
the bill of bill C - 7 the primarily on the offenders sexual , who are a small under - group of the more great group of the candidates to the preventative . 
the Department of the Solicitor General has recently esteemed that to the over of the 28 last years , 4 200 offenders sexual had from a preventative . 
only 114 of these offenders , be percent per , have seen their preventative révoquée for have made a other sexual sexual . 
these estimates indicate that , fortunately , only a small number of offenders sexual réhabilités this the risk of récidiver . 
however , also small this number be - he , he is important of reduce this risk to the level the more there possible . 
the bill of bill C - 7 we will to the do . 
the bill of bill C - 7 the support on of the measures who have already been taken for protect the children and other people vulnerable . 
and , a not important has been fact in 1994 , when . has created the Classification national of filtrage . 
this system based on the Centre of information of the police Canadian , the CIPC or , in English , CPIC . 
through to the CIPC , the organizations have access to of the information who their allow of eliminate the perpetrators sexual of children of their understaffed of candidates to of the positions who the best to work with of children . 
the creation of this system has fact the to of extensive consultation with of agencies of services to the children , of authorities school and of responsible of services social , of agencies volunteers such that the Clubs of boys and daughters of the Canada , the Lakes Frères and the Grandes S9urs , Bénévoles Canada , and that the police and of the agencies of assistance to the victims . 
these agencies have said that the audit of the stopped judicial was a part important of a process of filtrage more thorough . 
the Classification national of filtrage is the result of the cooperation between the agencies of services to the children , the as policiers , the Centre of information of the police Canadian , and that the departments of the Solicitor General , of the Health and of the Justice . 
the Classification national of filtrage has given of good results . 
the bill of bill C - 7 will the Classification national of filtrage in corrigeant a scenario who has been décelée . 
in effect , the matter of a offender body réhabilité can wrestled to the attention to the over of a audit of use with of the Centre of information of the police Canadian , or CIPC , to of the for of filtrage . 
in the of present of the things , the Solicitor General has the power of reopen the matter of a offender réhabilité and of the to to of the for consistent with the Administration of the justice , including for the filtrage . 
as the issues of this kind are semiconductors of the system of the CIPC and retained to share in a basic of data scellée , they not apparaissent not to the time of a research of use . 
this system of protection , this is exactly this that is the Act on the stopped judicial . 
in the most of the case , indeed , these issues should be invisible when he there has preventative . 
however , when a human there his Security to a position of confidence and that the matter the to believe that he there would a level increased of risk for a category specific of people vulnerable , a exception is valid . 
the ministers of the Justice and the raisers worry federal , provincial and territorial the are all heard on this point during of their meeting in October 1998 . 
a group of work of senior officials has examined the ways of better protect the children and has submitted ten recommendations in this sense to the ministers responsible . 
these ten recommendations have all been adopted and are in are of be implemented in application . 
he has been proposed , between other , that the issues of the offenders sexual to fact the subject of a preventative be people need for the filtrage of the candidates to of the positions of confidence . 
the Solicitor General of the Canada , with the support of the Minister of the Justice , has undertaken during of the meeting of 1998 of determine the better way of the do in consultation with all his Provincial provincial . 
the bill of bill C - 7 was the next step logical . 
as I the I fact out more earlier , he for that , when the . Cornillon of the CIPC the matter of a offender body the to his preventative , . decide to the place a indicateur . 
some say that this legislation will to the any of the objective basic of the Act on the stopped judicial and this is a concern serious , well heard . 
we want that the system of preventative works well . 
however , he the is of a exception circonscrite and limited who , according me , the only . 
the ministers of the Justice of all the governments have seconded this principle . 
if we not take not this legislation , we might of order the consequences possible of the preventative who would a weighs body to the frayer a move to a position of confidence with of children or of other people vulnerable . 
he will , by the bill and by the policy of the CIPC of the serve of this Code without Authorized . 
he will always obtain the consent of the claimants , and this last will always the choice of withdraw his ask the he not wish not book the matter to the body who welcomes to the filtrage . 
for the ensure that the claimants is identified with estate , . inform his fingerprints photographed to the ask of adjourned of the scellés on the matter described by the preventative . 
finally , the Solicitor General will there that the disclosure of the stopped is valid . 
. précisera the offences them who will be conducted and that the factors who will taken in consideration by the Solicitor General for decide of the desirability of desceller the matter . 
honourable senators , you you remember can - be that the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional has the a very good debate on this who was then the bill of bill C - 69 during and after the appearance of the Solicitor General in June last and to the opportunity of a sitting very culmination in September . 
I like out the contribution very constructive of the senator Nolin . 
the committee was particularly interested by the regarding of children and of other people vulnerable and by the identification specific of the list of the offences them which he is question in this bill of bill . 
I am sure that the excellent work of the committee will useful to the Senate when the committee chair to new this bill of bill , who is now the bill of bill C - 7 . 
he is important of recognize that the bill of bill C - 7 just the add to of the measures already taken by the government for improve the protection of the children . 
these provisions purpose to the recommendation unanimous of the ministers of the provinces and of the territories . 
they have received the support unanimous of all the parties to the other place . 
they are consistent , I believe , with the concern common that have all the members , the of do all this who is possible for protect our children and the adults vulnerable of the prédateurs sexual who turn to their resulting of the wrong .

- honourable senators , I addressed today today the link historic and constitutional between the Canada and the Kingdom - Kingdom , the systems constitutional and Parliamentary and that the citizenship that we share . 
he not there has not if long , of my living , he not there had not of distinction between the citizenship British and the citizenship Canadian , well that the sovereignty of the Canada that découlé of a status particular of dominion . 
in as that human has who has seen the day and who has been way until to the age of 13 years to the Barbade , in the Antilles British and who has déménagé to the Canada , I I lived this double experience . 
of the years more later , after have including that , as English of origin British living to the Quebec , I not would never a true Québécoise , I I left the Quebec for the Ontario , this who fact of me a réfugiée of home the " may laine " . 
I believe firmly that the . sape my heritage and that I must the do point and the defend . 
honourable senators , good number of people to the country , there including of the ministers , préconisent the dismantling of the monarchy constitutional of the Canada . 
I what this phone constitutional of démolition of the Canada . 
they insofar a called outlawing democratic and popular to the any of the aristocratie , but their call in favour of the principle of the democracy is superficiel , rhetoric and very transparent . 
they this the absolutisme to the public as the he the was of the former absolutisme of the man , all in by deliberately disregard of the absolutisme present of the Cabinets and of the courts of the era modern . 
these démolisseurs are in situation of bankrupt independent and moral . 
they induisent the public in mistake because that the Canada not has never had of aristocratie or of structure policy aristocratique . 
, the difference of this who the is past to the Kingdom - Kingdom , the aristocratie not has never fact part of the structure social , economic , military or policy of the Canada . 
the Canada , as new peuplement , not has never known of conditions Social who have in the creation of structures aristocratiques . 
the Canada not has never met the conditions pre to the to of the principle aristocratique , be the principle héréditaire known in England under the beside of bill of the primogéniture , or possédé the structure aristocratique necessary for ensure the protection of the people and of the property , be the protection of the life and of the freedom assured by the aristocrate to his vassaux in existing of their loyalty and of their services . 
, the Kingdom - Kingdom , this structure aristocratique and policy has yielding the not to the over of the time to a government with responsibility government , model that the Canada has adopted as the beginning of the history by the through of the system of the parties political . 
my culture policy the based of a monarchy constitutional and of the institutions parliamentarians British who have given to the Antilles British the more one legislatures legislation of the who of the way way . 
these institutions parliamentarians have led to the abolition of the trade of the esclaves in 1807 and to the abolition of the slavery proprement said in 1833 . 
the part essential of a government first responsible of the Parliament of the Queen is the duty of the cabinet of Majesty Majesty of find , with the confidence of the Parliament , of the solutions political rather that legal , court or military to of the problems and to of the conflict human . 
the policy is the solution to the most of the problems . 
the his of the policy is the more great contribution of our system British . 
the policy , this is also recommend and give of the appointments and of the astre political . 
honourable senators , the Barbade is a old part which the legislative legislative , who has been established in 1639 , is the more former to the outside of the Kingdom Kingdom 
she much criticized with the French Haiti and Cuba the Isabella , who are all two of the republics and all two of the colonies not British . 
I am very there to the Parliament of the Queen and not want of no institution républicaine for the Canada . 
I not like not that the . move of do of the Canada a république . 
I me there opposerai always , as I I an of the do . 
the Canadians not are not least free or least independent that the citizens of not any what république . 
this is a real tragedy that of the schools , of the institutions political and , particularly , of many politicians say of preserve the magnificent heritage constitutional of the Canada . 
some have said that this was sad for a country . 
honourable senators , I in just now to the prerogative of the Queen relatively to the service who is to spirituality of the reconnaissances , of the honours , of the distinctions and of the 1993 . 
this is the former prerogative of the souverains that of spirituality of the honours to their issues . 
inversement , the citizens - the Canadians , in the here - have the right of receive of the honours of the share of their Sovereign . 
in addition , the Canadians who resident in of other country have the right of be privileged by the sovereign of these country . 
in case of duplicates sovereignty and citizenship , these Canadians have right to these benefits . 
that is vital in this era of globalization , that the policy foreign of our government has seconded drew . 
the desire of the human of be privileged by of other human for of the accomplishments community , such that he is expressed by a recognition of the sovereign , is powerful , highest and important . 
all those who the are distinguished on the scene policy , in the industry , in the Arts , in the community , in the service military , by of the actions of bravery and in all the aspects of the service public shared this desire universal of the human of not do that a with his brothers and kindred human . 
such is the prerogative Royal , who well to protect this aspect of the nature human and to the reward . 
our Sovereign indications a relationship special with each of his issues . 
all about , in under of this relationship special , has right to the justice , to the indulgence , to the recognition , to the protection and to the peace of the Queen . 
this is this that which the lexique . 
this right result of this relationship special between the Queen and each of his issues . 
this relationship is mystical and profoundly personal because that she is ancrée in a belief and a ideal who the Order God , the Queen and the nation . 
honourable senators , excusez - me if I not I not fact of distinction between " may ambition human " , " avidité " and need human of approval by his Sovereign , the Source of the distinctions for the contributions to the well common . 
I wanted say désirs honourable for of the honours . 
honourable senators , I speak now of the resolution Nickle , who has been proposed by William Folger Nickle , member Conservative of Kingston , and agreed to the House of the Commons the 22 May 1919 . 
this motion , a motion of the House of the Commons only the ability to Majesty Majesty George V , not has never been Before to the agrément of the Senate . 
the reasons political are clear and evident . 
she would been without no doubt battue to platform couture because that the senators would quickly before his means policy and constitutional . 
in addition , she the rallies to Majesty Majesty , and not to the Governor General of the Canada , who was then the Edinburgh of Devonshire . 
she asked to Majesty Majesty of not not honour of the Canadians and the Athens , in substance , as following : 
we ... ... ... scenes with Honour Majesty , advisable that he him please : 
has ) of the alone now of legislation of the 1993 of honour or of distinction to someone a of your issues domiciliés or resident of plain to the Canada ... ... ... 
b ) that she take the measures necessary , legislation or other , for ensure the bill of the 1993 , dignités , distinctions - the of hand of the blind by example - to the Late of a human currently domiciliée to the Canada or to his residence usual then that she from of a as Doctorate héréditaire ... ... ... 
honourable senators , ten years more later , in 1929 , the Commons have the a other debate on the resolution Nickle . 
the 12 February 1929 , Charles Cahan , member Conservative , has proposed that be set a committee Special of the House for do inquiry and report on the desirability of limit , amend or rescinder the question Nickle agreed the 22 May 1919 . 
the Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had said in this debate , as the reformed the é of the House of the Commons of this day - that to the page 78 : 
if we vote of not not have of 1993 Doctorates , of plight of distinction or of astre to the Canada , we issue to the principle and not in we not of the all ; abolissons - the completely ; but if the souverains or the leaders of other States are given to spirituality of the honours to of the Canadians , I believe , as to me , that we must to our own sovereign of him give this prerogative before all the other . 
the results of the vote taken the 14 February on the motion Mr. Cahan indicate that the Prime Minister King and the Leader of the Opposition conservatrice , Mr. Richard B . Bennett , had all two voted Right . 
... the government of Majesty Majesty of the Canada is of notice that the motion regarding the 1993 Doctorates agreed the 22 May 1919 , by a vote of the majority of the House of the Commons of the thirteenth Parliament ( who was dissousle 4 October 1921 ) not makes no Majesty Majesty or the government of Majesty Majesty to the Canada , or the ten - seventeenth Parliament of the Canada . 
in of other words , the text ask to the sovereign , by the way of a resolution of the House of the Commons , of stop of exercise his prerogative to the Canada . 
no group of words not could have least of effect , in right . 
not only he not had no effect , but , I regret of have to the see , he issues a injure to the sovereign same . 
, the about of his efforts in view of back in into the recommendations to Majesty Majesty regarding the list of the astre , the Prime Minister , in the same speech , has added : , to the page 96 of the Hansard of the Commons : 
this is that the act of the Prime Minister ; he must in assume the responsibility ; he must also take on him the responsibility of have informed the Crown that the resolution agreed by the House of the Commons is invalide and of none effect in this who taking the prerogative of the sovereign . 
is who is expectation clear to my " . 
honourable senators , to my notice , all distinguished Canadian who is pressenti for be appointed to the House of the Lords of the Kingdom - Kingdom or all Canadian pressenti by Majesty Majesty the Queen for a recognition whatever fact honour to the Canada . 
each time that a Canadian is honoured , this is a great honour for me . 
this is a great honour for we all . 
the Canada in resort up . 
I in just now Mr. Conrad Black . 
honourable senators , recently , . has used the words " Lord Almost " and " Lord Nearly Nearly " for décrireM. Conrad Black . 
I know do the distinction between this who is good and this who is ridiculous . 
I know do the distinction between a criticism an and a criticism demeaning . 
because Mr. Black is a man rich , some find good of the cover of for as the he was insensitive . 
I believe Mr. Conrad Black is a great and distinguished Canadian . 
the world Mr. Black not is not the hall . 
this not is not a world in which I I worked . 
the world is the of the high funding where the . the of great risk financial - the world of the entrepreneuriat , of the competition , of the trade and of the production of newspapers . 
this is a world that I respect , same if I not there am not directly mêlée . 
I am a Liberal - a Liberal to the sense classic of the 19 century . 
the libéralisme me has learned to respect the people who have the makes necessary for create the foreign and of the jobs for of other people . 
the libéralisme me has learned that the employment of people by the business privacy by Opposition to the sector public is the true legislation of the foreign economic of a community . 
honourable senators , of such have thought that the more great contribution to the world that had specifically the libéralisme , in as that principle policy , was the concept that the foreign could be created and shared by all and each - that the creation of the foreign and the fact of the he not were not subject to the principle of the hérédité , but rather to the ability , the spirit of initiative , the energy and the effort of each be human . 
the parcours Mr. Black , who is unborn in a community modest , represents a daring for the libéralisme and the principle Liberal . 
of same , the libéralisme , by Opposition to the let - do , assumed that the governments speaks on the markets not only for protect the life , the integrity and the competition , but also for give a depend of security social to the workers . 
Mr. . Black has created of the employment for of the thousands of Canadians , this which little of people can the boasting . 
I respect that . 
he has also for that he there that of the competition on the market of the newspapers to the Canada . 
I am of notice that this is a honour for the Canada if the Prime Minister Tony Blair , of the Kingdom - Kingdom , has recommended the appointment Mr. Black to the House of the Lords , to as of hand and of Lord not héréditaire . 
he is regrettable that the Prime Minister Blair that withdrawn his recommendation and I hope that he songera soon to circumstance the recommendation Mr. Black . 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
senator Cools , I must you attention that the period of time who you is granted for do your statement is has . 
however , you be continue if you in are the Authorized and that the - this you is granted . 
the senator Cools : 
thank , Honour the . 
I like have the Authorized of continue . 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
the Authorized is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Cools : 
thank , honourable senators . 
the by of the press Lord Thompson Mr. Black are all the two honour to the Canada , all as the former Prime Minister John Turner . 
they witnessing all of the trade who , during of the centuries , have for to of the Canadians and to of the Britanniques , which me - same , white and black , of sit in the two Houses of the Parliament , to the Canada and Kingdom Kingdom 
honourable senators , the attitudes and the misgivings human are mystérieuses , all as the fragilité human . 
that fact part of the condition human . 
the spirit human is a roublard and the motivator the any . 
this scenario of the condition human me has been disinfection of way poignante in a clause on the confidence and the méchanceté Mr. Nickle , who has been prepared by a member of his family , James Travers . 
in a clause The in the edition of the 14 September 99 of the Toronto Star and who spoke of the battle Mr. Black for the allocations of the as of hand , Mr. Travers wrote : 
in a access of despite and in the absence of the Prime Minister of the time , Robert Border , Nickle has presented to any steamship his resolution to the House of the Commons after have failed to do legislation the as of as to Daniel Denise , the of of the University Queen s and the a - father ... 
for the venger , Nickle has wanted the ensure that of other not could not obtain this that . had refused to his family . 
his resolution Requesting that the king the abstienne of spirituality of the 1993 to of the residents Canadian has been agreed by any the House emportée by the opinion public that he not partageait not . 
the tricherie of Nickle is the because of a sure embarrassment in the family , since W . F . Nickle was the a - father of the s9ur of my great - mother . 
the hon. Joan Fraser : 
honourable senators , I I a question to question and , if the senator Cools me the allows , a rectification to to . 
I not think not that anyone can deny the accomplishments Mr. Black in the area of the edition . 
however , if you étudiez the statements financial of the businesses that he control , you find that the number of jobs has decreased and not increased in the newspapers that he control , since that he in has fact the acquisition . 
my question respect the nature of the distinctions that , of after the senator , he would appropriate that of the Canadians to of the share of governments foreign . 
he there has a difference between the distinctions think Doctorates , as the as of as or the Legion of honour , and those who are of the who the receives a législateur of a country abroad . 
the House of the Lords is a legislative legislative . 
she not has can - be not as of power that our Senate , but we are personally well whom for know that this not is not a something futile that of be législateur . 
the hon. senator see - she a difference between the two types of distinction and believe she that he there has place of the consider differently , the given that a cinquantaine of years have past since that a human active in the sector Canadian of the media has agreed the dignity of hand ? 
I attention by example Mr. Kenneth Thompson has felt rodents of repeating the as of the father to the Late of Lord Thompson . 
the senator Cools : 
I thank the hon. senator of his question . 
in this who respect the honours and the governments foreign , I wish to make that I not consider not the Queen of England as a government abroad . 
I not cannot too insist that - that . 
she is the Queen of the Canada , my Queen . 
when I I fact my into to the Senate in 1984 , after have been escortée the long of this for , I I the the with on the Bible and I I came oath , and this is to this Queen that I I came the oath of allegiance . 
the Queen of the Canada not is not a government abroad . 
I I can - be difficulty before the comments of the hon. senator . 
if this is the case , I him cannot grateful of to of other Particulars . 
of the honours are Duty all the time . 
he there has of the Canadians who members in of the legislatures legislation across in the world . 
the hon. senator the recall surely of a meeting of the IPU , to which we we attended all the two he there has few months , and where I I met of the citizens Canadian who members to of the legislatures legislation of some country baltes , I believe . 
the House of the Lords is a Parliament , not a legislative legislative , and he there has a enormous difference between a legislative legislative and a Parliament . 
the House of the Lords is a old institution . 
she is a of the more ancient of the world . 
this is can - be because that many of my friends families have sat to the House of the Lords , but I appartiens to the group of the Canadians who are many of respect for this House . 
. me has unequal , when I was small daughter , to the Barbade , that when all the rest had failed , he former always the possible of in call to the House of the Lords . 
I not at not to the movement who would that the . the people to brief deadline the Houses high , there including the House of the Lords . 
finally , for this who is of the honours , I say that they are countless . 
he there has of the honours who clauses of the 1993 and of other not . 
he there has of the honours who which of the precedents , of other not . 
he there has of the honours who clauses a among , of other not . 
he there has any a range of honours . 
I urge the senator to the insist to me for forward a proposal to on the study of the 1993 Doctorates and the Eligibility of the Canadians to these 1993 . 
in this era modern where the . authority of the 1993 héréditaires , I not think not that Majesty Majesty authority too of 1993 héréditaires to the Canada . 
I not I not succeeded to in find of new . 
I I enumerated a number countless of 1993 of chevaliers in my remarks . 
the examples who me are immediately came to the spirit are clearly Lord Thompson him - same and , well heard , the former - Prime Minister of the Canada , Mr. R . B . Bennett , who , as we the know , has been appointed vicomte in 1941 . 
clearly , . embrouille the things . 
the fact is Mr. Black has been recommended for the peerage to life and he the is , according me , of a highest aspiration .

the Act of 1968 amend the right pénal

the hon. Lucie pin : 
honourable senators , that the Canadians and the Canadians in be aware or not , the Adopted , the 14 May 1969 , of the Act of 1968 amend the right pénal , who légiférait on the contraception and the abortion procedure , has irrévocablement changed our lives . 
the complications during the accouchements not were not few , and only the case the more serious the terminaient by a trajet on the been back of the voiture of the doctor until to the Hospital the more it and often , he was too later for save the bébé or for be a césarienne . 
who was - he save , the bébé or the mother ? 
the state also was very clear : the contraception was illégale , of same that the abortion . 
opposite to the state and to the Church , the women not had no choice . 
for many of between we who worked in gynéco - obstétrique , the quo quo was became unbearable and we we decided of work in favour of the change for give to the women the accessibility to the contraception . 
the bill of bill C - 150 , more known under the behalf of " bill of bill omnibus " , has been adopted in 1969 . 
he has work well of the things for a myriad of people . 
for repeating the expression of the former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau , he has this the process government to bouter the state outside of the Houses to stay of the people . 
the Prime sexual , the choice of practices of reproductive and the ébats amoureux were and footnotes to the area private , to condition that that the the between adults consentants . 
for the women , the prospects open were afraid more major . 
he was now possible of do of the choice . 
the women acquéraient finally a minimum of control on their own life , which not the fix more to a series attainable of grossesses , of risk for the health and of children too many for their capabilities financial . 
this new freedom has served of springboard for the many other freedoms and options who have amended the role of the women in our society : the believe of itself , the education , the employment , a Senators to the chapter and the accountability . 
honourable senators , I am very proud of have could participate to this process and of have could see the real changes who the are opérés through to our efforts - efforts who vigorously to the time if empathize and if necessary . 
he the is that of a of the businesses the more important of my life . 
more important still , this anniversary proves a time of more that the change is possible , that the people can amend of the things in the life of them and that the determination and the passion can do of the wonders . 
celebrate therefore and which tribute to all the citizens who have worked to the éclosion of the freedoms fully of the bill of bill C - 150 . 
the Reverend father Emile Shoufani 
the hon. Pierre Ban Ban : 
honourable senators , I I the honour of you do share of the visit recent to the Canada , 10 to the 25 October , of the Reverend father Emile Shoufani , steering of the Seminar St. - Joseph and of the school school of Nazareth , and curé of Nazareth , in Israel . 
the father Shoufani , familièrement called Abouna Emile by all , be " father Emile " in Arab , is a man and a priest profoundly committed in the Church , the Church melkite vowels Catholic , in his community Arab and in the country , Israel . 
the father Shoufani was to the Canada the guest of the Centre of action volunteer Émilie Gamelin of Joliette , who had organized a forum international on " the unwelcome of the life and the population " , convention who has attention a Dreadnought many and who has been a great success to all ways . 
I like also thank the members of the clergé , who not have physically no effort for that this visit be couronnéede success . 
during his visit to the Canada , the father Shoufani has had of the talks approfondis with a if great number of personalities that he me is impossible of the appoint all . 
I me limiterai to mention the meetings with the personalities following : the Prime Minister of the Canada , the very hon. Jean tien , the Speaker of the Senate , the hon. Gildas L . Molgat , the Minister of the Affairs foreign , the hon. Lloyd Axworthy , the senior officials of the Council private , be the Department of the Prime Minister , and that the diplomats of the Department of the Affairs foreign responsible of the East - East . 
the father Shoufani has also given several conferences on the situation to the East - East , including before the Middle East Discussion Group , here same to the Parliament , and that before the Council of the relations international of Montreal . 
he has also issue of the issues proprement church , including on " the future common of the Christian , of the musulmans and of the Jews " , to the University St. - Paul of Ottawa and before the community of Madonna House to Combermere , in Ontario , where he has met the former Archbishop of Galilée , Mgr Joseph Raya , a man because that I admire greatly . 
the father Shoufani has also met the Archbishop of St. - Boniface , Mgr Antoine Hacault , and that the évêque of Joliette , Mgr Gilles Lussier . 
the a of the times the more émouvants has without no doubt been the meeting of the father Shoufani with the very P Elliott Trudeau , the former Prime Minister of the Canada , who has dominé the scene policy of our country during as of years . 
this meeting has had place to the time oùM. Trudeau performs ses80 years . 
the father Shoufani not has up of work to réconcilier and to insist all the citizens of the country , Israel .

he has also met several personalities crowned of the community Jewish Canadian , and that the Congress Jewish , branch of the Quebec , and he has the visit to the school séfarade of language French of Montreal , the school Maimonide . 
this that I find the more admirable home the father Shoufani , this is that the deep respect for the life not can be dissocié of his conviction according which we must we strive of improve the fate of all the people human and that human not has the right of we of the suffering to the other . 
the approach positive of the father Shoufani in the of regulation of the problems is remarkable . 
the - this is always prepared to do the Prime not . 
he the reducing always of understand the dreams and the ideas of the other and of appreciation of the empathy to their regard . 
the the the Speaker : 
senator Ban Ban , your three minutes are period . 
are - you the Authorized of continue ? 
the senator Ban Ban : 
yes . 
the the the Speaker : 
the Authorized is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Ban Ban : 
honourable senators , Emile Shoufani is unborn to Nazareth in 1947 . 
in as that redemption of origin Arab in the state of Israel , Emile Shoufani has past 52 years to show , in his life and the work , that he is possible of to a term to of the centuries of Opposition and of violence . 
his life is a testament to the coexisting peaceful of the Jews , of the Arabes , of the musulmans and of the Christian in a region who has desperately need of a model of peace and of reconciliation . 
Emile Shoufani has learned by the through of tragedies personal the sense real of the shirts and of the respect for the other . 
he is a model for all . 
the great - father and the uncle have been killed during the War of 1948 , during of the déportation of villageois to Eilabun . 
his great - mother , who has lost the husband and a son , has unequal the shirts to the small - son . 
he has up to the within of the minority Arab who is computer in the new state of Israel . 
the difficulties which he has should do opposite to the over of this period of his life have unequal to Emile that the humility is a under , but not the poverty . 
rebel during the tumultuous to the Seminar St. - Joseph , Emile prit profoundly conscience of the value of the life all in ressentant the need of do a difference . 
he décida of become priest . 
then that he vivait to Paris , of 1964 to 1971 , to the the of his studies in philosophical and sinful , Emile Shoufani has read Treblinka , by Jean - François Steiner . 
that the has led to in learn more on the Holocaust , to visit Dachau and he is income home him after have or a changing spiritual , in to a point of view all to fact different . 
ordered priest of the Church Catholic vowels in 1971 , he has said : in the Prime sermon : 
very earlier to the over of the Department , in as that pasteur of various villages of Galilée , Abouna Emile is became known as a médiateur , not only for the regulation of the differences between the communities religious Christian , mulsumane and druze , but in as that very advocate of a real coexisting government not simply to live Coast to Coast , but to really share a life common . 
when the évêque him has done the direction of the Seminar and school school St. - Joseph , in 1976 , Abouna Emile the was already win the confidence of all the people of the region . 
the fact that of many parents of many communities religious him confient their child shows the magnitude of the confidence and of the respect that he the is win in these will . 
in 1976 , the Seminar St. - Joseph had 200 students and was on the point of close . 
the father Emile has decided of and the challenge , of try of maintain the school met with a will stipulates by his faith . 
he has tried of wasn two objectives . 
he the was all of first of replicating of St. - Joseph a school of first class tour to the excellence . 
he has then sensibilisé a new generation of students to their stories and identités separate , all in obtenant of their share a commitment total to the regard of their integration to the state of Israel . 
his first battle has consisté to draw a staff qualified and dynamic partageant his vision according which the school must not only éduquer , but also expand any the human , " the one in as that human way to the Prime plan " . 
the second achievement révolutionnaire has consisté to into the school in a to Joint open to all the religions , to the two sexes and to different crops . 
according him : 
St. - Joseph not is not a school Christian who accept the musulmans and the druzes , but a school where the Christian , the musulmans and the druzes live together . 
of together with the body professoral , Emile Shoufani anyone constantly to achieve of the standards of education high . 
is this that said the father Shoufani : 
we must form the 20 $ to 30 $ academic Arab which the country has need . 
ten years more later , the school is in legislation of support the competition of the best schools in Israel . 
today today , the school the 1 200 students and , each year , of 120 à130 students of the two sexes receive their had . 
Emile Shoufani country always the same vigour révolutionnaire that he there has 24 years . 
he continues of the preoccupied of the appointments to the work and to the board of Administration of the school . 
in 1989 , after have established the points strong and the reputation of the school on the plan school , the father Emile has decided of the spend to the second objective , be a bill - pilot of dialogue with the " Lyada " , a school Jewish of Prime plan relevant of the university Hebrew of Jerusalem , to of " give to our young the tools which they have need for ensure their full integration in the state of Israel all in conservant their identity . " 
today today , the mission of the Seminar St. - Joseph is to ensure the " education to the service of the peace " . 
the father Shoufani has said often : 
I believe as to this country to the history long and variée , in quality of Arabe , of redemption and of Israélien . 
these differences not me pose not of problems . 
through to my faith , I I a vision Universal me allowing of transcender the line ability and of better listen my brothers . 
in ending , I add that the father Shoufani was informed during his visit in our country by Ms Soad Haddad , that I I the privilege of know since more of ten years . Ms 
Soad Haddad is remarkable in the legislation where , as that she can the remember , she has always have that she draft more to the great community human that to a family particular . 
the existence has always been for she linked to the sentiment of be in mission . 
this is this who the has took to the unable completely to of the spend to his tasks current . 
she working Coast to Coast with the father Emile since more of 20 years to the service of the Church melkite and of the community Arab of the state of Israel . 
: said , honourable senators , we we essentially two options . 
the a is of insist on the differences between the people human , this who is easy . 
we can see to what conflict tragic that has led . 
the other , to the contrary , is of to the focus on this who closest the people of different groups socioéconomiques , of religions separate and to the background different . 
this is many more difficult . 
however , this is without no doubt the option the more generous , the better participate to the time modern and the for which all the people well define should the fight . 
this is the seaway that the parents of the father Shoufani him have enseignée , the who the has guided all to the long of his life . 
he is rare of meet a man as the father Shoufani , fresher of a such vision and of a such courage . 
this was a great honour for me , who am unborn in of country , of the with and that the tireless , the very requested Ms Soad Haddad , during their visit to the Canada .

the media across to the Canada have reported a unfortunate incident which had been victim a agente of the SCRS who had left a document to uniqueness secret on the been back of his voiture then that she oblige to a part of hockey to Toronto . 
the Minister could - he we say what was the rating of security there to this document ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the hon. senator of this question . 
he has course been brought to the knowledge of the public by the media , and by the the confirmed by the Minister to the House of the Commons , that a manquement enough serious to the protocol of security had been made by a used of the SCRS . 
the direction of the SCRS examine now this case . 
as to the rating of security there to the document in question , I more determine if I then obtain this information for the hon. senator . 
the senator Kinsella : 
I thank the hon. senator of the Engage to the do . 
he the is of know if this document was very secret , secret or " . 
the Parliament has institué the committee of monitoring of the activities of the Intelligence of security . 
the Parliament has given to this committee Civil the mandate legal of monitor the activities of the SCRS . 
is - he true that this is only by the seaway of the newspapers that the chairman of the CSARS has heard speak of this manquement , then that the Solicitor General in had had knowledge since a sure time - before same that the newspapers not in do of ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
the honourable senators understand that I not cannot not normally how the inspecteur General of the SCRS has been the to the aware of this case , or how the CSARS the has been . 
however , the Minister has said to the other place that he in had been informed he there has two or three weeks . 
I think that he is enough clear that the CSARS in has been informed someone time more later . 
in fact , I then say to the honourable senators that the SCRS and the inspecteur General of the SCRS are inquiry in this case to the time where I you about . 
of more , the CSARS has him also undertaken a review to this regard of his own initiative . 
as the honourable senators , I am anxious of obtain a report to this about , and I be happy of in do know the details . 
the hon. Jean - Claude Rivest : 
the Minister could - he we say the he there a rule of the services Unauthorized as to the handling of the documents ? 
is - this that a human or a officer can all simply the expressed with of the documents ? 
there he a procedure who not would presumably not been followed in this case ? 
the Minister we said that the government federal essayera of do inquiry for see exactly this who the is past . 
the Minister can - he be more enable as to the nature of the inquiry to come opposite to this malencontreux incident ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , he is obvious that he there has had offence to the security . 
the human in question will Before to a inquiry seeing to the time by the SCRS and by the CSARS . 
as must the know the hon. senator , the CSARS is the committee independent of monitoring locus who has undertaken this task . 
I am sure that these two agencies the discussed of their responsibilities with any the expeditiously and the speed The and that they poisoned a report more detailed of the events who the are products . 
the senator Rivest : 
honourable senators , course , he there has of the inconvénients on the plan Economy . 
the Canada and the Service Canadian of the Intelligence of security Lillian with of very many country to across the world . 
the Minister and the government are - they aware that this incident risk of entacher very seriously the credibility of the services Unauthorized Canadian ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , fortunately , this incident seems be isolated . 
well that he be regrettable and that . not can deny the serious of these events , I hope that they not will not of impact sensibles on our relations with the other country , particularly our allies . 
the senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , the Minister could - he we say why he has was two weeks sacrifice to the Solicitor General for prevent the committee who , according the Minister , will now do inquiry on this case ? 
why expect two weeks ? 
not there has he not a sentiment of responsibility in the spirit of the government when they are the to the aware of a case as the - this ? 
the Parliament has created a committee responsible of investigate on this kind of situation and yet the Department of the Solicitor General has left traîner the things during two weeks sacrifice . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I can nothing say of precise on the question of the will because I not know not exactly when the information has been remaining . 
however , I believe understand that the inspecteur General of the SCRS has immediately taken the case in with and the in ' as he the must . 
the role of the is of investigate on of the activities as those that exhibition the inspecteur General in the framework of this case . 
I not know not exactly to what time the CSARS interviendrait . 
the hon. Roch Bolduc : 
honourable senators , he there has few years , we we had of the problems the to a identifies of the budget of the Minister of the Finance . 
finally , all the world was to the aware and the Minister has should deal a speech quick . 
there has he a procedure government who assure the confidentiality of the documents ? 
the he there a procedure , has she several degrees of quality ? 
by example , we know all that the budget of the Minister of the Finance and the questions of security national are very Unauthorized . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I am sure that he there various classifications of security for the documents of the SCRS . 
I not know not in detail all the levels of security , but I will of my better for obtain this Intelligence for the senator . 
the senator Bolduc : 
honourable senators , I will to to the for because that recently , we we are left say , to the about of the transactions with the Americans in the of Defence , that we were more or least fiables . 
the Americans not would more transiger with we and we give some for for of the Mothballed for the Defence because that we have the reputation of not be not enough fiables . 
this is or of the do say that by our neighbours , particularly when we involvement with them of good relations in General . 
the Minister could - he to to the attention of the Minister of the Defence national this question of the more high importance ? 
we must do someone something to this about because you can imagine that a such case not assistance not the relations between our two country . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I am all to fact prepared to i the concerns of the senators as to the nature of this incident . 
I Dolly the importance that overwhelmingly the senators to this unwitting series of events . 
however , I not am not sure of share the notice expressed by the hon. senator in the preamble of his question . 
the question of the ITAR fact part of a category different . 
he is certainly disturbing of see that a information or a document sufficient not is not manipulé with all the precautions necessary as this was the case for this document . 
a inquiry is in over , seeing to the time by the SCRS to the Economy and by the CSARS . 
I am sure that the measures corrective who the do will taken and that the human in because will handled of way appropriate . 
the justice 
the possible of protect more the people against the violence 
the hon. Herbert O . Sparrow : 
honourable senators , I I a question to question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
the Canadians of all the country are concerned by the violence who has over between the young . 
a other concern is implementation in obviously by a clause who has been released recently by a newspaper of Vancouver on the fact that a other case of saucissonnage in British - British had cost the life to a lady citizen . 
he seems that these people not can nothing do for the protect against these crimes . 
I not wish not to raise the question of the control of the weapons to fire , but he was a time where the community agricultural the protégeait to the way of fusils of whaling . 
. not the attaquait not to the farmers of afraid of be one . 
the Code criminal , of the serve of brouillard of poivre for the protect . 
the people of the communities rural and , now , the people of the regions urban not have not of other ways of the protect and they are absolutely terrifiés by all these stories of saucissonnage , of effraction , of rape and of murder which they while speak . 
if the Minister not knows not the matter for the moment , can - be could - he in discuss with his colleagues , including the Minister of the Justice . 
of the measures are - they in preparation , who could help the people which . which the scenario to the protect they - same ? 
well of the people not have not the ways of entourer their ownership of clôtures or of have of the guard of security . 
these people are left to they - same and they are the victims of the criminals of our society . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the problems described by the senator Sparrow we confrontation all of indignation . 
the Code criminal allows to the courts of the show very get to the authors of these crimes . 
I understand however the concern expressed by the senator . 
the problem the can - be in part to the evolution of the relations family , to the over of the last decades . 
, a time , a family deals or agricultural could be become a family extended , if well that the people seniors were least often livrées to they - same , far of the other members of the family . 
this is a proposition , but I believe that , if we comparions the situation current to the of he there has 30 years , we constaterions that he there has today today many more of people seniors who live only to the place of do part of a family extended . 
the protection that the senator ask is can - be , for this only reason , more necessary of our days . 
I I taken knowledge of data statistics according which the number of crimes violent would to the - in the together of the people . 
he must always see these data of a i criticism , but he is sure that , for the victims agressées home they , particularly when he the is of people seniors , the problem remains serious . 
I will certainly do share to my colleagues of the cabinet of the concern and of the question of the hon. senator . 
the Agriculture and the agroalimentaire 
the crisis agricultural to the Manitoba and in Saskatchewan - - possible of a program of credit agricultural 
the hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , I like question to the Leader of the government to the Senate a question on the crisis agricultural , who seems the only of day in day . 
the 2 November 99 , I I asked to the Minister if the government was prepared to to of the identify to the credit agricultural to of come in assistance to some farmers who are unable of duties their debts . 
the Leader of the government of the Senate has me well welcome my suggestion , in taxfiler including that these questions were already the subject of discussions , but that he not wanted not violation the confidentiality of the cabinet . 
knows - . , to this at - this , this that the government has the intention of do in this who respect the credit agricultural ? 
is well a area where the government could give the example to the Banking and to the Cooperatives of credit . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I regret of not power give of response more specific for the time . 
since the last time that we we issue this question , the government federal has " a amount Supplementary of 170 million of $ to the program ACRA to of offer a assistance from to the farmers . 
, this time - that , we not know not to the fair how s respond the governments provincial . 
we not know not the they accept of be their share , correspondent to 40 per of this amount , the government federal stimulates 60 per of the funds , as he the had fact for the program distinct . 
, least that the situation that changed recently , . me has informed that the provinces not had not agreed of be more of money . 
the governments of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba have all two said formally that they refusaient of increase their contribution financial . 
the hon. senator knows can - be if the situation has shifted since . 
I I of the difficulty to understand this reaction . 
the two first ministers provincial are came to Ottawa for describe the serious of the situation and the need of a assistance immediate . 
in fact , to the over of the few five last years , the assistance that the two governments provincial have granted to their farmers has been substantially reduced . 
when they have required with insistance that the government federal ruined , he has paid 170 million of $ in the program . 
this not was can - be not all this that the farmers want , but this was personally a legislation positive . 
however , he seems that the reactions of the governments of the Manitoba and of the Saskatchewan have left to wanting . 
the senator Gustafson : 
honourable senators , the Minister not does not to my question to the about of the credit agricultural , who is a responsibility of the government federal . 
this responsibility not is not shared with the governments provincial . 
he the is of funds advanced by the government federal . 
what that he in be , in this who respect the program ACRA , in the region where I lives , the people who receive of the funds in the framework of this program are financially to the comfortable . 
the farmers who have need of money not in receive not . 
I like that . slow a inquiry for know who receives the money . 
the families poor who have need of the money not the receive not . 
this is this that me have said of the farmers of any the Saskatchewan . 
for to to the Corporation of the credit agricultural , the government there he a relief of the debt ones with of this society ? 
the Corporation of the credit agricultural not is not a responsibility shared with the provinces ; she provincial only of the government federal . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I not trying not of éluder the question of the senator . 
I not can there answer today today . 
of any obviously , this matter is between the hands of the Minister . 
as that I be in legislation of give a response clear , I be very happy of the do . 
honourable senators , the two governments provincial in because have uphill expressed , to Ottawa and , , a his concern for the farmers . 
they not at not of apologize when they forward that the program not works not perfectly well . 
we the know . 
the senators of the two sides the have should during the debate Special the to the ask of the hon. senator Gustafson . 
however , the program not has not been designed by the only government federal , he has been public in cooperation with the two governments who now , after their intervention impressive , say of the Engage guarantee . 
the they not aimaient not the program , they would could propose of the improvements . 
the Minister of the Agriculture trying of improve the effectiveness of the program . 
however , the fact that the - this not be not perfect not apologize no the conduct of these two first ministers . 
the Program of assistance in case of disaster linked to the income agricultural - - effectiveness of the program 
the hon. Herbert O . Sparrow : 
honourable senators , the government of the Saskatchewan has spent 200 million of $ to the program , but this amount not is not spent because the government federal not débourse not his share of the money . 
he there has therefore of the are in Awaiting , but the government federal not has no plan who would of distribute this money . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate has spoke of a amount additionnel of 170 million of $ . 
this amount is heartened to all the Canada and not to the only region affected by the problem which he is question . 
the Department him - same has said that he would some are to the grants already awarded . 
by therefore , he not just not in assistance to the majority of the farmers who not have nothing received and which the requests , in some case , are empilées on the pupitres since six months . 
the governments of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba have paid the are that they were help to the program . 
the Leader has said that the governments had agreed of the do . 
. we said without has that the governments and the organizations agricultural the are heard on this point . 
however , this not is not the case . 
this who had been proposed has been agreed , but the program the in implement was well different and the provinces have said that this not was not the program that they had approved . 
the Federation Canadian of the agriculture and all the farmers have said that this not was not the program agreed to the origin . 
they will the against to this program because the money not is not paid to those who in have need . 
Mr. the Minister , you can certainly say that we in we discussed to the Senate and with the important delegation who is came we meet and that that not works not . 
the committee Senate of the agriculture and the committee Standing of the agriculture of the House of the Commons know that such is the case , but we persistons to say that this not is not of our fault . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate will he to the Minister of the Agriculture of we say finally if the government does do someone something , for that we can we withdraw dignement ? 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , as the senators of the two sides the have said to the over of the debate of emergency , the program not works not well and must be amended . 
. in has agreed generally and the message has been clear sent . 
I not like not let hear that this not was not the case . 
honourable senators , I say that he there had that a opportunity for the provinces of do a contribution important . 
all the senators can well think that 170 million of $ , this not was not enough , but this is a contribution concrete and , to my notice , the two provinces would should in provide as . 
the effectiveness of the programs of assistance - - survival of the young farmers 
the hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
the farmers suffering in dead now . 
those who are more seniors and better fortunate can to to the across of the crisis because that they are through since long . 
those who in tears are the young who want preserve the business é . 
we are in are of the defeat slowly , but surely . 
a year after the other , they suffering in dead and are bankrupt . 
, the place of their say one that he not there will more of assistance , that they will people the they are unable of survive by their own ways , the government the assistance to the the - piecemeal for keep living a false hope . 
this is unreasonable . 
the Minister think he that this is a way equitable of deal the young farmers Canadian ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , we should do our possible for help the young farmers who are in a situation criticism . 
we should can - be speak with of the Minister to the about of the matter of the Corporation of the credit agricultural . 
this is a problem of size who , as the honourable senators the know , is with to the over of the products of basic on the market world and to the fact that our farmers not have not right to of the rules of the stake field . 
this is a problem of size who has of the impact to the the international and which he will seek a solution to various levels . 
my colleagues me limited the insurance that of the efforts are been and that of the discussions are in over not only with the Minister of the Agriculture and the Department , but also on the scene international , and this , to of deal the problem more broader that is , between other things , the absence of rules of the stake field . 
the crisis agricultural to the Manitoba and in Saskatchewan - - Program of assistance in case of disaster linked to the income agricultural - - are paid to the claimants 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
well that the hon. Minister that fact of the efforts meritorious for examine the situation , they not reflect always not the emergency of the situation or the crisis current . 
this is very well of speak of the modest are who have been awarded or of the situation World , but he there has now emergency . 
in response to of the emergency , he must adopt of the solutions more like , by example , in eliminating the ACRA and in conclusion of the measures completely different for come in assistance to those who are in the need . 
he there has to little close a week , of the people of the community agricultural to the Manitoba me have said that about 59p. per of the requests made by the farmers had been provided . 
the Minister knows - he if the situation is in are of the improve , the the of the restructuring of the ACRA who seems have had place ? 
with what speed the things can - they the improve ? 
the time leadership and the situation the détériore without has .

the the the Speaker : 
hon. senator Murray , before that you not commenciez , I remind that our Rules you allocates 45 minutes in as that Prime orator to take the speak after the author of the bill of bill . 
but you you already prepared de37 minutes . 
he you rest therefore eight minutes . 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
I will do of my better . 
honourable senators , he the is of the second half of a speech that I I began to deal the 4 November in sloppily the debate , to the behalf of the Opposition loyal of Majesty Majesty , on the bill of bill C - 6 . 
before of enter in the great of the about , I like correct a inexactitude that I I commise in my speech of the 4 November . I was of the efforts who have been facts in the past by various parties political in view of of in the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedom a right to the life privacy . 
I I should by mistake Mr. tien had been the Minister of the Justice of the government Trudeau before the election of 1979 . 
however , he not in is nothing . 
Mr. . tien is became Minister of the Justice when the government Trudeau has taken the power in 1980 . 
always in my speech of the 4 November , I I open a parenthèse to comments of the uniqueness " of the data of the census . 
the question has been raised more earlier today today during of the statement of senators of our colleague , the senator Milne . 
I I spoke of the campaign in over , who could to the amendment of the bill proposed by shore Wilfrid Laurier , thereby the confidentiality of the information personal and to uniqueness private collected to the opportunity of a census . 
, the time , I me was opposed by principle to this that the bill be amended . 
since , of the Canadians indignés by this decision me have wrote - and same , in some case , these people were as - essentially of the people that the généalogie interest . 
my response , that I prejudice to this day , had been the next : that . we please these circumventing of protection , and we the Working , the he is asked to the Parliament of amend the bill . 
but , on the principle General , I prejudice my decision . 
I believe that should stay confidentiels all information personal and private , collected by the government in the context of a census , on the faith of a bill thereby the confidentiality of the these information . 
I believe , by principle , that we should avoid of amend the bill to the lightly . 
after all , to the over of the years , the questions raised in the framework of the marked are were of more in more indiscrètes , and this not is not because that the people décèdent that the government can the esteemed administration of the obligation of respect the confidentiality promise to these people . 
this is my opinion , honourable senators . 
in of the site such that the Senate , we should we to on our guard opposite to the attempts overcoming of some historians , experts in Science Social and journalists of we persuade that the right of to and of to of the information should the just on all the other rights learning . 
this is why I I préconisé that we envisagions of of a right to the protection of the information personal in the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms . 
I acknowledge fully that we we here a conflict or a use between two principles legitimate , the a the the access to the information and the other the protection of the information personal . 
as for all other conflict of principles , he must attempt of find a fair balance . 
this use of principles or of values more also in the bill of bill which we are before . 
as I me am committed to the do , I I met a sure number of parties interested or agri by this bill of bill or I I had with they of the conferences phone or still I I read carefully their you . 
I not I not changed of notice to the about of this bill of bill . 
I not take not your time today today in trying of be the testimony that they will invited to give before the committee , I in am sure . 
however , I like attention some of the major questions on which the committee will the look . 
honourable senators , he there has a confusion extraordinary same home the government and his counsel as to know if this bill of bill the applies to the sector of the care of health and how . 
the senator Kirby , the sponsor of the bill of bill , could well would speak of this question when he will a term to the debate in second Reading . 
however , he will do better that this that he has fact in his statement prudent who found to according 120 of the é of the Senate of the 4 November where he has said : 
honourable senators , the bill of bill C - 6 will the apply to all the sectors of activity , regardless of the size of the businesses . 
that includes also the sector of the health . 
he will allow of protect the information personal in the of health who have been collected , used and releases in the framework of activities trade . 
Mr. . Manley and the Department of the Industry have indicated for their share that the bill of bill not the applies not to the doctors , to the patients and to the hospitals . 
I wish to say that this point of view is has in question and , in fact , challenged by of many parties interested and their counsel legal . 
this is the case by example of the Association Canadian of the care of health , who represents the hospitals of the Association medical Canadian , of the Association medical of the Ontario and of the Department of the Health of the Ontario . 
he the is that of agencies who have a point of view diamétralement opposed on the further of the bill of bill and this that . should in do . 
yet , they are of agreed on a point , be that the sector of the health not can live with the doubt and the confusion surrounding this bill of bill in this who respect the application to the sector . 
the confusion result in part of the least of the fact that the bill of bill is supposed the apply to the " activities trade " . 
that does - . by that ? 
. said in the bill of bill that a " activity commercial " is : 
any activity due and that all act isolated who are a uniqueness commercial ... 
this definition not is not very useful . 
yet , . me said that the laws federal are pleines of regarding who are almost identiques to the - this in this who has relates to the activity commercial . 
the idea is that . it to the courts the be of decide in each case this who is a activity commercial . 
the hon. Fernand Robichaud ( His the the Speaker Acting ) : 
honourable senators , the time of speak of the senator Murray has expired . 
leave is - she granted to the hon. senator of continue ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Murray : 
I thank the honourable senators for their kindness . 
frankly , I not me am never stopped to the rule who limit to 45 minutes the intervention of the senator who does . 
I not me was not the the that I had past as of time on the first part of my intervention . 
I not in I more for very long . 
the question is of know if the relationship doctor - patient , in the legislation where he there has of the for , or the relationship Hospital - patient , still a time in the legislation where he there has of the for , are of nature commercial . 
that they the be or not , he there has when same a problem . 
I quote : 
according the AMC , he not there has not really way of do a distinction between the activity commercial and the activity of care of health of a way who being of the ensure that the information formula in the matter medical be subject to of the rules different of those which are covered the other information . 
that same if a such distinction was possible , the dilemma would the same for the government because would - he desirable that the issues medical not be subject to no rule ? 
other said , the agencies who stood now of the information on the health will - they argue that they not are not subject to the provisions of the bill of bill C - 54 because that this information fact part of the matter of health ? 
as you the know , the number C - 54 is the who had been was to this bill of bill to the opportunity of the session before . 
the or the on : 
in under of a such regime , the issues of health would subject to of the criteria least high that those who have over for the information collected in the context commercial . 
this is that the expression of a point of view . 
the same opinion is position by the Association Canadian of the health , who represents the hospitals . 
she the based on a opinion legal that she has obtenue of the s of lawyers Heenan Blaikie of Montreal , who specific this who following : 
... not only the expression " activity commercial " is - she very ambiguously , but she is also completely achievable to our notice in the context of the system of health of today today . 
, the over of the last years , the system of health is became a system of services if complex and if transparent that any legislation to to exclude only the " activity commercial " of the system of health to the for of the bill of bill C - 54 resulting only to of the results illogiques , leadership and ridiculous . 
I not want not streamline exagérément the question but , in rule general , he is to my notice fair of say that the agencies of the area of the health which the activities are clear and indubitablement of order commercial the opposed to this bill of bill and looking that all the sector of the health 730 to his provisions . 
when I about of " these " agencies , I want say between other the pharmaciens , the Laboratories and the businesses who stood , pay and vendent of the data of the area of the health , under a form overall or other , and some agencies of research and universities which the activities understand a track commercial . 
they feel that the obligation of obtain the consent of the people before of to of the data in the of health is too onéreuse . 
, their notice , this prerequisite restrain seriously their ability to meet a body of information integrated to to all to a better policy and to a better management in the area of the health . 
they suggest same hear that this bill of bill the translate by a backsliding serious of the research medical to the country . 
the Ontario Campaign Association states that the bill of bill is entities with the Act on the doctors and the Act on the consent to the care of health . 
, their notice , the laws provincial should have above . 
all these people believe that the to of protocoles interprovincial would more effective that a bill federal for ensure the protection of the information on the care of health . 
, the time current , I must say that of other people well to the fact of the laws provincial not are not also optimistic . 
in fact , . said sometimes that the bill Ontario is a bill on the access to the information rather that on the protection of the information . 
I not want not say by that that the Ontario Campaign Association and the Association Canadian of the care of health not the interested not to the protection of the information on the care of health . 
he there has still that use to the level of the values , or to all the least of the priorities . 
the presentations by by these groups this of the concerns that I hustings of institutionnelles opposite to the ability to manage , to being and to improve the system of care of health . 
they are that this bill of bill freine the cooperation between the sectors public and private in this who has relates to the funding or to the Benefit of the care of health . 
I I same read in a of the presentations that that could prevent the Cross Bleue or the Bouclier rein of the Canada of duties their responsibilities in Ontario in the area of the care of health . 
he would , according them , difficult , even same impossible for the government federal of to in implement the recommendations of the Council Advisory on the infostructure of the health who has presented the report in February 99 . 
, the while , we we the were expressed very drew by the Association medical Canadian and by the Association dental Canadian . 
the Association medical Canadian says that the protection of the confidentiality of the matter medical of the patient must the just on any other consideration . 
she find that this bill of bill is low . 
she Justice that the Code of the Association Canadian of normalisation on which the based the bill of bill is inadéquat in this who has relates to the sector of the health and she believes , as she the has said , that the bill of bill seems have the access to the information for value " . 
the Association dental Canadian we has said that we must clarify the bill of bill on several other points important . 
she says that the bill of bill C - 6 not uniting not to answer to the requirements fundamental for protect the Canadians against the bad use of information personal regarding their health by of the users high and tertiaires of this information . 
the bill of bill C - 6 allows can - be of wasn several priorities of the government in the of trade Ministerial , said the ADC , but she believes that the Senate must do someone something for clarify and strengthen the bill of bill in this who respect the information personal in the of health . 
the Association medical Canadian and the Association dental Canadian have all two public of the amendments that they want that we dimensions and who , of after this that I in I including , incorporeraient essentially in this legislation federal their own codifies of protection of the information personal . 
honourable senators , the committee is such to a task difficult and complex . 
before these were who the opposed criticized , same in the area of the health , he would trying of say that the truth ahead someone share between these two were and that the government is probably killed to establish a fair balance with the bill of bill C - 6 . 
he would trying of in happen to this conclusion or of support this argument , but this would really too easy . 
first , the committee will watering of concerning the doubt and the confusion to comments of the applicability of the bill of bill to the sector of the health . 
this is a area really too important . 
the protection of the information personal in the of health is too important for let this sector in the confusion . 
he is clear that the professionals in this area not can the accept because they we the have said . 
if the bill of bill not is not clarifié , the - this risk , a time adopted , of be more often breached that respected . 
no of between we not wish that he in be and . 
same if we can eliminate the doubt who there as to the application of the bill of bill , that répondons - we to the Association medical Canadian and to the Association dental Canadian , who insistent to that the legislation legislative be substantially stipulates ? 
should - we try of apply the provisions to all the sector of the health , as commercial that not commercial ? 
if we the do , we - we truly the power constitutional of act of the so ? 
finally , he must absolutely hear Health Canada relatively to this question . 
for as that I far , no representative of Health Canada not is come testify during of the hearings of the committee of the House of the Commons . 
the committee and the Senate must benefit of the views of the Department of the Health relatively to all the aspects of the bill of bill who touch the sector of the health . 
personally , I not wish not to this that the Minister come testify , but the committee should certainly invite of the senior officials of the Department of the Health to come examine this legislation legislative , the given that the - this one the health . 
honourable senators , we we many of work to do . 
on - we to the task , but not rush not the things . 
not we imposons not of will artificiels when he the is of a question also important . 
this time - this , we not we not to we preoccupied of a prorogation . 
we can take the time necessary . 
honourable senators , I you thank of your indulgence . 
the hon. Sheila Finestone : 
honourable senators , I I listened with great interest the criticism urgently of our hon. colleague . 
he we remind and heritage the importance of the question of the right to the life privacy , essentially , the right that . we it tranquilles . 
I believe that this is the Justice Brandeis who has said that we had the right that . we it tranquilles , and I am well of agreed with him . 
the question is of know if this bill of bill does to the two criteria following . 
the Prime is a criterion economic and the second respect the justice social . 
a great number of the senators who the find today today in opposite of me understand the dilemma who is to balance justice economic and justice social of a manner who be equitable for them and for the people that we we the privilege of represent in this House , and that for all the people to which we inspire a very sentiment of responsibility . 
honourable senators , this is with a wear any particular that I about today today of the bill of bill C - 6 . 
I me recall that , of the time where I at to the other place , he the was the bill of bill C - 54 , Act on the protection of the information personal and the documents electronic . 
my wear is of as more great that the a of the responsibilities and of the duties which I am the more proud has been of serve in as that chairman of the committee Standing of the rights of the human and of the condition of the people disabilities of the other place . 
we we the of the hearings on a great variety of questions regarding the life privacy and , in 1997 , we we prepared a report entitled : " - life privacy : 
where the at the border ? " 
we we heard of the stories enough troublantes to the about of the treatment " to the people disabilities and of the rights of the human who not were not well protected . 
we we heard speak of the challenges that represents the new Technology to the level of the protection of the rights of the citizens of in prevent some of smells in their life privacy and of use the information that they découvrent to of the for forerunners . 
our research me have fact discover the many facets complex that there this question . 
he rest still many of work to do for strengthen our rights basic . 
today today , I traiterai in particular of the part 1 of the bill of bill and of the protection of the information personal in the sector private . 
that not falling in nothing my reserves as to the second part of the bill of bill who the on the documents electronic . 
the provisions of the part 2 of the bill of bill are essential for facilitate the trade Ministerial who is became if important for the economy Canadian current and which the importance not will that increase to the over of the years . 
for the time , I like particularly me focus on the definition of the protection of the life privacy and of the use of the information personal . 
the provisions of the bill Bill C - 6 to to ensure the protection of the life privacy are a great not in the good direction , particularly to the " of those who constataient the none need of better protect this right . 
in suggesting the principles of the protection of the data recognized internationalement to the businesses private of resort federal , the bill of bill parliament to a regime exhaustive of protection of the life privacy . 
of the laws on the protection of the information personal and on the trade Ministerial are already in are of be completed in Europe , in the Union European , to the OECD , in Nova - Zealand and in Australia . 
the Americans are concerned because that they not have not of mechanisms precise of protection of the information commercial . 
they élargissent now the scope of this protection for power strengthen their activity commercial . 
we we also need of do of the trade , honourable senators . 
I am pleased that we we dirigions in this seaway through to this bill of bill . 
I remind to the honourable senators that the protection of the information personal not is not a something to which . can think after the in a society democratic . 
the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy , Bruce Phillips , the ' of these questions , of same that of those who matters of the Act on the access to the information . 
these two laws can sometimes enter in conflict , but all two have for obligation of protect all the citizens . 
the Act on the protection of the information personal act the Clinic , the use and the communication of information personal by of the institutions government . 
she is very tough and has been effective until here . 
, my notice , the Commissioner Phillips the is very well great of this service . 
the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy of the Canada has supported that the force who anime the companies décentes is the respect of the principle of equity . 
we must we deal the each the other with a level reasonable of respect . 
we not must not we expressed in cachette with of the information that we can use against of other people . 
the bill of bill C - 6 is to ensure the respect of this principle of equity and of décence . 
, my notice , the bill of bill has reached the balance delicate who the is between the need for the businesses Canadian of have access to of the information personal for exercise their activities and the need for all the citizens of control the Clinic , the use and the communication of the information who the with . 
he is came to good number of between we of have a managed to the letters who déborde of new mail of all kind . 
we we asking then to what magazine we we taken a abonnement or still what Purchase we we fact to the way of a card of credit , of so that we understand this that we receiving to our the , in the mail and by the through of our telephone , and we not are not surprise . 
this who we every , this is that our names be sold . 
each of we is a subject of trade , a marchandise . 
in what legislation want - we control this marchandise for protect of the information personal ? 
the effort for establish a balance is obvious in the clause supply the subject of the bill of bill . 
I agree that the legislation has need of be amendée and clarifiée . 
I know if we will do a compromise and we hear , but I would certainly more to the comfortable if this question was the subject of a review more thorough . 
the provisions on the protection of the life privacy recognize that we greatest in a era where the Technology removing of more in more the flow and the Exchange of information . 
this is a wording that he not would not forget . 
the bill of bill C - 6 not is not a panacea for all the threats to the life privacy which are opposite all the companies democratic modern , but he the touch on a part important who is the possible that of the information personal be are to of the organizations to the Canada . 
the bill of bill would to the consumers of the rights in this who respect the information personal who the with , all in complying the need legitimate of the businesses of to and of use these information . 
the consumers must have confidence - this is very important with Internet - and we must promote this confidence . 
for that our businesses equipped and grandissent , they must establish a link of confidence with those who use their services . 
by therefore , the confidence that has the so that his information personal will protected in the transactions electronic is absolutely basic . 
in same time , the efforts for protect the information to on of the individuals not must not lead unnecessarily of the costs for the businesses . 
the new legislation legislative require that the businesses the conforment to the together of practices field of treatment of the information the to the point by the representatives of the industry . 
the groups of Defence of the consumers , the unions , the government and various sectors of the area of the health have been consulted for this legislation legislative of the Association Canadian of normalisation . 
this is that , I believe , a broader representation of the concerns and of the needs to take in consideration . 
the practices field of treatment of the information which he is question the repeatedly the Code type of the Association Canadian of normalisation . 
this Code is in into since 1996 and is joined in Printed to the bill of bill . 
he has been the to the point by the society civil , the businesses , the industry , the professionals and the NGOs . 
a of the amendments would relevant in the here because he the is of a description very broader who covers a broad wide of businesses trade to the Canada . 
this Code establishes the obligations of the businesses who stood , use and ministerial of the information personal . 
the businesses must indication to the people to what for the data are allow , obtain their consent before of use or of to the information , ensure to this that the information be well those who are necessary for the for which they must serve - not not not any what for , but well the for which they have been collected - and protect the information by of the measures of security legitimate . 
the standard national establishes also the right of the issues of the data of see and of correct their issues and of the concern in case of problems . 
these people can the address to someone a in the business who seems use to bad escient or difficulty to the information and from that a responsible the ' of the problem and take the measures appropriate . 
he there will without doubt a debate on the improvements to to to the bill of bill for the to more effective . 
I remind to the honourable senators that a bill of bill is rarely perfect in his form original ; in fact , little of things are parfaites in this world well imparfait . 
the evolution of this legislation legislative we montrera in what sense we orienter for to of the amendments who improve the effectiveness on the plan of the protection of the information personal all in complying the interests legitimate of the businesses Canadian in any the legislation of the possible . 
a senator has asked a question to the about of the together of the services of health . 
I know the AMC , and I believe understand that she applies the oath of Hippocrate , a Code of conduct and a Code of Ethics . 
all the doctors , dentists and pharmaciens must the there conform . 
that not to not necessarily say that we must have all a patchwork hétéroclite of measures for prevent any they to the right to the protection of the identity and of the information personal to the Canada . 
honourable senators , I I been very pleased of see that . had made of the changes to the bill of bill presented to the departure to the other place . 
he there has had 16 amendments , and a sure number of between them have answered to number of my questions and of my concern . 
and , the definition of the information personal has been amendée . 
the amendment is very important , because the expression reclassification now all this who the quoted to a individual identifiable . 
that the applies to of the things as the caméras of monitoring , the caméras placées in the washrooms , the information medical and dentaires , the information of order revamped , the pharmacies who livrent the pharmacare , and the research . 
however , for we prémunir against any mistake - that is crucial , because our information personal a time perdus , not can be typical - , he is vital that the definition the étende to the members of the professions Liberal and to the NGOs . 
I like that we apportions a amendment to this clause where the . find the regarding . 
if I not me read , this clause the find in the part 1 , to the clause 2 , that just of read the senator . 
this clause define this that he must hear by activity commercial . 
that is - this that a activity commercial ? 
the he the is of a activity commercial , the activity in because should be couverte and she should understand of the professionals and of the agencies without purpose profit . 
I believe that we réglerions and some of the problems who have been raised by various agencies . 
honourable senators , then - I complete , with your leave ? 
the the the Speaker : 
the leave is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Finestone : 
he the is of information related to of the people human identifiables and , frankly , I not like not think to them in as that groups or cercles different . 
essentially , if the information that you you me respect and that you the " obtenue because that I you the I demandée for my police of insurance , of the services of health , of the services medical or dentaires , this information me is and she me respect . 
as my grandchildren - children the say , she is to me . 
she is to me and human not can the the commandeer if we pass this bill of bill properly . 
the right of not not be identifiables by those which we not wish not be known - short , the right of not not be importunés - must be guaranteed in the clause of the bill of bill where are contained the regarding . 
I like well that we parvenions to the do . 
I hope that the Minister acceptance of amend this definition and that he ups to this that she specific that he we any little of where has been abdomen this information or how she is that in the world commercial if the interested who the has obtenue not had not the right of the do - he not had not my leave , he not has not from my whatsoever and I not want not that he that this information in his possession . 
he must also examine the question raised to the ( 7 ( 3 ) f ) of the bill of bill relatively to the communication of data to of the for of research . 
many of people the alleged of the use of data to of the for of research . 
he there has way of use of the data without identify the people . 
he not there has no reason for that . not can not the do . 
. can lead of the research without opportunity the identity of the people . 
the question fall by this clause is the end word of the history . 
short , honourable senators , this bill of bill is excellent same the he must be developed and thorough to some places . 
I believe that the bill of bill C - 6 , who fact part of the strategy necessary to this end , will the favour of the House and become bill . 
I believe that we able do case without problem with the Union European . 
I believe that we respecterons the criteria of the OECD . 
more important still , I believe that we protégerons the information personal of all the world . 
( on the motion of the senator Oliver , the debate is adjourned . ) 
- honourable senators , I am particularly pleased of speak in favour of the bill of bill S - 10 , who is to amend the Act on the Defence national , the Act on the identification by the fingerprints génétiques and that the Code criminal . 
this bill of bill there in a broad legislation through to the Senate and more specifically to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional . 
this bill of bill represents the What of a commitment that the Solicitor General has taken the fall last when the committee examinait the new Act on the identification by the fingerprints génétiques . 
as you you in recall can - be , this bill for the to of a bank national of data génétiques who will of maintain the profile of identification was of individuals who have made of the crimes serious and violent . 
during the review , the committee has noticed that the bill of bill not provided no clause Motion the levy of marine , on of the Offenders cannot guilty of offences serious and violent and traduits in the framework of the system of justice military , levy which the results are then paid in the bank of data génétiques . 
the committee has expressed his concerns as to the nature extremely sensitive of the data génétiques , to the evolution quick of the Technology regarding the fingerprints génétiques and to the risk of to they to the life privacy of the Canadians of manner imprévue . 
these concerns had country the committee to recommend , in the sixteenth report , of to some improvements to the measures legislation with the bank of data génétiques . 
the Solicitor General the was committed to give the to these recommendations in carcinogens a bill of bill distinct before the implementation in place of the bank national of data génétiques . 
given given that the bill of bill S - 10 does to of the questions raised to the Senate , the Solicitor General has asked wording that he be presented to the Senate before the other place . 
I am am that we apprécions all this initiative deM . 
I so now to the content of the bill of bill . 
he the is of a bill of bill are technical , truffé of clauses to of other laws , but , essentially , his major elements are very simple . 
all of first , the bill of bill amend the Act on the Defence national and the Act on the identification by the fingerprints génétiques of manner to include in the bank national of data génétiques the profiles of the individuals recognized guilty of offence to the Code of discipline military or of offences serious and violent . 
the Code the applies to the staff military , to the Reserves and to some civilians who accompanies the military to the abroad . 
the system of profiles of identification was established by the bill of bill S - 10 for the they following very closely the model of the system that the Parliament has created for the civilians . 
, the the of a condemnation for the offence pantheon , the judges military will therefore the power of Appear the levy of échantillons of marine , on of the people justiciables of the Code of discipline military . 
the provisions of this bill to relates to the Building of mandates are adjusted to the through of the context military . 
and , the police military can ask of the mandates regarding the his génétiques when she enquêtera on of the offences of order military who are comparable to the offences high définies in the Code criminal . 
the changes Whelans of the improvements notables to the bill in into . 
in the of present of the things , the police military can the address to a Justice of a court provincial for obtain a mandate relatif to of the his génétiques in the framework of the inquiry on a offence pantheon commise to the Canada , but she not can not obtain this mandate if the offence has been commise to the abroad . 
the list of the offences désignées found in the Code criminal not includes not some offences serious to the words of the Act on the Defence national or some offences to uniqueness strictly military , by example , the esteemed with violence . 
the bill of bill will to the judges military the power of render of the mandates debates to the his génétiques in case of offences to the Act on the Defence national of so that the police military can lead of the investigations police more effective as to the Canada that to the abroad . 
a second series of changes made in this bill of bill does directly to the recommendations of the committee Senate . 
this bill of bill give to the Senate the same power that the House of the Commons for this who is of examine the Act on the identification by the fingerprints génétiques five years after his Recognition . 
these changes improve specifically to give to the Parliament the tools necessary for monitor the effectiveness of the bank of data on a some period , this who was a concern of the Senate . 
the third Main part who is amended is the statement of the principles of the Act on the identification by the fingerprints génétiques , who is expanded . 
he will indicated that the marine , random and the profiles génétiques through to from of these marine not can be used that to the for of application of the bill . 
this amendment is to answer to the concerns of the committee Senate to the about of the bad use possible of the profiles génétiques , by example for determine the makes medical , physical or mentales of a human . 
in fact , that base some of the questions raised during the debate on the information personal . 
this bank of data has for subject of identify the people , as . can already the do to the way of the fingerprints photographed . 
he not the is not and he not the Glenney never of compiler of the information of order staff . 
of the changes made to the Code criminal will of protect also against all bad use the data génétiques of the people justiciables of the Code of discipline military . 
the other changes of this bill will for effect of clarify and of strengthen the regime of levy of marine , . 
pursuant to the new principle which I just of you speak , the Code criminal will amended of so that the system of justice military will also subject to the shut of use to of the for not allowable the marine , random and the results of their analysis was . 
finally , this bill of bill there a sure number of changes of order practice to the Code criminal to of ensure the implementation in implement of the Act on the identification by the fingerprints génétiques . 
the Code criminal is therefore clarifié to this regard since he there is said that the something not has not to be orderly if the lawyer of the Crown informed the court that the profile was of the human fall the find already in the bank national of data génétiques . 
. make and the system more effective and . RESPs the Estimates outlive occasionnées by the Clinic and the analysis in double of the échantillons of marine , bailed on the offenders chronic . 
in the case where of the offenders are forwarded in a other province before that a order of levy of a échantillon not that been exécuté , the judges of courts provincial will approve the order or the Authorized who has been " in the province of where people the offenders in question . 
two provisions of the Code criminal , who not were not still in into , will abrogées to because of the consequences negative that they would for the Administration of the justice . 
he the is of the obligation , for a officer of the peace , of inform a human fall by a order or a mandate relatif to the his génétiques that she can express his Prime as to the substance corporelle to levies - blood , salive or flash - and of the obligation of the officer of the peace of to the of the Prime position . 
these provisions pose a problem because that nothing in the right pénal not " the police to let a human who fact the subject of a inquiry choose the way of Clinic of the elements of evidence . 
who more is , as the have underlined the representatives of the provinces and of the territories , the judges prescrivent already in the mandates the procedure of inquiry to follow , and if . it the human choose , that conservative to do an his decision against the of a Justice . 
a other clause of the Code criminal will abrogée . 
she respect the into did in the bank of data génétiques of the results of the inquire of marine , Debates volunteers or through in under of a mandate Motion the too of his génétiques during the inquiry . 
the Laboratories court Canadian have fact know that they not were not in favour of enter the results of the inquire of marine , and the profiles génétiques who in clauses in the bank of data in these case - that , because the marine , and the profiles generic are usually retained for serve of room to conviction to the case where he there would a new trial . 
in addition , the échantillons bailed in under of a mandate Motion of such inquire , contrary to those who will bailed for the bank of data after the condemnation , are assortis of codifies of identification personal . 
he will therefore more difficult for the RCMP of protect the rights to the life privacy of the individuals , and that the 6 the Act on the identification by the fingerprints génétiques . 
for avoid all problem , . consider now necessary of levies of new échantillons of marine , each time that he there has a order for their inclusion in the bank of data , this is - to - say after the condemnation . 
in conclusion , the bill of bill S - 10 move some amendments to the Act on the Defence national , to the Act on the identification of the fingerprints génétiques and to the Code criminal in view of allow the implementation in place effective of a bank of data of data génétiques complete . 
not only he give the to the recommendations of the committee Senate , but in more he affine the bill on the bank of data to of the for of application practice . 
taken together , these changes are we we in this House taken a share important undoubtedly to protect the right of the Canadians to the life privacy all in dotant the police , for his investigations , of a tool of high technicité who will of improve the security public . 
( on the motion of the senator Kinsella , to the behalf of the senator Nolin , the debate is adjourné . ) 
bill of bill of 99 for the implementation in Bill of conventions tax 
second Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
- honourable senators , I am pleased of begin the debate to the step of the second Reading of the bill of bill S - 3 . 
this text legislative has for subject of to in implement of the conventions tax treaties between the Canada and seven country - the Kirghizistan , the Lebanon , the Algeria , the Bulgaria , the Portugal , the Ouzbékistan and the Jordan - with which the Canada not has not of conventions tax in into now . 
the bill of bill the also creation of a new convention replacement the convention current with the Luxembourg and the in implement a protocol who amend of the parties of the convention reached with the Japan . 
before of alters the bill of bill , I like take a time for establish the context in which he the recorded . 
, the time where the regime of the tax on the income of the Canada has been examined and it in 1971 , he in has including peel a Rich of our system of conventions tax with of other country . 
, the time current , of the conventions tax between the Canada and 65 country are in into . 
honourable senators , he you intéressera can - be of know that since 1976 , 24 bills of bill of conventions tax have been tabled to the Parliament . cases the two last years only , of the conventions or of the protocoles have been through with 14 country . 
the conventions tax are particularly important for the Canada because that they are directly related to the trade international of products and of services and that they have therefore a impact direct on their performance economic domestic . 
this impact is great . 
the exports Canadian are now more of 40 per of our happened within gross annual . 
in addition , the health economic of the Canada each year based also on the Investment abroad direct and that on the influx of information , of capital , of Technology , of royalties , of dividends and of interests . 
he is therefore obvious that the conventions tax for in the bill of bill S - 3 profiteront to the businesses and to the special Canadian who exercise of the activities and who hold of the investment in these country . 
the taxpayers Canadian will including happy of learn that a rate of tax set by convention not can be increased without a long notice . 
of more , of the simple fact of their existence , the conventions tax créeront a climate of certainty and of stability for the investors and the négociants . 
this climate not can that improve the relations economic that indications the Canada with each of these country . 
in addition , in eliminating the need of pay of the tax on some profits of business and in by a mechanism of regulation of the problems Deployment by the taxpayers , he will possible of reduce the grow and the incommodité of the regime tax as such . 
the fact of streamline the regime of the conventions tax stimulate the activity international , this who will a effect favourable on the economy Canadian . 
finally , the Elimination or the atténuation of the double tax who could other time in the framework of the operations international will the more great advantage . 
if the . the in the the convention who is the in into with the Luxembourg , the new conventions for in the bill of bill S - 3 improve two great objectives : avoid the double tax and prevent the Seniors tax . 
these problems are already taken in consideration in the convention in into with the Japan . 
I me deregulation of attention that in the case of the conventions tax pensioners , these conventions are greatly s of the model of double tax prepared by the Organization of cooperation and of development economic . 
the possible of double tax declared when a taxpayer ahead in a country and that he earner a income in a other country . 
without convention tax , the two country can clamour of the tax on this income . 
the conventions of double tax are in so that the same income not can be imposed two time . 
the conventions tax treaties by the Canada the attack to this problem of two ways . 
first , in taxation the rights of tax between the country of residence of the taxpayer and the country of origin of the income . 
second , if the income is however tax in the two country , in require of the country of residence that he consider the income as the Board of tax or in easier a credit to the as of the tax paid to the country of origin . 
of same , the conventions of double tax exceptions the Exchange of information between the authorities tax in view of prevent the Seniors or the evasion tax . 
this is the second objective of these conventions . 
the sharing of the information assistance the authorities tax to cerner the case of Seniors and of evasion tax and to there which . 
in this who has relates to the conventions for in the bill of bill S - 3 , each country treated the relief who is to the as of the tax paid in the other country part to the convention tax . 
the Canada and the other country apply usually of the taxes of restraint to various types of income of not - residents . 
the country of where is nothing the income can clerical of the taxes but to a rate who the limit usually to 5 , 10 or 15 per on the dividends and the profits of the for and to 10 per in the case of the interests and of the royalties . 
in some case , the royalties payées to the as of the rights of author , of the software , of the patents and of the know - do are exonérées to the source . 
the convention reached with the Kirghizistan , by example , limit the rate of the restraint of tax to 15 per in the case of the dividends , of the interests and of the profits of for and à10p. per in the case of the royalties . 
he there some exonérations for this who is of the interests and that of the royalties on the rights of author , the software , the patents and the know - do . 
the convention reached with the Lebanon for a restraint of tax of 5 per on the dividends paid to a society who Canada to the least 10 per of the Senators of the society who toward the dividends and of 15 per in all the other case . 
the profits of for and the royalties on the rights of author , the software , the patents and the know - do will imposed to a rate of 5 per and the interests to a rate of 10 per . 
for the Algeria , a tax of 15 per will had in the case of all the dividends , interests and royalties , and some exonérations are for for the interests and the royalties on the software and the patents . 
the convention reached with the Bulgaria for the application of a restraint of tax of 10 per on the dividends fellows to a society holding to the least 10 per of the Senators of the society who toward the dividends , and of 15 per in all the other case . 
for this who of the convention reached with the Portugal , a society must have to the least 25 per of the Senators of the society who toward the dividends for have right to a restraint of tax de10p. per on the dividends . 
a restraint of 15 per the apply in all the other case . 
a restraint of 10 per the apply also to the interests and royalties , to few reservations close for the interests . 
in this who has relates to the Ouzbékistan , the rate of restraint of tax who the apply to the dividends fellows to a society who Canada to the least 10 per of the Senators of society who toward the dividends will of 5 per and of 15 per in all the other case . 
a rate of 10 per the apply to the interests and to the royalties , and a tax of 5 per will prélevé on the rights of author , the patents , the software and the know - do . 
the new convention reached with the Jordan establishes à10p. per the restraint of tax who the applies to the dividends fellows to a society holding to the least 10 per of the Senators of the society who toward the dividends , and to 15 per , the who the applies in all the other case . 
the convention for also a restraint of 10 per on the interests and the royalties , some exonérations the suggesting to the interests on the 1993 government and guaranteed by the government . 
the bill of bill S - 3 is the current convention of 1989 reached with the Luxembourg and for the application of a restraint of tax of 5 per on the dividends for a society who Canada to the least 10 per of the Senators of the society who toward the dividends , and of 15 per in all the other case . 
a rate of 10 per the apply to the interests and to the royalties , of new to few reservations close for the interests and the royalties on the software , the patents and the know - do . 
the bill of bill S - 3 amend also the current convention of 1986 reached with the Japan . 
the protocol with the Japan fact to of 10 to 5 per the tax had on the dividends between companies and he éclaircit a sure number of other provisions . 
in addition , the protocol the specifically on the question of the taxes Japanese of business in exonérant of these taxes the companies Canadian who have of the ships or of the aircraft in the area of the transportation intercontinental , a legislation of courtesy already granted by the provinces Canadian to the companies Japanese who exercise of the activities similar . 
honourable senators , the conventions that contains the bill of bill S - 3 them also on of other questions of conventions tax . 
by example , the country of origin can impose the gains in capital made to the Divestiture of a well estate , of active commercial and of actions in the companies real or of the participation in of the real or of the companies of people real . 
the discrimination based on the nationalité of a taxpayer is closed . 
however , the measures incitatives as the deduction granted to the small businesses and the credit of tax for dividends which benefit the Canadians not are not affected . 
before of conclude , I like me look on the question of the migrations of the taxpayers . 
four of the conventions for in this bill of bill held the of a some way of the rules on the migration of the taxpayers who have been proposed by the Minister of the Finance and who will part of the bill of bill budget of 99 . 
these proposals improve to amend the Act of the tax on the income of way to this that the Canada retained the right of impose the gains made by the immigrants during their stay here . 
, the time of to public the bill of bill in December last , the Minister has announced that the Canada renégocierait his conventions tax for to the of the new rules to of avoid the double tax . 
and , in pending that these rules have force of bill , the Canada has rigorous his conventions tax of manner to avoid the double tax to the time where the gains made by of the immigrants , before their departure , are mobile . 
in this who respect the bill of bill S - 3 , the conventions with the Luxembourg , the Portugal , the Lebanon and the Jordan held the of the migration of the taxpayers . 
however , the conventions with the Ouzbékistan , the Bulgaria , the Algeria and the Khirghizistan not in held not the the given that they have been négociées before the announcement of the proposals . 
the Japan has asked that this question of the migration of the taxpayers be working in the framework of future negotiations surrounding the convention . 
for conclude , I like out that the conventions tax that contains this bill of bill are conçues for relieve the double tax international of the income transferred of a country to a other . 
these conventions tax will of do in so that the political tax Canadian be colleague uniformément to the operations treaties with the Khirghizistan , the Lebanon , the Algeria , the Bulgaria , the Portugal , the Ouzbékistan , the Jordan , the Japan and the Luxembourg . Elles créeront also a climate of stability for the investors and the négociants Canadian in these country . 
honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 3 is a text legislative of nature day who is a tax equitable and the keeping of good relations international and trade . 
the equity of the regime tax - who , as we the know all , is a priority of the state - demands that no Canadian not the find taken to the piège of the double tax . 
however , these conventions tax improve specifically to eliminate the double tax . 
before of conclude , I like out the work magnificent of the team of experts who have informed this process long and accordance of our government . 
these officials have served the interests of the Canada under the habile direction of their Minister respectif to the Finance and to the Justice . 
they deserve all our thanks . 
as this text of bill not raises no controversy , I you urge urge to the support . 
( on the motion of the senator Lynch - Lynch , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the speech of the seated 
motion of Adopted of the Adresse in response - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator MLA , seconded by the hon. senator Furey , Honourable to the Adopted of a Adresse to His Excellency the Gouverneure general in response to the speech that her has given during of the opening of the second session of the 30 - sixth session Parliament . - 
( 3e day of the resuming of the debate . ) 
the hon. William Kelly : 
honourable senators , I am delighted of see that as of senators of this side - this be nothing for me hear this after - afternoon . 
I I therefore well the intention of in benefit to the safeguarded . 
I me commend of the commitment taken in the speech of the Throne " of ensure to this that the Forces Canadian be in legislation of support the role of the Canada for help to the security in the world " . 
cover - we however of under - Number the legislation in which we are held of honour this commitment . 
since 1988 , the Estimates incurred to the as of the Defence national have decreased in $ terms , year after year , to the point that the power of Purchase of the budget of the Defence is today today to little close equivalent to the of the beginning of the years 70 . 
the ways which we begin for buy the equipment necessary and in ensure the maintenance have been particularly affaiblis by the of Funding budget . 
the work of the forces Armed actives , who was of doubling $ people in 1989 - 1990 , should , according the forecasts , fall of 60 $ of here to the end of the year financial in over . 
we not are already more in legislation of Establishing of the units combattantes for the Resistance of land , be the minimum acceptable for lead a action military sustainable . 
according the data published by the NATO , the Canada the recorded to the last among of the country members for this who is of the troop of the Force due and of the Forces first and high of contingency . 
he there in has who argue that the end of the War Cold has abolish the need of maintain a ability military deeply and permanent and has created a perspective of " advantageous of peace " . 
as I the I often said in this House , I believe that they the trompent completely . 
the threats to the security and their sources have can - be changed , but the world of today today is affiliated more instable , dangerous and unforeseeable that never . 
the possible of conflict local and regional déclenchés by of the mouvements separatists policy is always , in all the across of the chorus . 
the threat of terrorism by of the States renégats and of the groups rebel there always . 
honourable senators , I sphere to believe that the impact international of the failure of some States constitueront the key threat to the security of the Canada and of the Canadians in a future result . 
that this be in Africa , in the former - Union Soviet , in Asia of the South - East , in America core or in America of the South , he so that of the States the désorganisent , as . the has seen already , for various reasons economic , Environmental or political . 
the désintégration of a state creates a vacuum of power that the empressent often of fill of the groups criminals or terrorist who , to their turn , stop the security of the other States . 
. find of the examples of that in the former - Union Soviet . 
the effritement of the power Civil has fact emerging any a series of activities sordides . 
honourable senators , the months last by example , the authorities russes have stopped six people to Vladivostok who the apprêtaient to out of the country six kilogrammes of enriching 4,238 for the sell to the outside . 
this enriching erroneous of a plant where the . démantelait some parties of the conserving nuclear Soviet and of the terrorist or of the groups criminals would could the use for manufacture of the bombs nuclear small certainly , but very destructrices . 
this is to because of threats of this kind that we must stay vigilant and maintain in state a good service of Intelligence of security and a they requested . 
I commend the government of the commitment to the military , but I hope see more of details in the next budget federal . 
the speech of the Throne specific the plans of the government for the arrived of the new millennium . 
. said often that this Prime Minister and the government are of vision . 
he there has many of talk words in the speech of the Throne on the preparation to the new millennium . 
I acknowledge that to several occasions . about of facilitate , by example , the trade Ministerial and the access to Internet , but that not is not a vision overall for ensure the future of the Canada . 
the globalization of the economies means that all the economies among of more in more interdépendantes . 
in fact , soon , he not there will more this that . Order a " economy domestic " . 
he not there will more that a only economy and a only market . 
the economies , the markets and the competition not will not limited by the boundaries national or regional . 
he not there will more of boundaries . 
between - time , all the investors and people of Affairs international critically continually to a review detailed who not would never been possible before , of all the economies domestic , there including the of the Canada . 
the progress in the technologies of the telecommunications , particularly the progress in the trade Ministerial , are that the investment can be through and of the decisions can be taken in millisecondes . 
the capital can enter in a country or in out in a moment . 
the year last , we we been witnesses can - be of the Prime example of the impact of these forces and of the trade Ministerial on the economy of the Nations of the Asia of the South - East and of the Pacific . 
these important fuites of capital constituency a vote of not - confidence by the investors international and the community of the Affairs . 
the impact the are feel of our days in of the country individual , there including to the Canada , and in the world world . 
, the the of the crisis Asian , the over of the dollar Canadian has falling by report to the dollar American then that the cambistes have bought the more of $ American possible for the protect against the earners Asian . 
our exports to the Far - East have suffered then that the crisis has system a further of the price of the products of basic . 
the capital and the businesses not are more from by the geography , the time or the stripes national . 
a economy or a government who not the there not as the Banking , the financial , the courtiers in values securities and the agencies of cotation in the capitales financial the would can do the subject , quickly and time , he is true , of sanctions very unclear . 
same if we not go can - be not that , he not in remains not least that the Canada not has not of other option that of enfiler this that . Order a " corset economic " who shows to all that the Canada is a good place where invest and do of the Affairs to the over of the new millennium . 
the his of allowed will of us this corset economic to of improve the situation of the Canada and of the Canadians to better answer of their requirements and of protect the things who are special for the Canadians and who are part of our way of life , as by example , our system national of care of health . 
what that he in be , to the time where we will to the new millennium , the Canada has many to do . 
the debt overall of the levels federal , provincial and City is too way and continues of at . 
our levels of tax personal are a burden excessive . 
in despite of improvements important who have been made to the over of the two last decades , our economy includes always many of regulations and of paperasserie . 
we are always widely our of the resources natural . 
about 40 per of the GDP of the Canada clauses of the trade of our resources natural . 
he there has always of too many obstacles to the trade , to the Investment and to the mobility of the with - of implement to the country . 
in despite of the progress has made to the over of the last years , our infrastructure of basic in the sectors of the 2004 of water , of the égouts and of the transportation , particularly in the major cities , require of the delicacies and of the improvements important . 
we must do more in view of improve our productivity . 
we must in do more in the sectors of the education , of the research and of the development to of become the kind of society innovatrice and adaptable who will not only survive but who will also vibrant to the over of the next millennium . 
he there always a gap considerable between this that the Canada is and this that he could become . 
, this regard , I commend the government who has taken the commitment in the speech of the Throne of present of new a legislation legislative to to protect the information personal and commercial in a who hamstrung and to recognize the signatures electronic . 
of similar initiatives are essential if the Canada and the Canadians want be in legislation of benefit fully of the opportunities educational by the Internet and the trade Ministerial . 
honourable senators , the évocation of the Laundering of money me remind that the government the is committed in the speech of the Throne to to the focus on the threats new which must do opposite the Canadians , as the Laundering of the money . 
according the Department of the Finance , of 5 to 17 billion of $ , or as I the I read in the newspaper this morning of 17 to 40 billion of $ stand each year smuggled to the Canada or by the through of the Canada . 
the Group of action financial on the Laundering of capital , who the composede 26 country , including the Canada , the Board European and the Council of cooperation of the Gulf Arab , has constantly criticized the sacrifices of the Canada . 
the promise made in the speech of the Throne is encouraging . 
however , we we of the their on the who . 
honourable senators , the fact that the speech of the Throne about insuffisamment of the problem of the Immigration illégale to the and by the Canada me has frankly many gêné . 
we know that to of be prosperous during the next millennium , the Canada must continue of draw of the immigrants of the world world . 
he is however potent that our country not atteigne not his objectives as to the number of immigrants received . 
the Canada has attention 13 per of immigrants of least in 1998 that to the over of the year before . 
we seem know of the difficulties specific for draw of the workers and of the professionals competent . 
however , that not means not that we we close the " on the problem growing of the Immigration illégale to the Canada , in from of various regions of the world . 
he the is of a problem none , which the causes deep resident in our process of recognition of the status of refugee . 
honourable senators , the rectitude policy makes difficult the held of a debate open and rationnel on our political and our procedures related to the status of refugee . 
any human who lancerait a such debate or who visiting in question the quo quo short the risk of be qualifiée of racist or of anti - 1915 . 
he not well to nothing of attention that the most of the immigrants illégaux not fuient not the persecution for their beliefs religious , political or other , but that this are of the refugees that improve their situation economic . 
of same , he not well to nothing of do out that these immigrants illégaux have legalistic the bill Canadian and that this is a very bad manner of begin a new life to the Canada . 
I am enough proud that the committee Special recent on the security that I I chaired that identified and demonstrated the problem growing of the Immigration illégale hosted to the Canada before that he not be very médiatisé and not atteigne the summum of his médiatisation the been last . 
the Immigration illégale to the Canada threat the integrity of any our policy of Immigration . 
those who looking to come to the Canada in the soumettant to all the procedures grab the illégaux the constructive . 
. knows also that a great part of the Immigration illégale is the fact of organizations criminal . 
not only these organizations are particularly méchantes , but they are also pay very sir to the immigrants , to the plans financial and staff , the privilege of come in America of the North . 
a great number of these immigrants are down to the servitude for pay their debts to the gangs criminals , to the " snakeheads " , who the have fact to smuggled to the Canada . 
I I been happy of learn that a Justice of London had recently court four passeurs to of the , of diversion variant between 7 and 14 years . 
according the documents tabled to the court , the passeurs had extorqué about a million of $ to their customers . 
the Justice has qualified their activities of méchantes , occupation and unfeeling . 
we not do of gift to human in or the " on the Immigration illégale . 
those who benefit the more of our laxisme and of our approach naïve of the determination of the status of refugee are the elements criminals who the livrent to this activity . 
we must recognize that the Immigration illégale not is not a problem strictly national . 
if the Canada to work closely with the government American for modernize our border common during the st century , as . the Much in the speech of the Throne , this modernization must do in so that our other boundaries among least poreuses for the organizations of passeurs . 
, my notice , the difficulty not ahead not in our laws , but in their application . 
the problems of application have been at to again occasions . 
the study specifically by the group of work the on at by the former Minister of the Citizenship and of the Immigration has concluded that he not there had not of system effective in place for whether the respect of the conditions cut by the members of Immigration to the claimants of the status of refugee . 
in addition , the Department of the Citizenship and of the Immigration not monitors not the corridors and attack of the most of the claimants of the status of refugee , there including the thousands of people who waiting a audition in the of Immigration or who are under the the of a expulsion . 
. the the fingerprints photographed of the claimants of the status of refugee to the points of into to of power determine the they have a stopped judicial or the they constitute a threat to the security of the state . 
however , the members of Immigration have said to the committee Senate Special that the training and the equipment dactyloscopiques which they have are such that the fingerprints that they taking are to all for practices outlive and of usual simply stored . 
by therefore , we we need not not of new laws or measures , but of a will policy and of the resources necessary for to in implement and apply the laws and the measures existing . 
the detention of immigrants illégaux is clearly a question sensitive . 
contrary to the States - United and to of other country , we not emprisonnons not the immigrants illégaux to least of have of the reasons of believe that they are of the criminals or that they constitute a threat for the security of the state . 
the Minister of the Citizenship and of the Immigration the against to the detention of the immigrants illégaux because that they not have nothing fact of difficulty . 
she believe therefore that the emprisonner would of the least contrary to the Charter of the rights and freedoms . 
, my sense - and I know that this not is not a opinion popular - the immigrants illégaux have fact someone something of difficulty . 
they have was and volunteers breached the legislation Canadian of the Immigration and that should be a reason enough of the emprisonner until to their hearing Current to the recognition of the status of refugee . 
however , the process must be heavy . 
the decisions must come in time timely . 
. not can not have of the people during of the months because that . lack of staff for accomplish the work handcuff . 
finally , honourable senators , I commend the government of the be committed to strengthen the ability of the RCMP and of other agencies of refute the threats to the security public to the Canada and of work with the forces of the order of other country . 
this is commendable , but , I the said , he must decide until where . can go . 
still that , I am anxious of see the details in the next budget . 
honourable senators , to the approach of the new millennium , he is of reflect to the cent last years . 
the century who the work has been dismantling by a instability incredible and of the massacres sanglants without precedent account essentially to the nationalism inconsidéré and to the extrémisme Johansson . 
this was also a century of progress without precedent . 
the people who have lived in Horse not reconnaîtraient more the world of today today . 
he must hope that we we nothing of the lessons of the 20 century and that the progress made we Cohen a new century more fair , least déchiré by the war and the excesses of nationalism and of ideology , where the freedom economic and policy will respected . 
if we we learned our lessons , the next century we réservera to we and to the world world of the opportunities inimaginables . 
finally , honourable senators , in the world complex to which we we followers , I wish the better of the opportunity to the government , to the to the power now and to those who him succéderont . 
he will enormous of wisdom for succeed to the future , many more that by all the years pensioners . 
the hon. B . Alasdair Graham : 
of , , I commend all the honourable senators who have participated to the a of the more important debates parliamentarians of our history . 
I thank in particular the Leader of the government and the Leader of the Opposition for their good words . 
I wish to say to the senator Lynch - Lynch and to all the honourable senators that I their am grateful of their patience , of their good on and of the quality of the advice who me have been easier during the periods of questions and to of other opportunities when the former - Leader of the government has been called to participate , to the over of the two last years and half , to of the trade sometimes enough articulate . 
he there has can - be had few few opportunities where he has been necessary of do call to the assistance of colleagues , but I hope that all the honourable senators understand that I me am always tried of provide the information the more specific and the more complete possible the the of the circumstances . 
honourable senators , when Vaclav Havel , chairman of the Republic tchèque , has taken the speak before the two Houses of the Parliament during of a recent visit to the Canada , he has spoke of a world in full community of a period of changes stewardship . 
" the more great value , this is the humanity " , has he said , " and the state there for serve the well public in leaving the rights and the freedoms the épanouir to their safeguarded . " 
he has then leads the Canada , country who find of new Ways allowing of to the world better and has added that " the Ethics Canadian " from of a deep respect in the country . 
the Ethics Canadian is whose by many of other country , who the shared . 
the chairman Chirac there has fact referring during of the Summit of the Francophonie , to Moncton , when he has described the Canada as the " a broader country who is and find of the rules of coexisting in the peace and the tolerance " . 
as the chairman Clinton , who has the of side the speech prepared to the Les - Tremblant and has spoke with the heart of the importance historic of the federation Canadian , we all , who écoutions , we thought to the grounds thinkers on which has been righteousness our country , to the reform and to the justice social , to the compassion and to the commitment to the people . 
the commitment Canadian to the well public is a concept who the ' to the heart of this community well special . 
he has fact of our society an , civilisée and tolérante a place of hope and of promises for of the million of people of across in the world . 
in listening his woman , His Excellency the Gouverneure general of the Canada , read the speech of the Throne Honourable October last , he me is wished clear that the passion national permanent , the passion for a balance and for the service of the people , the heart of this that we are and the secession of our origins , rest , in spirit , also vital and dynamic that to the all beginning of our history . 
, well of the ways , honourable senators , the speech of the Throne we has propulsés in the future . 
he the the seaway to the Canadians who their to a real identity , to a real affiliation and that to all the values who constitute the touchstone of our identity national in this end of decade difficult and périlleuse certainly , but how passionnante and rich in aventures . 
now that the government has the of the order in the Finance public and that the economy is strong and in full encouraged , we can to to a new era of management public financially responsible , but to face human . 
through to the improvement continues of the health financial of the country , we we efforcerons more of increase the income available of the households Canadian and of allow to the businesses of the country of better support the competition in the economy based on the knowledge . 
we we began to credit the taxes same before the deleting of the deficit budget . 
our strategy balanced we has for of reduce the taxes of someone 16,5 billion of $ on three years and , by the same opportunity , of rayer600 $ Canadians of the roles of tax federal , all in by of the investment key in of the sectors as the acquisition of knowledge and the health , and that the assistance to the boyhood , of the sectors who are really important for the Canadians . We know however that the cuts of taxes not constitute that a part of the équation . 
the Canadians the waiting to many more of the government . 
they preventing the concept that the government not is that a percepteur of taxes and a cash - that he not think that to the results to short term and to the performance net . 
the Canadians not want not of great vertical between the off and the poor . 
the they have agreed the durs with of the last years , graduated that they had the duty of the do in as that citizens of our great country , they have constantly fact know to the powers public that the insurance - illness Universal , by example , not is not négociable . 
they have réaffirmé that the insurance - illness Universal is a touchstone of the identity Canadian . 
of the care of health affordable and of quality are a over of the life to the Canada . 
this is a in of our society , the expression of the compassion who fact of the Canada a country if unique . 
in the speech of the Throne , the government Liberal repeat the commitment firm to maintain the a of the best plans public of the world . 
, the heart of our efforts in the of Innovation the find the instituts Canadian of the health who will the promotion of the research medical to the whose forefront of the Technology in all the regions and all the disciplines and who they a grant of 500 million of $ . 
the government to work with his partners provincial and other on of the approaches beneficial in the of care to home , of insurance - pharmacare and of Benefit of services to of ensure that the Canadians have of the better system of health possible . 
honourable senators , we are to the enter of a new century . 
the knowledge and the Innovation are the pierres angulaires of the success in the world informatisé . 
the speech of the Throne we move a vision of a country who is prepared to before the opportunities educational by a world where the knowledge is synonyme of power . 
in the village occurring , our researchers are in competition with those of the world world , and not not simply with those to the the local . 
they are in competition in a economy , a market world . 
we know very well that that has of the impact important on the policy government because that we missions to a , to the the World , a , where the vision national is vital , where the partnerships play a role key and where the government the in place a structure for better unable the energy extraordinary of the Canadians of all the walks of the society . 
he has was for that work actively in partnership with our universities and our Laboratories , our industries axées on the know , the provinces , our communities , and that our organizations volunteers and our agencies Cultural who are a work excellent and extraordinary . 
the government has recognized that all the Canadians must have access to the acquisition continues of the know and power the an of the promise that represents the revolution hamstrung . 
we believe that the communities branchées not are not and not can be the apanage of those for who the know is synonyme of power . 
they are to all the Canadians . 
our strategy who is to plug the Canadians will of the Canada the country the more branché of the world and she share of the principle that the future of our country will closely with to the creation of a society fair and united in the possible of access to the information . 
in the framework of this strategy , of the initiatives as Rescol , the Program of access community and the program Ordinateurs for the school have for to the Canada of become a real democracy represents on the know , a place where all the Canadians have the possible of taxing in first class on the Highway of the information . 
convinced that the Room of class is the drives of our democracy represents on the know , we we the on at the TAGS Canadian for the equality of the opportunity , who has helped of the hundreds of thousands of Canadians since 1998 and who includes the grant for the savings - studies , the grant for for of study and the scholarships of the millennium . 
we we the in place a infrastructure help to the research . 
this is why we aggravate our support to the regard of the advice granting and we we lançons in a new business audacieuse , be the creation of the 2 $ chaires of excellence in research of the st century in the universities Canadian . 
the chairman of the University of Toronto , Robert Prichard , has out that this initiative to she only équivalait to streams the staff enseignant of a great university almost of the day to the next , a be net of drain incommensurable . 
as the Prime Minister the has said : 
a place where a Environment widest and a good quality of life will of hand , a place where our young understand that gain not is not only a question of share of market , but well a question of value , of service and of commitment to our roots . 
a country who has a Senators moral and which the citizens are profoundly to create a society World sustainable and a world better enraciné in the soil rich of the humanisme . 
this are our children who we bobbing that . 
they we bobbing that with their mention and their dreams , with their hopes and their love , with their ability and their ingenuity , with their " great open on a world better . 
however , the challenges who the looming before them are of size . 
their responsibilities are great . 
honourable senators , this are them , our children , who must conquérir the future . 
the government has taken a commitment to the babies and the children of the Canada . 
we we are engaged to their allow of from of the good at in the life . 
we we are engaged to their offer a homeless , of the food and a Environment widest . 
we want allow to the parents of to the more of time possible with their children during the months who looking their birth . 
we want help the parents who must too often do of the choice difficult between their responsibilities professional and family . 
we want to on at a regime legal who will of ensure the well - be of the children in case of separation or of divorce of the parents . 
we want back more of money in the Budgets of the families Canadian in reducing the taxes . 
yes , our children have of the rights . 
they have the right of hope . 
they have the right of dream . 
they have the right to the equality in this magnificent country who is the ours and who represents a symbol of hope and of promises for of the million of people to the world , the Canada . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , before of do my comments in this debate on the speech of the Throne , I like all of first offer my congratulations and my best best to the Excellency the Gouverneure general to the beginning of this new mandate . 
these 407 Canadians assume a great privilege and a enormous responsibility . 
they used to them only 30 million of Canadians in our Parliament . 
is few - few of the questions who not cessaient of me come to the spirit in handcuff on the speech of the Throne and in handcuff on the Parliament : how the there the ship of the state to the " of the 407 parliamentarians Canadian who are law of the monitor ? 
is - this that the practice of the freedom is more strong or more low ? 
the Canada that we suggest after our stay to the Parliament will he better ? 
in response to these questions , I I been country to the conclusion that our freedoms to the Canada sending on the basic of a so of trinity of institutions fundamental . 
the more high decision to the country , the Court Supreme of the Canada , is the target of attacks corrosives of the share of some cercles . 
some of the attacks the more violent against the judicial are the fact of members Reform of the other place . 
in his response to the speech of the Throne , the Leader of the Party Reform in the other place to said : : 
... the courts have of more in more empiété on the prerogatives of the Parliament to the point where . can say that he is impossible of interpret the speech of the Throne before of have read the of the courts . 
well well , honourable senators , some auditeurs have could find that fun . 
of other have can - be found that this was a proposal original or - . 
personally , I not I not found that fun . 
I not I not found more fun that the Leader of the Party Reform in the other place the this to daylights of criticism the courts of various representations for the judgments people in their assessment of the measures taken by the governments federal , provincial or territorial , by report to the Charter of the rights and freedoms . 
this was as if the courts were in someone so responsible of the existence of the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms . 
I rappellerais quickly to the Canadians that he has was the whatsoever of the two Houses of the Parliament and of nine legislatures legislation provincial for that be agreed the Act constitutional of 1982 . 
he any that we , parliamentarians , évaluions the vision of the government and the programs who in clauses for determine if each of these programs us our courts in of the situations more difficult or least distressing . 
when I I across the speech of the Throne , nothing in this last not me has am that the government had other something to offer that a program vacuum . 
the government seems avoid the criticism political serious in tactical this strategy . 
he policies to the courts the tasks distressing who consistent to interpret of the laws very general or too famous . 
the government not has not known do evidence of enough of leadership , not has not had the vision policy and legislative necessary for do in so that the Parliament works of the manner the to the origin . 
this who night more to the independence and to the role of the power judicial these the time , this is that some levels of government seem difficulty understand the report who should ceased between the power executive and the power judicial . 
the honourable senators have followed very carefully the judgment that has the the Court Supreme in the case Marshall . 
this judgment illegality some rights derogate of treated and has in of the consequences very déplorables in the province that I represents , the New - Brunswick . 
during this time , the Prime Minister wisely the possible that the Court Supreme retienne the judgment in the case Marshall enough long for allow to the government of adopt the regulations necessary for reduce the levels of a . 
same if we such all to avoid this a , we were always to the taken with the question of meddling policy in the business of the more senior court of the country , who shows clear how the power executive starts to play of the muscle in the area judicial and with of institutions who are part of our form of democracy Parliamentary . 
honourable senators , he is dangerous that a Prime Minister ask to the courts of do their business of manner to promote the regime in place . 
the bill is the bill . 
he not must or the plier or the adapt for that she the the case of a party policy who is to the power . 
, this separation least net between the executive and the judicial , he must add the reaction jerk of a great number of parliamentarians , particularly to the other place . 
since the time that I am to the Senate , I I rarely , and I doubt same that this be came , heard a call for deal of emergency a problem serious of order policy or social in to point to the clause of exemption of the Charter . 
yet , we go often the people of the other place say that the clause of exemption can be used for significant a problem . 
the Parliament must take well Custody when a such proposal is worded . 
honourable senators , I consider the Parliament as a of the three major institutions for the year of the freedom to the Canada . 
a review of the number of days of sitting of the various legislatures legislation and of the two Houses is very significant . 
think to the behind that the government has the to to the rentrée Parliamentary this fall . 
the House of the Commons , the institution who is supposed incarner the democracy to the Canada , seat in average least of 120 days each year . 
some parliamentarians the looking why they should the strive of be attendance here and think that this is a may loss of time of sit to the Parliament because that the government to the power not the soucie not the any of their notice . 
in well of the case , same of simple members of the government the grab retirés of a committee by example in way of retribution for the be interestingly to the power central . 
these people - that consider the rules parliamentarians as nothing of more that of the obstacles to preferred in the too of objectives supporters . 
he there also those who are of notice that the St. of the saints , other said the Block Langevin , has all fact for mess the measures and the decisions who are taken by the government present in the framework of the Parliament . 
why the Prime Minister and the ministers of the cabinet not want - they not that the Parliament seat ? 
the response is obvious , honourable senators . 
é the Parliament of his ability of study of the measures legislation and of important questions of appropriate is the technical who has been used by the government present for spokesmen the prerogative of this institution . 
a matter , by example , we give the evidence that the Block of the Centre not is not prepared to allow to the Parliament of the duties of his task . 
if the . the touch to the context surrounding the Agreement final nisga' has , spoken between the nation nisga' has and the province of British - British , . note that he has been signed by the two parties after have been adopted by the Assembly legislative of the British - British and agreed by the Nisga' as . 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
I must interrupt the hon. senator Kinsella and him attention that the period of time allocated for the speech is has . 
honourable senators , the Authorized of continue is - she granted ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , before that the Parliament that had the opportunity of excellent the treaty nisga' has , the Minister of the Affairs Indian the had already signed . 
the obligation of to of the accountable to the Parliament irrite many the Prime Minister and the cabinet , who is became the group of reflection private . 
, the within of the cabinet , the Prime Minister not the summer more of be the Prime among his our . 
the nature up of the government the country also to all the levels . 
the cabinet réprime the participation policy and the contribution of the members of back - some , of the members of the Opposition , of the committees and of the citizens . 
, the level basic , the accountability of accountable to the Parliament by the occupants of the Block Langevin is quasi nowhere . 
this attack fundamental lancée against the responsibility to the Parliament is troubling and deserves that the . the ask if the speech of the Throne clarifie or not the fact that the government is always responsible to the Parliament . 
in our form of government , dérivée of the of Westminster , the responsibility government is the - cornerstone of the practice Parliamentary and , in this paradigm of government , he is felt rodents that the cabinet or the Prime Minister dominent the service policy of the Parliament without that the members of the two Houses not be guarantee consulted . 
I like do out the impuissance of the government to prevent the diminution of our system policy in certainly the university Philip Norton who , issue of the failure of the government to the driver as the require the principle of the responsibility , wrote that with the years , the instruments of the Parliament the are émoussés . 
he unless : 
the government is also became more réticent to book his information to the House . 
... ... ... great powers centralisés one more to those that the . associate normally to a dictatorship autocratique that to those of a government democratic . 
and that : 
the Parliament is the forum central for discuss of the use and of the abuse of power policy . 
I like in ending speak of this third sector to the service of our democracy , this is - to - say the of the agencies volunteers and not government . 
I I been Whip , honourable senators , of see that the speech of the Throne not was no reference to this next Women of the role of the agencies volunteers in the world . 
. not find no support breaking or losing of the agencies volunteers of the share of the government in place . 
this is rather the contrary . 
almost all the promises that the . ' in the speech of the Throne have relates to a legislation whatever business by the government central . 
since the Nations Nations have said the year 2001 Year international of the agencies volunteers , he me seems , honourable senators , that the government would could do a effort for do share of the clause of our country to out the importance of the agencies volunteers not government . 
in conclusion , honourable senators , I like to to the professor Donald Savoie , which we we spoke to several occasions in of other opportunities , and to the thing released recently under the as Governing from the Centre . 
in a analysis tranchante of the powers of the Prime Minister and of the changes s in the powers to the Canada , the professor Savoie states : 
the cabinet , all as the Parliament , is now beyond . 
the real debates political the held of more in more , , and this is also the case of the decisions who are often taken to the over of the meetings federal provincial of the first ministers , during the meetings roadblocks that the first ministers held during the prohibit of Team Canada , in the office of the Prime Minister , to the Council private , to the Department of the Finance , in the agencies international and to the over of by international . 
nothing not seems indication that the human who Canada all the cartes , be the Prime Minister , and the agencies centraux who him allow of focus the power policy to the centre , have the intention of change what that this be . 
the Prime Minister of the Canada is little submitted to the control hospitals , of the least to the within of the government , who the International of act to his way . 
the the of this change of paradigm , . can very well understand the frustration of the members , and sometimes same of the senators , who not have nothing to say to the level of the implementation to the point of the political , and to who . give the order of do current a initiative of the government , often same without reflection no . 
honourable senators , the speech of the Throne is the mechanism who allows to the government present of do share of his way of see the country and of give the their to the operating of this institution . 
he is clear that the basis same of our democracy Parliamentary are species and that the . has not fact great - something for drama the damage . 
the hon. M. DeWare : 
honourable senators , we , to the Senate , are all very aware of the importance of the education post as for the Canadians individually that for the Canada in the together . 
those who fréquentent the colleges , the universities and other institutions of education post in which of the benefits incommensurables . 
that includes the benefits financial who allow to the graduates of , to a level of life better for them - same and their families . 
that includes also of other benefits least tangibles but all also important in words of quality of life , who allow also to the graduates of play a role essential in the contribution of their communities . 
these benefits the transmettent then to the economy and to the society Canadian under the form , by example , of revenues tax more high , of economies of costs of the programs social and of cohesion social increased . 
still more important of our days is the advantage competitive that a people active workforce give to the Canada in the economy World . 
the businesses of the sectors in full growth of the knowledge and of the Technology of forefront investiront more probably in a country where they can would of the graduates well trained émoulus of excellent institutions of education post . 
he is obvious that the government federal recognizes him also the role crucial of the education post to the Canada . 
in the speech of the Throne , he has recognized " the advantage that represents for the Canada a with - of implement who is the more workforce to the world " . 
the government has also should that , to the over of the three last years , he has taken of the measures for from party of this advantage . 
the speech of the Throne has underlined of the measures who those to facilitate the savings - studies for the children and has mentioned the scholarships of studies Canadian of the millennium who , according the government , improve to to more affordable the studies collégiales and academic . 
he has also mentioned the relief of the mechanism of would of the debts étudiantes and the improvement of the measures tax for promote the learning continuous . 
in fact , I believe that he has spoke of " strategy " in évoquant the together of these measures . 
the government said now that he the continue of the support on this strategy in conclusion several initiatives . 
the speech of the Throne was the great announcement that the government federal : 
... Brunswickers of the partnerships with the other governments , the agencies public and private and that with the Canadians and the Canadians , to of establish a plan of action national in the of skills and of learning for leXXIe century . 
this plan will the focus on the learning continuous , the tone to the problem of the low literacy home the adults and provide to the citizens the information which they have need for take of the decisions pressed in view of parfaire their skills . 
honourable senators , the speech of the Throne has statement three components of this plan of action , but I hope do that of other the there ajouteront soon . 
more specifically , the government has said that he told with his partners to of : 
d allow to the Canadians of fund more nervousness the learning continuous ; and 
d provide of the information to the the of the Canada on the markets of the work , the skills necessary and the opportunities of training to from of a consists unique , accessible by Internet , by telephone , or in human in all the communities of the country . 
honourable senators , all these measures can be very valid . 
a action in these three areas worry , who have been cernés he there has close of two years by the committee Senate Special on the education post , the is personally and is attendue since long . 
I wish also to congratulate the government of the be committed to improve the infrastructure of the know in creating of the instituts Canadian of research in health , in rolls the support to the advice granting and in encouraged the universities and the instituts of research of the Canada to nationally the cooperation international in the of research , same if the details are , I the said , enough obscurs . 
after all , the R - D is a other sector key that has mentioned the committee Senate Special of the education post . 
I I found with happy that , pursuant to several recommendations of our committee , the government seems recognize that he worth the only of draw of the researchers of Prime plan and of encourage our graduates to continue their career to the Canada rather that of the exiler . 
we must to the situation more most for that our graduates of studies post remain to the Canada to of ensure the advantage competitive that we we through to our with - of implement workforce . 
the the of the attention more great who is granted to the drain of the drain of the Canada , which the media speak many , this intervention is particularly timely . 
in a study that he has made recently , the Conference Board of the Canada has said that the drain of the drain , who is of more in more important , threat of vider the pool of workers qualified to the Canada . 
of more , the Prime leader of Newbridge , John Roth , has mentioned that his company will leave the Canada if nothing not is fact for Control the exit of capital human . 
by out that he rest to the Canada only 7 per of the does senior of Newbridge , he would said , according the daily Ottawa Citizen of the 12 November , this who following : 
, what good have a seat social to the Canada when the more great part of the team of the leaders of the company is part ? 
the the of the fact that 22 $ employees of Newbridge working to the Canada and that , each year , the company undertake the quarter of the engineers graduates trained to the Canada , . not can take that to the lightly . 
same Statistics Canada , that . has criticized for have minimized the importance of the drain of the drain , has admitted that the graduates Canadian who the pertinent to the south of the border are often the best , the more brilliant . 
same if several causes have been relevées for explain this migration tragic , he is clear that the system of education post to the Canada is a factor . 
I remind to the honourable senators that the Ottawa Citizen of the 12 November attribuait also Mr. Roth the note next : 
the quality of the diplômes in mention and in technology Achievement to the Canada is excellent , but I am that she not - to because of the funding inadéquat of the system of education . 
honourable senators , we must we ask if the measures that the Liberal than in the speech of the Throne backed , as the said the government , for establish " a strategy heartened to operating the advantage that represents for the Canada a with - of implement who is the more workforce to the world " . 
in fact , a time implementation in implement , this strategy sufficient she to maintain the quality of our with - of implement workforce ? 
I think that he must do many more in the sector of the education post for achieve the results that the government we has promised . 
I would favourite that the speech of the Throne we move a little of substance for enrober these words to the way who the want rassurants . 
I would still better liked that he there be question of some sectors of the education post that the government seems have completely overlooked , of the sectors who , to my notice , are a importance capital if we want advance on the plan of the know to the enter of the st century and not not any a backsliding or , with a little of opportunity , do simply of the on - place . 
in the wish of the comments made Mr. John Roth , of Newbridge , I want speak more particularly of the funding of the education post to the Canada . 
the committee which I am part has qualified of extremely priority the assistance that the government federal and the provinces overwhelmingly to the education post . 
the committee has also recommended that " the government federal , all in by to respect the skills provincial , renouvelle the firm commitment in the sector of the education post " . 
the under - funding of the universities and colleges Canadian , result in part to the cuts to the Transfer Canadian in the of health and of programs social , has in , between other things , a increase of the costs of tuition , a deteriorating of the equipment and of the infrastructure physical and that a inability of draw the members of the body professoral the more qualified in the institutions post of a coast to the other . 
the costs of tuition high now including of to the education post inaccessible to of many students Canadian . 
the perspective of obtain the had and of be then criblé of high debts of studies that the scholarships of the millennium not now hardly of reduce many can , by example , be a part dissuasif crucial . 
the he is important of to of the loans and of other forms of assistance to the clause of the students , he must however limit the are that a student should have to borrowing . 
I me méfie of the promise that fact the government in the speech of the Throne of facilitate the funding of the education permanent . 
the he does simply help the students to borrowing more of money and to decrease their debt , I not believe not that this be the solution . 
this would to the hub before the boeufs . 
however , if the government the move of give more of scholarships or of enemies brought of debt , this promise me paraîtra more positive . 
the Canadians will impatients of see to the over of the two next years this that the government has to the fair to the spirit . 
in addition , we we extremely forward of see how the government and his partners will in so , as the for the speech of the Throne , that the skills of the skills suive the pace of the evolution of the economy . 
I hope do that that not the restrain not to cerner the professions , the crafts and the jobs in which . will need of graduates in the years to come , though that be a business important . 
this initiative should rather rest on of the measures concrete to to help the students to obtain the education and the training necessary for satisfy these needs . 
I the said , the Canadians will of close this that the government federal will to the over of the two next years to this regard . 
I believe that the Canadians not should not have to expect two years before that the government é the promises that he has made in the speech of the Throne regarding the education post . 
I remind to the government that he must act as now in this sector criticism . 
I remind also to the senators that this report of the committee is already old of two years and that he was none of the table . 
the senator Graham has been very provide in promises on the future of the education to the Canada . 
he is very eloquent . 
he there has two years , this are of the words of despair that the students , the bankers and the researchers we had Tongues on the of of the education to the Canada . 
this not was not a picture pleasant . 
he is therefore time that the government consider the education as a priority in the program for the new century . 
I must really congratulate the senator Graham for the comments that he has made today today . 
honourable senators , I could speak length of the education post and of the education permanent because this are that of the questions who me held to heart . 
I hope in have the opportunity in a it future . 
I will however to to the other aspects of the speech of the Throne that I want to , this is to say the Custody and the right of visit of the children . 
he is , all of first , of do a sure historic . 
I I had the honour of be member of the committee Joint Special on the Custody and the right of visit of the children , up in October 1997 . 
the government had created this committee to of duties a promise that he had made for the ensure that the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology , which I was chairman to the time , consider the new lines guidelines federal on the pension food for children . 
the 23 members of the committee , representative five parties , have therefore spent the year next to hear of the hundreds of witnesses and to study the serious questions regarding the families affected by a separation or a divorce . 
in December 1998 , the committee has tabled the report entitled : " Integrity the love of the children " . 
the report " a long series of recommendations to to recentrer on the child the system adversatif who there for the Custody and the right of visit of the children . 
the more important recommendation proposed of the changes grateful that the mother and the father were all two continue to play a role important in the life of their children . 
these recommendations were centrées on the concept of Custody shared , this who means the taken of decisions Joint and the agreement between the parents as to the sharing of the time and to the arrangements résidentiels . 
through to the Custody shared , the father and the mother two actively investment in the care to give to the children . 
in May 99 , the Minister federal of the Justice has released the response detailed of the government to the report of the committee . 
I I been pleased of learn that the government the about to support the major recommendations of the committee Requesting a approach to the right of the family rather centrée on the child in the case of separation and of divorce . 
we were all well fébriles , and same exaltés , the day where we we learned that the Minister would to in application our recommendations . 
... with his partners provincial and territorial , he the emploiera to reform the right of the family and to strengthen the plans of support to the families to that , in of the situations of separation or of divorce , priority be given to the needs and to the best interests of the children . 
this or shows clear that the government recognizes that the Custody of children and the access to those - this are a importance capital for well of the Canadians and that the concerns provisions to the system present not disparaîtront not . 
I hope that the government has the intention of speed his implementation in implement denies of the recommendations on the sharing of the task parentale contained in the report " Integrity the love of the children " . 
after all , the speech of the Throne every usually the priorities of the government for the session which he well of point of departure . 
the the of about recent that that of the election federal general will there of here 18 months , well before 2002 , the Canadians could the expect to of the progress more quick . 
I hope that this not are not of false hopes , but , the given the peerage performance of the government in this who respect the questions of Custody and of access , I I well afraid that they not be disappointed . 
however , . can always hope . 
between - time , of the hundreds of children not will not heard and ressentiront the pain of households brisés . 
honourable senators , I me am of have had the opportunity of speak on these two questions of the recent speech of the Throne , who in contains , well heard , many of other . 
of other senators have already very well underlined some aspects of the speech and of other the imiteront without doubt . 
in way of conclusion , I like express the hope that the government listen and that he will the of the concerns well hands and of the suggestions reasonable of my colleagues on of this side - this of the chamber . 
bill of bill on the Assent Royal 
second Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
- honourable senators , I must explain of first this that the this bill of bill not is not . 
contrary to the midst who have circulé recently in the media and , , he not for not the abolition of the ceremony of the Assent Royal such that we the know and who is observed here since 1867 . 
the bill of bill , addition that he preserves the ceremony traditional , pourvoit to a procedure different , to know a statement written , similar to the who is followed to the Kingdom - Kingdom and in of other country of the Commonwealth . 
the held of the ceremony traditional would required in the case of the Prime bill of bill of appropriation presented during of a session and to the least a time by year civil . 
the honourable senators who were attendance to the time the recall that a bill of bill to little close identical to the bill of bill S - 7 , the bill of bill S - 19 , had been presented to the Senate by the senator Murray , then Leader of the government , in July 1988 . 
the senator Doody had open the debate to the step of the second Reading few days more later . 
the debate had resumed in September but had been of short term because the priorities of the majority to the Senate were then , and not were not foreign to the disbanding of the Parliament the 1 October . 
the arguments advanced by the senator Doody he there has 11 years are still valid today today and a great part of my arguments are drawn of the unto . 
the last effort in this sense has been fact to the Senate to the over of the last session before of be , him also , victim of the prorogation . 
my remarks will therefore similar to those that I had made to the time . 
maintain the ceremony of the Assent Royal such that we the know and Authorize a statement written as cooperative is a about who has been raised to the Senate to of many occasions . 
in 1983 , the senator Frith has presented a inquiry regarding the desirability of be of the procedures of Alternative for the statement of the Assent Royal for the bills of bill . 
, the the of a recommendation made in March 1985 by the committee Special on the reform of the House of the Commons , the committee McGrath , as to the Adopted of a new procedure for the Assent Royal , the committee Standing of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure , chaired by the senator Molgat , has recommended of the changes from in the same sense . 
a Reading careful of the debate on the report presented by the senator Molgat the a support General for the idea , but a disagreement as to the manner of the to in application . 
. has found a solution in showing the bill of bill S - 19 mentioned more earlier , a bill of bill who is death to the Paper in reason of the prorogation least of three months more later . 
the bill of bill S - 7 , as the has fact the bill of bill S - 19 , resumed the principles of this report . 
the clause 5 of the Act of interpretation has that the Assent Royal foundation to the date of into in into of a bill , to the condition that no no other date not be set . 
well that the ceremony of the Assent Royal as such not be opinion in no text of bill , the thing of Beauchesne in give a descriptif . 
the Clerk Deputy of the Senate is responsible of the organization matérielle . 
the Canada is the only country to have sovereign this ceremony official who require the presence of the sovereign or of the Governor General or of their representative . 
the report McGrath be that " the Canada continues of do call to a practice using by the Parliament British in 1967 . 
in fact , no other country of the Commonwealth not the has remained . " 
, the Kingdom - Kingdom , the Assent Royal has required the presence of the monarque until in 1541 , when the Lords commissioners have been law of represent the sovereign . 
as we the know all , the Parliament the up of three entities , the Queen , the Senate and the House of the Commons , each the vital to the enacted of a bill of bill . 
our ceremony of the Assent Royal rassemble these entities for the last step of the process sometimes long who reciting the Adopted of a bill of bill . 
well that the Queen not refuses not the Assent , he must all of same the ask . 
a commentateur has wrote that the Assent Royal is always a formality necessary , but nothing of more that a formality . 
I am , all as of other , that this who should be a event important not be became a ceremony of routine who not raises that a low curiosity home those who the find to in be witnesses by accident . 
too often , the Governor General not can be present , and he is difficult and or of find a Governor General Acting to short notice . 
too often , the Acting must expect beyond - beyond of the time convenue , in reason of deliberations incidental of the Senate . 
the members attendance are usually least many that the Allison , particularly if the Assent is the after the adjournment of the House . 
a Assent Royal given later a Thursday after - afternoon means that little of senators will attendance . 
he " a climate of indifference , rather that of respect , to a ceremony who , well that she be in great part a formality , is however essential , and who we remind the evolution of the regime Parliamentary to the over of the centuries . 
some would that the Assent Royal is altogether and should all simply be been . 
I not me bothersome not in this debate today today , except for say that , in the legislation where the Assent Royal is exigée , people - the as she the deserves in subject to the ceremony with respect in reason of this that she means , rather that of the consider as a interruption inopportune of the business parliamentarians . 
not would - he not better of reduce the number of the ceremonies traditional to the over of a session ? 
in providing a procedure different , the Parliament approuverait , in fact , the importance of the ceremony traditional that represents the Assent Royal in in by a opportunity special , well denies and to which assisteraient several people , rather that a obligation which the repetition dilue the means . 
the Opposition to this bill of bill come of those who are that this not be that the pre of the end of the ceremonial such that we the know today today . 
the bill of bill S - 7 the yet the of these fears . 
the other procedure who is proposed is to allow a Assent Royal not traditional to the opportunity , when he is difficult for the these of the hear on a time who is to all , and and to ensure that he there that more that a senior of parliamentarians who there meetings . 
this problem become still more precinct when the House , in the framework of the delicacies of the wrote Parliamentary , precinct in the Block of the Western , and will followed by the Senate when she retournera in the Block of the Centre . 
of after me , he the is that of a reason enough for study carefully this bill of bill . 
honourable senators , I I taken be of not not present a argument long and detailed in favour of the bill of bill S - 7 , the of notice that these considerations of order General suffiraient to significant the interest . 
( on the motion of the senator Cools , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the communities francophones and acadiennes outside Quebec 
the deteriorating of the services in French - Inquiry - Adjourned of the debate 
the hon. Jean - Maurice Simard , to given notice the Wednesday 3 November 99 : 
honourable senators , such that heard between the two leaderships in this House , and I hope that all the senators will of agreed , I recognize the speak to my colleague , the senator Jean - Claude Rivest , for read my speech . 
my speech could excéder the time Allocation of ten minutes . 
the hon. Jean - Claude Rivest : 
honourable senators , I like of first say all the happy that I I of me associate to this speech , of a way a little unusual , in the framework of the procedure of this House . 
as the hon. senator Simard just of the indication , he me has asked of give Reading of the communication that he wanted do to the Senate to the opportunity of the Tabled of a report extremely government . 
I urge of , the together of the honourable senators to in take knowledge . 
this is really a reflection very thorough and very documentée of the share of the senator Simard on the condition of the communities francophones and acadiennes to the Canada . 
the the the chairman : 
honourable senators , the leave is - she granted ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Rivest : 
honourable senators , I me question to you today today for you speak of a issue who is enormous of importance for me and for the country . 
I want you speak of a question who me the to heart since always , a question of the more fundamental in which I I invested a great share of my action policy : the development and the francophone of the communities francophones and acadiennes of the Canada . 
, the term of a reflection personal of several months , particular of research and of consultation serious and depth , I you states that my concern as to the prospects of future of these communities are were if major that I can you speak of a emergency national . 
when I you about of emergency , when I say that she is of dispute national , I me based not only on the result of our research , but I puise also in this fashioned of knowledge and of experience that the . so in more of 30 years of life public . 
I me according to this instinct that we développons all for succeed to accomplish , to the better of our opportunities , this who is to the further " our off " . 
and all , in my be , me said that if we not do not all of the , with any the conviction and the energy which this Parliament , which this country , are capable , he will soon too later . 
we will , by refusal of act , by indifference , in the comfort of the paradigmes of our tours of ivoire political , failed the promise of a country who would could be if great , the he had only had the courage of the be . 
because that if , a day , were people these communities francophones and acadiennes , who have contributed to will a identity Canadian whose and respected across in the world , this will in great part because that the leaders of their country their will turned the walk . 
not is - this not the ultimate paradox ? 
we concerned of speak home we of this who raises the admiration , the respect and same the envy of any the world . 
we we afraid of remind to the Canadians that the proclaim fédératif who has seen emerging their country is a proclaim of a tolerance without precedent , between two Peoples voués to the principle of their equality step . 
, the enter of the year 2000 , we issue CPAs before these dinosaures idéologues who would we bring to a era least highest where the Canada of nine provinces on ten was committed résolument on the seaway of the anglicisation of his society and of all his members , francophones , aboriginal or newly upon . 
a policy who we has led all right to this Mr. é Laurendeau , of the Comission Royal of inquiry on the bilingualism and the Bilingualism , has called , he there has of that more of three decades , " the worse crisis of our history " , the of the Canada . 
in amount , if the . not about not of the crisis , this is that she not there not . 
if the . not admet not that the situation of the communities francophones and acadiennes of the Canada has reached a point criticism , . not sentira not the need of do what that this be for there which . 
if the . not fact nothing , . not can not the do criticism of have fact someone something . 
and all does for the better in the better of the mondes ... as in a conte of fées . 
but , honourable senators , . not the touch not that . 
the consigne is that if we we taisons , all the world must the nothing . 
this who to say that when the leaders of these communities osent rise the Senators and exposing the abuse which they are victims , . the chamber of the nothing . 
shirts ! 
. starts of first by feindre of ignore their existence . 
but a time the bad time of the support timides past , a time the interest of the media estompé , . remind quickly these fauteurs of unrest francophones to the order , in their by understand that the things of many better if the . not brasse not too the chaloupe . 
. the the francophones minority in hostages of the power . 
this government federal who should be their ultimate advocate , this government which responsibility the responsibility constitutional , legal and moral of do respect the rights of these minorities , the in the to the victims rather that to the guilty . 
not only refuses he of act , but the power federal the Strike that where they are the more vulnerable . 
. cutting their funding . 
and the leaders francophones , always proud , but of more in more hungrier , understand quickly this that they have to do the they want out of this Î . 
as . said : they rentrent in the among , they among submitted . 
. their ask that the things can very well , and many better , the do " in scenes " , that they avanceront more quickly as that . 
the more récalcitrants are écartés , . which for régner . 
I know that he there in has among you - and personally in the other House - who the offusqueront of such comments . 
you you empresserez of list the programs government to the support of the communities of languages official , and the milllions of $ who the there rattachent . 
you we parlerez of the success of this community , of the Year of the Francophonie proclaimed by this government , of the Summit of the Acadie to Moncton , of the Games of the Francophonie some in the year 2001 , here same , in the region of the capital national . 
. the vantera of have celebrated the tenth anniversary of the amendment to the Act on the languages official , who give to the government federal a responsibility increased to these minorities . 
I applaudirai and I you say : " Bravo ! " 
course that this are of talk and good initiatives . 
but I refuserai of go home me , imbu of the satisfaction of the duty work , as of other in this Parliament are tentés of the do . 
because our real duty rest still to do , because that of the their and of the games , he there in will always for already the populace . 
but no government not can never the glorifier of observe of this kind , when , in the tranchées , of the francophones of a bravery implacable continue of struggle against of the forces who at to the anéantir . 
you can we do all the more talk celebrations of the world , that not réussira never to smuggled the truth of a government who refuses of support these francophones , then that this is his responsibility constitutional of the do . 
same to the level school , the struggles not are not still finies . 
you not hearing not of congratulations of my share when I see the governments provincial the sustains of the désengagement of the federal to the minorities for the thoughts to of the délestages of responsibilities who taxation or stop the learning of the francophones . 
you not be never change the sad reality that , more of 30 years after the Adopted of the Act on the languages official , the equality of the opportunity , the equality of the Peoples , real or precipitancy , is far of be specifically . 
you not be never we do forget that , more of 30 years after that the Board Laurendeau - Dunton that recommended the positioned of the bilingualism official for the governments of the New - Brunswick , of the Ontario and of the Manitoba , a only of these provinces has agreed of the do . 
the more bigger , the more puissante , the province who live the half of all the francophones of the outside of the Quebec refuses still of recognize the rights of the minority franco - Ontario in the Constitution . 
the the the Speaker : 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Rivest : 
as to the Manitoba , he will was the Court Supreme for him do understand that she gouvernait since almost a century in the illégalité total , without be the incidents disgracieux of 1984 , where the hounding of some politicians provincial the déchaînait against the Francos - thinks . 
we should rougir of shame to think that to the time where I you about , a Franco - Ontarienne of the behalf of Gisèle Lalonde , with a small team , sillonne this great province in self , for gain of the support to the because of the enchâssement of the rights of the francophones of the Ontario in the Constitution . 
the Department Heritage Canadian him has given the money for the do , me direz - you ? 
I défie who that this be in this Parliament of accomplish this that Ms Lalonde is in seaway of succeed with a budget of 35 $ $ . 
and you requesting that . the this to genoux before that . 
you requesting that the Franco - Ontarians be éternellement grateful , when we their giving of the bouchées of their for do our work ! 
not would - this not to we of go thoughts the message of the community across to the Canada ? 
the amount of the grant granted by the Department of the Heritage Canadian to the movement Frontiers Constitution is so risible that . would tried of believe that . the has given in souhaitant that he échouerait . 
this was difficulty know the people of the trempe of those and of those who have chosen of to the beacon , to and against all . 
this grant not is - she not , however , matching poised of the " of the federal in the money granted to the communities of languages official ? 
where is past the principle of the équivalence , yet spent by the Court Supreme in the v. Mahé ? 
how can - . hope that the communities so the expand when they not can benefit of the programs of the state Canadian , as that in considerable the majority ? 
yet , wide their trajet of individual , the francophones of the Canada continue of the rise , as of the cerfs - volants , against the over , against all the kind . 
they have thought this government , when he their has said that they were of the citizens equal , of the citizens to share full , that the Canada was also the country of the francophones , that they there had fully their place . 
they the have so thought that this is this conviction his who continues of the to to the combat today today , in the hope that , earlier or later , their leaders the joindront to them , in real allies and not in false mécènes , for conclusion the implement that they have forgotten of complete . 
the time is come for we , in this Parliament , of add all our Senators , all our efforts , all our ways to those and those who , by the force of the given , are still and always to challenge the history . 
this people refuses of die . 
honourable senators , I you ask with of read the report that I I tabled more earlier today today . 
this is a work seriously , sincere , without claim and martyrdom of mired . 
I you ask of keep the spirit open in moved these lines , of keep your " and your coeurs open . 
some states , as some of the comments that I wish today today , not will not your happiness . 
we can however act . 
we must act . 
I you ask of reflect on this a , to the page 38 of the report , who the reads as following : 
he is surprising of see that , in despite of the coverage let , who is well more to an and to esteem the controversy that to rapporter the good new , the opinion public Canadian , as the note a analysis of the professor Stacy Churchill , is life strongly in favour of the political on the languages official to the over of the 25 to 30 last years . 
the analysis the has also led to the conclusion that the authorities government have miserably failed in their attempts in view of inform the Canadians of this support . 
this is the secret the better touch to the country . 
that is - this that that we said ? 
, my notice , that we said not only that the Canadians of language English to that the francophones have their place among them , with their institutions and their services public , but that the only presence of these communities minority to the within of their society fact also part of their own identity Canadian . 
being Canadian for them means , between other , accept that around of we , of other Canadians choose of live in the a or the other of the languages official . 
that means also that the Canadians understand the difference between the bilingualism individual and the duality linguistic . 
human not ask to anyone of learn and of speak the two languages official , though we can assume that in a world perfect , this would course the ideal . 
I you ask , honourable senators , of and this challenge who the there to the state Canadian . 
the unkind is today today favourable to a recognition puissante , résolue and irréversible of the community Canadian . 
the time is come of to to the actions , of declare and of an a will national in favour of the equality of the francophones and of the English of the Canada . 
former - Minister of the Finance of my province , I would the last to technique that we retournions to the folles Estimates who we have given the deficits of a past still too recent . 
but the government is currently in Position financial solutions for beginnings to invest in the construction of the system hospitals who will to these communities a opportunity equal of succeed . 
because this is a implement to conclusion that we we multitude to the abandonment . 
as to me , I believe that this Investment in our foreign French in is a who not would never should be reduced or freiné . 
of more in more , all the Canadians they the strengths of the bilingualism and of the federalism . 
they have seen of their " , to Moncton , recently , how a reputation of opening and of jurisdiction linguistic their newcomers of the doors we fermées on the world , particularly on the Europe , this superpuissance economic in become . 
they have heard the Speaker of the France boasting a Canada tolerant , rather that of people the francophones of the Quebec to the separation - this who was until - that the only remember that several of between them had of a such visitor . 
of more in more of Canadians of the majority , also , the concerned of the diminution cultural and linguistic of their fellow minority . 
they understand that a Canada without his communities francophones not is more the country which they are if proud . 
. has seen , in the because of the Hospital sought , by example , of the alliances inédites and inespérées between the community franco - Ontario and of the members of the community English of this province and of , to the Canada . 
that we - we for understand that the people we has exceeded ? 
that waiting the governments of this country and of the provinces for understand that the new generations not want more of war linguistic destructives , that he is time of to to other something , of build with confidence on the basis that we we jetées he there has 30 years ? 
memories - we only why , to the over of the tumultuous years 60 , the Board Laurendeau - Dunton spoke of the crisis the more serious of our history . 
this is that they had including that the country was to the on of the apartheid , that he was question of the actions stewardship , and quickly , if the . hoped see the Canada survive to the déchirements who the menaçaient . 
of more in more of these people of the Quebec who the were always identified as Canadians - Français s now the say Quebecers of first , if exclusively . 
the Quebecers not accept more of be minorisés to the Canada , they deviendraient dispelled home them . 
of the same way , they concédaient that they not would never their full place in this Canada where their fellow had or all the affronts , that where the education in French was still illégale . 
has . forgotten this who we has wishes to the situation that we greatest today today ? 
the first ministers provincial understand - they that this intolerance historic of their own governments is a of the sources of the séparatisme Quebec ? 
the government of Ottawa includes - he that beyond - beyond of all the savantes strategies , of the plans A , B or C against these nasty separatists , he would can - be begin by the pre ? 
how of sovereignists rêvent of a country all simply because that . not has never wanted their give the who their up , because that . has killed their dream Prime to minuses of political assimilatrices ? 
honourable senators , I not you ask not of to in back . 
however , I you ask of you remember , of thrust your wisdom and your reflection of prospects historic . 
the report that I you commend contains 42 recommendations , which 10 recommendations major who make the framework of the plan of recovery that we you propose for the communities francophones and acadiennes of the Canada . 
the task seems enormous , the challenge insurmontable , but he is to the legislation of the people of this country . 
he is to your legislation , to our legislation . 
this is a bill of society emballant , positive and generous . 
but without the courage of the do , all that , all this that we represent , all this a décor who we live not to nothing say . 
when the walls of the Parliament are their those of the silence , of the silence on the fate of the more vulnerable , we we lost our reason of be . 
I I confidence that you me écouterez .

almost all the provinces have now adopted a program of suspension similar being to the semiconductors in of of highest , and good number of between they have succeeded to reduce of way substantial the number of accidents . 
in quality of legislators federal , we can from many of lessons of the experience of our Provincial provincial who have clearly learned the each of the other . 
the Senate is constantly in butte to of the attacks and dépeint by of many people as the a institution who , according the majority of the Canadians , is needless .

honourable senators , responding in 3.2 Mr. Hoy and to the rest of the Canada to what point the work that we how here is important .

I wish for the moment to congratulate the Department of the Affairs foreign and of the Trade international for the assistance that he has made to Kenex in view of deal this case to the advantage of this business young and dynamic . 
my congratulations to Kenex . 
this is a good new for the farmers Canadian . 
the year international of the people seniors 
the hon. LoisM. Wilson : 
honourable senators , the Year international of the people seniors décrétée by the Nations Nations is to his end but , the the of the population of the people , the reason of be of this initiative remains full to the " of the senators . 
he must also give a more great attention to the inégalités in the of care of health and of well - be that the . be home the people seniors to low income , the people seniors living only and the one women to of the problems of health accessibility and without home fixed . 
the fourth Conference World Annual of the Federation international on the population , who has had place to Montreal in September 99 , has been a statement . 
the document the concern of this that the principles that the Nations Nations have adopted in 1991 in favour of the people seniors not are not still recognized or respected resource and that the implementation in implement of the plan international of action on the population adopted to Vienne in 1982 it still to wanting . 
is this that the committee of the rights of the man of the Nations Nations said in November 1998 to comments of the record of the Canada in the application of the Convention of the Nations Nations Current to the rights economic and social : 
... that the Canada submit a below of poverty official and this in place to all the levels a program of assistance social who guarantee a quality of life reasonable for all . 
during of the meeting who the is held to New York , the country third - mondistes have indicated that only 8,5p. per of their effect respective vivraient until to 60 years . 
in Africa , this per not is that of 3 per , while that she is de24p. per for the Europe . 
he responsibility to those who , as we , wish the changeover of a world new of examine of very close the situation of these continents of the poverty and the of the îlots of poverty who exist to the within of the people ageing of the Canada . 
the question of the poverty of the people seniors must be analysée in the context of the development , of the Elimination of the poverty and of the exclusion social soulignés to the Summit world of Copenhagen for the development social , the in 1995 . 
after several years of decline , our program of assistance addition - sea is of the least stabilized , but he mériterait of benefit of appropriation supplementary . 
he mériterait also of coordinating the action with the of the program of allègement of the burden of the debt of the majority of the country debt and with the initiatives to to promote the employment and the health for the people seniors . 
the Nations Nations have been invitées to organizing in five years a conference World on the population , to the over of which will been in magazine the progress made by the different States for the implementation in implement of their plan of action in favour of the people seniors . 
I am sure that the bill will avalisé and that the point that will then the Canada on the situation of his people seniors démunies , vulnerable and without homeless will positive .

question PERIOD PERIOD 
the resources natural 
the closure of the Corporation of development of the Cape - Cape - - announcement of the injected of funds - - Position of the government 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
Monday , the Minister of the Resources natural , Ralph Goodale , has announced that the government federal injectera 70 million of $ in the Corporation of development of the Cape - Cape to of keep the society of state in activity until in April 2000 . 
he the is of a Doctoral full of the share of a government who has supported again time that he not there had not of new funds federal available for improve the pension of retirement and the allowance of cessation of employment educational to the amends of the Devco and their families . 
the employees of the Devco the are sought during more of eight months for that the government improving the agreement . 
the government Liberal has provided 111 million of $ to the for of the pension of retirement and of the allowance of cessation of employment , but 340 amends only will right to the benefits of retirement and 650,000 to the allowance . 
this assistance financial federal to the society houillère for a second year of back is a Doctoral unmitigated . 
how the government ask he that he can provide suddenly of the million of $ that he claim not not have to of keep in activity the society that he has the intention of close ? 
that means he that the government not has not forsaken the Cape - Cape and that he will of the funds Commission to the amends of the Devco who were complete the first year of the new millennium without employment ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I then saying categorically and without fear of be contradicted that the government of the Canada not has not forsaken the Cape - Cape in the past and not has not the intention of the do to the future . 
our commitment to the Cape - Cape the is sue . 
and , all recently , the government federal , of together with the province , has the on at a funds Special of development of 80 million of $ to of help the economy of the Cape - Cape to extension this period of transition very painful . 
the government of the Canada continue of play the role for come in assistance to the people of the Cape - Cape . 
in this who respect the 70 million of $ , the closure of the Devco in as that society of state was have place of a manner very phased and very coordinated , to the end of December 99 . I am course that the senator is to the aware of the very detailed program relatif to the resources human who has been public and presented in report with this calendar . 
the government had présumé that , for offer this program , he could be on some revenues from of the production of the mine Phalen . 
this part of the plan was very important and greatly necessary . 
the senator and of other senators know that the mine has been closed more earlier that provided , in of the circumstances surviving . 
the mine has therefore been closed immediately , primarily for of the reasons of security . 
, because of this closure immediate , the revenues who him would for of continue his activities until extending December the are envolées . 
two choice the overemphasized to the government . 
the Prime was to to of the revenues for that he can respect the commitments that he had taken to the amends and their families in the framework of this program . 
I know that the senator not approuverait not a such solution . 
of , , of many groups of the Nova - Nova , there including of the members of the party , have said that this solution not was not acceptable . 
by therefore , the funds have been some for ensure the withdrawal graduel of the government federal in the and of the mines . 
and , the people who were forced of amend their way of life in service of this plan not deemed not their life suddenly bouleversée . 
we are convinced that all the déroulera as provided and that the Alternative of the revenues from of the mining of coal is the solution the more viable . 
the Corporation of development of the Cape - Cape - - bill of bill to disbanding - - consequences for the amends and the staff 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , the bill of bill C - 11 , who allows the sales of the Devco , contains a clause who is to remove a clause of the Act on the Corporation of development of the Cape - Cape according which the government must take all the precautions reasonable for ensure the well - be of the workers . 
if this bill of bill is adopted , the government Liberal will he all simply close the doors of the society , back to the amends a payment unique universities to least of a year of activity economic générée by the Devco , and the in issue the hands ? 
in the case contrary , what initiatives federal will implemented in implement for create of new jobs and for promote a new growth in the economy affaiblie of the Cape - Cape ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , of very major initiatives are in seaway of enforcement , which some that I I mentioned briefly . 
in the of development economic , a statute of 80 million of $ who the add to the programs existing , this is a effort appréciable . 
of same , the assistance granted to the amends and to the people of the Cape - Cape is important . 
the Prime Minister the is yet committed to bye this assistance and . the fact now . 
frankly , I not me am not of included for the électricien of the Devco who receive a allowance of layoff of 80 $ or 90 $ $ and who décrochera a other employment six months more later . 
this worker the tirera very well of case . 
I me concern however of the who , to because of many years of work and can - be of a inability by , will of the difficulty to the least in the new economy . 
as I the I said , . revoit this allowance and . attempts of determine if of other measures could be taken , in particular to of help the workers who in have the more need . 
the senator Oliver : 
the Minister not has not fact referring to the clause of the bill of bill C - 11 that was my question Supplementary . 
the senator Boudreau : 
except mistake , I me am committed yesterday to back this notice to the senator Murray .

the hon. Gerald J . Comeau : 
honourable senators , the hon. Leader of the government to the Senate the recall that in 1993 - 1994 , the government federal has closed the army Cornwallis . 
, the time , . has déménagé the leaded of the chapelleSt. George' s to the outside of the basic . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate can - he we say when the Department of the Defence national the least these leaded in the chapelleSt. George' s ? 
the people who have paid for these leaded , residents of the place and ancient recruits of the basic , want that these leaded be replacés that where they were . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I know the matter which the senator about . 
these leaded have been they of a chapelle who was unused . 
they the find now to Halifax , who is the more great basic Pubnico to the country and which the chapelle receives of the issue all the days . 
. has decided to a sure time of the dramatically in this chapelle for that the people so the see and the s more regularly . 
I believe understand that the chapelle of where they people is of new met , but of way rather sporadique , a or two time by year . 
. has decided , for the moment of the least , that these leaded should stay in a place where they can be were and off by more of people . 
of the representations have been Conducted recently and . the before course on the question , but this is that this who has been decided for the moment . 
the senator Comeau : 
I I a question supplementary , honourable senators . 
the Leader of the government has said that the chapelle of Shannon Park , where the leaded are now , , well more often that the chapelle of Cornwallis . 
. could can - be compare the figures of fréquentation , as that the fact sometimes between the House of the Commons and the Senate , for see if indeed the chapelle of Shannon is more fréquentée that not the was the of army Cornwallis . 
however , this who is many more important that the fréquentation of the chapelle , this is the fact that the people who have offered these leaded live in the region of Cornwallis and of Digby and that of the thousands of recruits who are fellow by Cornwallis will the there on to the spring . 
I think that they would very like of see the leaded that where they should be historically and logical . 
I ask to the Leader of support this initiative . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the proposal of the hon. senator that I me undertake to whether the fréquentation of a to or of a service church me remind the précepte unto following : " That the who not has never sinful , challenges the first - " . 
I not believe not that I would very inclined to be the number of people including to a whatever service church . 
I understand however the sentiment that the senator just of express and I not certainly not of in do share to the Minister . 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I I me also a question supplementary . 
I could without doubt look the Prime caillou . 
if the Minister could know where the find the bancs of the chapelle and the he could see to this that they there be réinstallés , the chapelle would can - be a little more fréquentée . 
the senator Kinsella : 
where are - they ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I could without doubt speak more later to the hon. senator and find the bancs . 
the Alternative of the helicopters Sea King - - possible of the credit - lease 
the hon. Gerry Germain : 
honourable senators , my question the question also to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
she has relates to a question that I I raised the 4 November regarding the helicopters Sea King . 
I I mentioned to of larger occasions , all as the senator Forrestall and of other to the Senate , the emergency of deal this question . 
I am went until to say - and I the say if we had a government Conservative , NDP - advised or Reform - that if nothing not was fact and the he there had a accident , the responsibility in incomberait directly to the cabinet , to the Prime Minister and to the Minister of the Defence national . 
as number of other Canadians , I believe that we we forsaken our forces Armed for this who is of their provide a equipment course . 
the cancellation of the given of the EH - EH has been a decision policy and I not am not sure that they would in service today today if the given had been unabated . 
however , the Leader of the government has said that I would soon a response to my question of yesterday . 
could - he now me give a response more direct and clear ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , for this who is of the program of Alternative of the helicopters Sea King , in a sense , I can repeat this that I I already said to the Senate . 
I I spoke to the Minister of the Defence national , who me has said that he the is for him of the question the more high in the of equipment . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
this is this that the government said always . 
the senator Boudreau : 
the Minister has from a sure success . 
the government the is said prepared to Engage of the funds for of the programs important , as by example the of the under - submarines . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
how will the modernization ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
the Minister me has said that this question is extremely priority for him . 
I him I said , as I the attention now to the honourable senators , that I consider this question are priority . 
I opposite to Halifax and he not there has not a city in our country where the military are held in more high believe . 
we apprécions greatly the role that they play and the with that they are daily . 
I will certainly support as that I the can all the efforts been to that the acquisition of the aircraft of Alternative of the Sea King the the the more earlier possible . 
the St. Germain : 
honourable senators , I not doubt absolutely not of the intention of the government of who of the aircraft of Alternative . 
this is that the aspect key . 
I about to as of pilot to a experience active . 
the he must ensure 30 p.m. of maintenance for that a apparatus can steal a time , the honourable senators can the imagine the peerage of of the aircraft in question . 
anyone knows a little the helicopters knows to what point they are submitted to of important efforts and constraint . 
I say to the hon. Leader that to my notice , we not we of other choice that of who of the helicopters . 
we must give to our military of the equipment doing who their will of secourir of the people who decision of the aventurer in sea to on of a at - to the broad of the coasts of the Nova - Nova or , . 
I urge the Leader to do current the matter and I him ask of new a response to the about of the sublease . 
the senator Boudreau : 
I remind to all the honourable senators that the government has taken recently of the commitments important to the regard of the equipment of the forces Armed Canadian . 
I I spoke of the under - submarines . 
for the under - submarines , the are incurred are of 750 million of $ . 
the process of Alternative of the helicopters of research and search Labrador is in over , and the are incurred in this case are little higher to 800 million of $ . 
the government has also committed 30 million of $ for modernize the side Aldershot , and he has also committed 300 million of $ to the as of the benefits , for improve the level of life of the members of our forces Armed in this region . 
I not want not éluder the question of the hon. senator . 
in fact , I I fact of the research and I I a response regarding that I prévoyais table to the end of the period of the questions . 
I can confirm to the hon. senator that the . not for not , for the moment , who of helicopters . 
the St. Germain : 
honourable senators , he is all to fact unacceptable of airing our military to of such conditions in reason of the bad of of our equipment . 
he must find a solution . 
he me unpopular of duty say that , but I not so not to find of the words for describe the afraid that must certainly repeated the Pilots when they must do steal a apparatus who has need of 30 p.m. of maintenance for each time of flight . 
the hon. senator can - he think to a other organization in the world of the required who fonctionnerait in of such conditions ? 
the senator Meighen : 
she should close his doors . 
the St. Germain : 
the senator Meighen has reason . 
be the Board of the security of the transport , be the Department of the Minister Collenette the would close in reason of the peerage of of his aircraft . 
I urge a time of more the Leader to reparler to the Minister for that he change his Position . 
the senator Boudreau : 
I thank the hon. senator for his comments . 
honourable senators , I me said , but the Minister me has given the insurance that his first priority was the Alternative of the helicopters . 
of any obviously , he recognizes , as all those who ministries the situation , that the helicopters must be replaced . 
for this who is of the use of the aircraft , I me rassure to the idea that the helicopters not recevraient not of mission of flight if the people responsible not were not convaincues that they can the duties . 
as to the cost of the maintenance , some questions can the question . 
however , we we happen of that and I hope that the aircraft will replaced also quickly that that can expectation the do .

the Act on the stopped judicial 
bill of bill Amend - Second Reading 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Fraser , seconded by the hon. senator Gill , Honourable to the second Reading of the bill of bill C - 7 , Act amend the Act on the stopped judicial and a other bill in consequential . 
the hon. Pierre Claude Nolin : 
honourable senators , before of read the text that I I prepared , I want you remind that the bill of bill C - 7 is in substance and assessments the bill of bill C - 69 , which we had began the review to the end of the last session . 
my remarks this after - afternoon will several time do reference to the former bill of bill C - 69 . 
not there see not that a attempt of you deceiving in mistake , but the Bill bill C - 69 equivalent to the bill of bill C - 7 assessments . 
before of planned my speech , I wish to thank the hon. senator Fraser for have seconded the interventions that I I made in this House and that to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional for amend the ancêtre of the bill of bill C - 7 , be the bill of bill C - 69 , to the level of the powers regulatory similar to the Solicitor General . 
I wish also to out that the Solicitor General has was with happy the changes that I I proposed to this bill of bill in June last . 
I him in am very grateful . 
these provisions help to facilitate the réinsertion social of the offenders . 
of more , the Act Canadian on the rights of the human , any discrimination to the people who have from a preventative of the Solicitor General of the Canada . 
he is important of mention that the preventative not efface not the existence of the condemnation and that she can be automatically cancel if the human is certified condamnée for a act criminal . 
now the Act on the stopped judicial for the consequences of the granting of the preventative , as the implementation under scellés of the stopped judicial of the offender . 
honourable senators , the changes proposed by the government to the Act on the stopped judicial , by the through of the bill of bill C - 7 , improve to increase the security of the people . 
primarily , they are the to prevent the offenders sexual of with of the positions of confidence with of the children or of other people vulnerable . 
for achieve this objective , the bill of bill C - 7 move of add a clause Supplementary in this who has relates to the case particular of the stopped judicial of the offenders sexual réhabilités . 
the new clause 6.3 of the Act on the stopped judicial for that the Commissioner of the Mounted Royal of the Canada can include in the fichier automatisé of the relevés of condamnations criminal moreover by the RCMP , a indicateur or a marqueur who brief the service of police by a research to of the for of filtrage that he there , relatively to a human , a matter scellé or a reports of a condemnation for a offence to uniqueness body the to the regulations to the regard of which he him has been over a preventative . 
this recommendation has been unequivocally to the unanimously by the ministers federal and provincial of the Justice during of their meeting of October 1998 , to Regina . 
and , the agencies who may of the services to of the children and who want Engage a volunteer or a employee up will now determine if the candidate has from a preventative to the regard of a offence sexual . 
this audit not can be done that to two conditions : of a share , if the employment plaçait the postulant in situation of authority or of confidence by report to the children or to of other people vulnerable ; of other share , if the - this has contribute by wrote to the audit . 
the " marqueur " signalera to the police who fact the audit to of the for of filtrage that his ask of disclosure of the stopped of a human réhabilitée must be particular of the fingerprints photographed of the human in question . 
if the audit allows of establish that the human has already fact the subject of a condemnation for a offence to uniqueness body , the RCMP or the body officer in question who has by to the audit can ask to the Commissioner of the RCMP of back to the Solicitor General all matter or reports of condemnation to the regard of the individual . 
the Solicitor General can decide of the relevance of book the content of the stopped . 
if this last the allows , the RCMP or the service of police can to the information to the body who in has fact the ask . 
by against , the body not can use these information that in the framework of the review of the ask of employment . 
for avoid of the abuse , the bill of bill for that this audit not can be specifically to a other end that the of study a ask of employment . 
honourable senators , he me fact happy of you say that I am fully in agreed with the objectives and the principles who under - tend the bill of bill C - 7 . 
he is clear that the security of our children and of the people vulnerable of our society will better protégée by these new measures . 
by against , I wish to mention that several associations , as the Corporation Elizabeth Fry , the Criminal Lawyers' Association , have been of the reserves as to the policy on which the based the bill the of bill C - 7 . 
the key concern of these groups the based on the fact that this bill of bill could exploring the integrity of the system of preventative and the role in the psychiatric and the réintégration of the offenders . 
they would , including , that the Solicitor General not has not established of way satisfactorily that the bill current on the stopped judicial and the preventative not enough more for protect properly the society of the prédateurs sexual who have been réhabilités . 
of more , the Corporation John Howard and the Corporation Elizabeth Fry are that in allowing the access to the issues of preventative , . not give a false sentiment of security , in reléguant in the Shadows of other elements key of the selection of the staff for the positions of confidence by report to of the children or of the people vulnerable . 
honourable senators , during of the business of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional on the bill of bill C - 69 , we we examined this question very carefully . 
in this sense , I like to quickly the question of balance between the rights of the people réhabilitées by the Solicitor General of the Canada and those of the children or of the people vulnerable . 
same if , to the " of some , the provisions of this bill of bill seem back in because the principle of preventative social on which based the operating of our system of bombing Earl and of preventative , this bill in so however to a sure balance between the rights of the human who has been accusée , condamnée then libérée and those of the children that we must protect . 
honourable senators , he is obvious that when he the is of perpetrators of children or of people seniors , a only offence in is already a of too . 
the consequences are serious and we must do all this who is in our power , in as that parliamentarians , for avoid that of such events the occur . 
when I states that the bill of bill so to a sure balance between the rights of the two groups of individuals , I not trying not of minimize or of banaliser the problem , but I want the to in context . 
when we about of actions criminals , of the treatment of the criminals and of offer of the measures of fight effective and realistic against this kind of crimes , we must see the things in a context comparative . 
I can you saying , in as that lawyer , that he is always very difficult of , to the perfect balance between the rights of the people , who have demonstrated that they could lead a life normal , and the fact of avoid that the system of preventative not become a mechanism who masque the background of the people who now of present a danger for the children and of other people vulnerable . 
this is a problem thorny . 
in this sense , the government federal has agreed , with all the other authorities provincial and court during of a conference of the ministers of the Justice , of to in place a system of repérage of this kind . 
this is the consensus which are 50 all these ministers . 
this is a compromise , this is a proposal , who not will not to the so in a sense or in the other , but who is considered as the balanced and achievable . 
in response to the concerns legitimate expressed by some members of the committee and some associations who are that the bill of bill not compromette the objectives of preventative of the process of granting of a shirts , I out that the bill of bill not for that a only exception to the benefits some of the preventative . 
he for a system of repérage extremely ciblé in which are included of the measures of protection of the rights of the human réhabilitée . 
I like now to the question of the regulatory - who , be said in way , has been to the heart of the business of the committee of the Affairs legal - Current to the application of the provisions for allow the marquage of the stopped judicial . 
as you the know , this question me concern to the more senior point . 
now , the clause 8 of the bill of bill for amend the clause 9.1 of the Act on the stopped judicial for that this new clause on the marquage of the issues of people réhabilitées the to a comdamnation for a offence to uniqueness body be implemented properly . 
in under of the bill of bill C - 7 - therefore the bill of bill that we we before we , and this was also the case of the bill of bill C - 69 - the government can , by regulation , first , inventory the list of the offences simple by the term " to uniqueness body " ; second , govern the inclusion of the marqueur to the regard of the casiers court and relevés of condemnation and the audit of these the ; third , define the words " children " and " people vulnerable " ; and fourth , govern the process of consent of the individual Treaty to the new clause 6.3 , of the audit of the issues or of the communication of the information that the stopped contains to the body who in fact the ask and make in the regulation the factors that the Solicitor General the in consideration when he wants of Authorize or not the disclosure of the content of the matter of a human réhabilitée . 
during of the appearance of the Solicitor General before the members of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , the 14 June last , I I should that the powers regulatory , such that définis by the Bill bill C - 69 , were a question of policy . 
, this effect , I him I asked several questions . 
why the process of consent of the individual described to the new clause 6.3 of the audit of the issues or of the communication of the information that the stopped contains to the body who in fact the ask is - he done only to the Governor in board ? 
why the bill of bill not said - he not that he not the rallies only that to the individuals who had been were for a offence to uniqueness body ? 
same if all the speech of the government in the other House and to the Senate have always spoke of offence to uniqueness body , the bill of bill not was not reference specifically to the uniqueness body of these offences . 
why the bill of bill not contained - he not in Printed a list of the offences to uniqueness body same if of other législations federal , as the Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques , are a appendice who with clear the offences who are simple by the provisions of the bill ? 
honourable senators , when I I taken the speak in June last , during of the debate in second Reading of the bill Bill C - 69 , I I should that the powers similar to the Governor in board vigorously very important . 
during of the testimony of the Solicitor General to the committee , I him I mentioned that the . could deal these questions in the insérant in the bill of bill . 
medicare note honourable senators , that since few years , the government present - and the former government - attempts of exempt of several bills of bill the regarding legal or the process of operating of a legislation who could be filed or reticent when they are analyzed by the members of the Parliament , the committees Standing of the two Houses or the groups of interest . 
that is , you in agree , very disturbing because the process of consultation for the study of a bill of bill and the study of a new regulatory not is not of the all the same . 
in the case of the definition of the words " children " or " people vulnerable " , the officials of the Department of the Solicitor General have answered to our concerns of the way next : 
in the case of " people vulnerable " , the definition not had not been her in the bill of bill because she could change to the over of the next years . 
in this sense , he would therefore been difficult of define this term in the bill on the stopped judicial . 
in this context , he was more benefit that the ministers so amend this definition by regulation without have to present a new bill of bill . 
despite all , I I reminded to the Minister and to his officials that a part of the Code Civil of the Quebec with been and of way very specific of the people vulnerable for that their rights civilians be protected . 
in the case of the term " children " , the officials have should that this definition was already her in of other laws and that he not there had therefore no need of the include in the Bill bill C - 69 . 
yet , the new Act on the system of justice criminal for the adolescents that we taken to the over of the next months contains a definition of the term " children " . 
contrary to this that have should the Minister and his officials , I am am that this definition not finds not often . 
of more , these same officials have should for justify these two oublis that the Department has followed the same approach for the changes to the annexes to the Act on the system Correctional and the implementation in freedom under condition . 
now , these annexes are several regarding legal and regulatory who are need by ascertain . 
honourable senators , I wish to out that several members of the committee , which me - same , have fact out to the Minister that same if the clause 8 of the bill of bill C - 69 , who has relates to the power regulatory , said the fact that the offences tables for the drafting of the list would to uniqueness body , the bill of bill not was no says that he the rallies only to the individuals who had been were for a offence to uniqueness body . 
, several places in the bill of bill , . not was reference that to the term " offence " . 
by therefore , this list would could include a series of offences who not would not a uniqueness specifically body , this who would increased the scope of the provisions of the bill of bill C - 69 . 
that is too civil and too broad . 
the officials of the Department have should that this list there already . 
she has been indications in cooperation with the provinces for decide of this that he understandable of include on the list of the offences who must forecast of the offences of nature sexual to particularly of the children or of the groups vulnerable . 
if she is already indications , why not not the have her in the bill of bill ? 
that we would given the opportunity of the study immediately . 
in consequential , the list of offences who will to the basic of the application of this new legislation could be many too civil and she dépasserait widely the intention of the législateur . 
I wish to you remind that the right pénal is basic . 
a crime is a crime . 
in this sense , he seems little appropriate of let these decisions to the power executive , only to the power executive , rather that to the power legislative . 
of more , . not can renier the principle who to that all our laws be in agreed with the provisions of the Charter of the rights and freedoms . 
finally , in the case of the consent , the officials of the Department have influencing that they not had not felt necessary of include in the bill the process of consent of the individual provided to the clause 6.3 of the bill of bill . 
in several other laws federal , this process of consent is present specifically in the bill . 
honourable senators , for attempt of assure the members of the committee , the Minister has justified the inclusion in the bill of all these powers regulatory for of the reasons practices . 
in the spirit , some of these changes can take enormous of time , particularly the they were do the subject of in review Parliamentary thorough . 
in the case present , the government risk of the on in a situation that of other qualifieraient of high and that he not would not in legislation of go enough quickly if , by example , the definition of the words " children " or " people vulnerable " or the process of consent of the individual were be reticent quickly for of the reasons practices or legal . 
honourable senators , as I the I said , he is true that he is none of ensure to the protection of the children and of the people vulnerable against the prédateurs sexual . 
by against , that not is not a reason for repeal the powers of the Parliament and of to addition the principles of our Charter . 
this is for this reason that some members of the committee and me - same not we not agreed the explanation of the Minister , his argument and those of his officials . 
opposite to the magnitude of the criticism of the members of the committee - you know that this is a history who finit well - , the Solicitor General the is committed to reassess the provisions of the bill of bill to the over of the been . 
he me seemed more none of adopt the bill of bill quickly . 
the 9 September last , the officials of the Department of the Solicitor General have presented to the members of the committee of the amendments for correct the gaps of the bill of bill C - 69 . 
of more , the bill of bill spécifiera that the system of marquage of the casiers court not the adressera that to the individuals who have been were for of the offences to uniqueness body . 
for better encadrer this process , a list of offences has been added in Printed of the bill of bill . 
I there that you understand that I about of the bill of bill C - 69 . 
this last can be amended , by against , by ascertain . 
then , the regarding material " children " or of " people vulnerable " have been displaced , of the text of the regulation to the text of the bill of bill . 
honourable senators , let - me of conclude in stand that still a time , through to the resolute of the members of your committee of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , the bill of bill C - 69 and , I the hope well , the bill of bill C - 7 , have been greatly améliorés of way to this that the rights of the people réhabilitées and those of the children and of the people vulnerable be protected fairly . 
, the any end of my remarks , I support the principles of this bill of bill . 
he will examined as he the must to the committee of the Affairs legal and Constitutional . 
I hope that the government réintroduira the amendments that he had acceptance for amending the bill of bill C - 69 . 
we properly , still a time , very vigilant in your behalf , honourable senators .

the Code criminal - Act on the system Correctional and the implementation in freedom under condition 
bill of bill Amend - Second Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
- honourable senators , I rise the speak for propose that the bill of bill C - 247 be read a second time and for start the debate on this bill of bill . 
, the time current , the authors of whether many not can be were to of the , additional , not would - this that of a day or of a time for the second , the third or same the eleventh murder own that they caregiver . 
the bill of bill C - 247 served in question the concept according which the authors of whether many should be eligible to a bombing Earl after have purgé of 10 to 25 years of their only of diversion to perpétuité , what that be the number of whether that they have made . 
the bill of bill of Albina Guarnieri break this guarantee and will to the judges the possible of impose of the , proportionnelles to the crimes made . 
they will then the flexibility necessary for add a day or a year or until to 25 years of more to the only put . 
the only murderers who will opposite to this possible will those were for of the whether many . 
the bill of bill C - 247 was the C - 251 to the over of the last session . 
the Senate has received the bill of bill C - 251 the 8 June 99 during the the days of the session . 
in consequential , the bill of bill C - 251 has expired to the Paper . 
Le19 October , to the House of the Commons , Albina Guarnieri has presented the bill of bill C - 247 who was in fact the former bill of bill C - 251 . 
the bill of bill C - 247 has been read in first Reading to the Senate the 2 November . 
honourable senators , during four years the Commons have been saisies of this bill of bill under four clauses different , be the C - 274 , the C - 321 in 1996 , the C - 251 in 1997 and maintenantle C - 247 . 
that shows well the importance of the opinion of the House of the Commons for the cabinet and the Minister responsible . 
the bill of bill C - 247 is a bill of bill of initiative Parliamentary prepared , defended and sponsored to the House of the Commons by Albina Guarnieri , the MP Liberal of Mississauga - East , close of Toronto . 
this bill of bill does to a question social important and burning , the condition of the system of justice criminal to the Canada . 
Albina Guarnieri me has asked of sponsor the bill of bill here and of the defend to the Senate . 
I the wish in high believe . 
despite of many obstacles the deliberately in across of his road , she has fact current this bill of bill . 
all the Canadians him must many . 
I the support in his efforts , particularly in the task difficult who is to encaisser the minuses brutaux who are brought to the within of the own caucus , a area of the relations human which . should seriously reflect . 
honourable senators , the 18 August 1997 , to Surrey , in British - British , I I attended in company of Albina Guarnieri to the hearing , in under of the clause 745 , of the nation Clifford Olson . 
no arrangement not had been taken by the prosecutor General or the court for allow to of the members of follow this hearing . 
the members Liberal to the House of the Commons , Dan McTeague and Paul Steckle were also attendance , of same that John Nunziata , a former member Liberal today today independent , and several members of the Party Reform . 
Christie Blatchford has very well described this hearing . 
in the clause entitled : " Clifford Olson' s macabre circus' " , The the 19 August 1997 in the Toronto Sun , she said : 
the senator Liberal Anne Cools was so choquée that she was almost incohérente , saying between his you that the " cirque macabre " which . was in are of attend to the court was so monstrous that she was absolutely do someone something for the back , other she not could not the costs more long . 
honourable senators , the 1 December 1998 , in the testimony before the committee Standing of the justice and of the rights of the human of the House of the Commons to comments of the bill of bill C - 251 , today today the C - 247 , Albina Guarnieri has described the hearing in under of the clause 745 , Pritchard by the Justice Richard Low , of the Court Supreme of the British - British , in giving a view of the nation Olson . 
she has said : 
for me , the time the more alarmant in the trial Olson the is happened when Olson has read to high Senators a letter of the lawyer him conseillant of by of a only the all the whether that he had made . 
and , stated the lawyer , Olson could fully benefit of the system of , prosper . 
Olson has said that the lawyer him had fully of fully benefit of the system of , prosper . 
Albina Guarnieri on : 
Olson has nargué the court in their saying : " how not can nothing do . 
they not can that me give a only concurrente " . 
simply for you give a small idea of the other advice business of the member esteemed of the notaires representative Olson , Olson has quoted a letter of the lawyer who said : 
prepare a plan who contra of first to do in so that you are completely sufficient of the at of the share of policiers boy - scouts too zélés . 
the tax of , prosper is avantageuse for the authors nasty of whether many to the Prime and to the second degree . 
Albina Guarnieri we has invited outright to examine this disciples question of policy public , the determination of the only to the regard of criminals , and more particularly of the authors cruel , obstinés , incorrigibles and nasty of whether many to the Prime and to the second degree . 
he the is of the determination of the only for of the actions really bad . 
the " difficulty " is a word rarely used because that the employment require a definition of the " well " and of the source of the " well " . 
of more , these words , " well " and " difficulty " , do a debate moral , and a debate on the concept of a be transcendant , a déité , God as source of all this who is well . 
on the place public of our days , the development of the policy public and the debate on these questions are internationalist of convictions diplomacy , this who give this that of such . called the " place public any nue " . 
many of leaders political current have strove of from the policy of the moral and of from the for public of the convictions personal , in saying the do to the behalf of the neutral moral . 
the debate public and policy to the Parliament , on the place public , in the absence of principles and of convictions diplomacy , is a debate rhetoric and missed . 
the debate on the place public and to the Parliament require absolutely that the meeting do speak their convictions diplomacy and éthiques in the debate , and this debate must include of the justifications diplomacy . 
honourable senators , these the time , many have refused of admit the existence of the méchanceté human and that she has little of explanation and of théories . 
the very few explanation of the méchanceté who have been completed are of order Summa . 
however , the explanation théologiques are écartées of our days to the behalf of the neutral moral . 
however , those who working in the services of detention , in the services of police , in the sector of the any and of the right pénal , and in the services social - of same that in policy and in relations political - know that the méchanceté human there . 
she there really . 
they know also that the méchanceté human will of the difficulty to anyone the approach too of she . 
the difficulty has for nature and over of to they to the well , of him so and of the unnoticed . 
the Hope for Healing Zinn Evil . 
, comments of the difficulty , who effraie with reason the most of the people , the Dr Peck wrote to the page 42 : 
the fact that we not we not of definition generally accepted of the difficulty testimony of the enormous mystery of the about . 
I believe however that headwind , we we all a some understanding of his nature . 
this savant psychiatrist we informed that he not there not of definition generally accepted of the difficulty , and we about of the enormous mystery of the méchanceté human and the understanding deficit that we in we . 
the Dr. Peck wrote still , to the page 46 : 
that he suffice of admit that , well that we not horses not still of a bloc of knowledge scientific on the difficulty that he vaille the only of honour of the term " psychologie " , the experts of the behaviour have looked of the basis who their possible the development of a such psychologie . 
the child of the inconscient by Freud and the concept of the Shadows home addressed are all two fundamental . 
including our shortages in the knowledge of the difficulty , he has seconded the efforts of the Dr. Eric Fromm for the study . 
the Dr. Peck has added , to the page 47 : 
however , according my own experience , the people human who the livrent to the difficulty are very many and which usually very ordinary to the " of a observer not caring . 
the honourable senators the recall that good number of commentators had out that Paul raided and his woman , Karla Homolka , vigorously very normal and well ordinary . 
honourable senators , the Clifford Olson and Karla Homolka not are not patients , or mentalement or physiquement . 
they are all simply nasty . 
all common that he must be méchant for those the life of blood - cold , intentionnellement , deliberately , and of way person . 
he must be méchant for assassiner crudely , deliberately and of blood - cold several people human , am of the children vulnerable and without Defence , to of satisfy of the impulsions them débridées , of the perversions them and of obtain a gratification sexual . 
a such difficulty intestine to the treatment or to the remedies . 
in addition , the concept current of illness accessibility not uniting not to explain the difficulty and to the Control , because these Offenders not are not patients . 
the word " illness " means difficulty to the comfortable . 
far of the to difficulty to the comfortable , their behaviour not the gêne no . 
the nation Olson is all to fact to the comfortable with his condition . 
he sign his letters " Clifford Robert Olson , TUEUR EN SÉRIE of 11 children " . 
I I received a of his letters that he had signed of this way . 
the 23 April 1996 , to the Senate , I I raised the question of privilege , to the words of the ) 43 ( 1 ) of the Rules , to comments of this letter . 
the Speaker of the Senate has felt that he not there had not they to the privilege to first view . 
the nation Olson not is not patient , he is méchant . 
he appear that the ministers and their services respective not grab not of generates to this that the Parliament be excluded of the process of development of the policy Current to this question crucial . 
that me has The of as more clear when the review of my two bills of bill , regarding the détenueKarla Homolka and the agreements steely on the leaders of charge , has been interrompu sommairement and that the Statutory have been retirés of the Paper . 
in 1997 , I I resumed this initiative in the bill of bill S - 16 , Act regarding a some Karla Homolka , and that still , the Speaker in has ordered the withdrawal . 
in the second case , in 1996 , to the about of the bill of bill S - 3 , Act amend the Code criminal ( agreed on the Leader of charge ) , the study of my bill of bill has been inquire without that the committee that had enough of time , to my notice , for the in imprégner , without that a debate that been the , and without that that been heard the less witness . 
the only witnesses received by the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional for the bill of bill S - 3 , in extra of my own human , have been the representatives of the Department of the Justice , Mr. Yvan Roy Mr. quotes Bobiasz , lawyer you to the 110 of the policy and of the amendment of the right in the criminal . 
these witnesses have essentially asked to the committee of reject the initiative . 
my opposed not have wanted or of a debate or of a review . 
they would could amend the bill of bill or same reject my legislation Parliamentary after a review thorough and a debate articulate . 
honourable senators , during of the hearing demandée by Olson in under of the clause 745 and who has had place to Surrey , in British - British , I I learned that this mêmeM. Yvan Roy , of the Department of the Justice , was on place , to the clause of the media . 
Christie Blatchford , that I I already citée , has noticed the presence of these officials to Surrey . 
she in about in these words : 
... the officials of the Justice were that for give of the information on this clause controversial . 
she with these officials as the Irène Arsenault , manager , on with the media , Division of the Affairs public of the Department of the Justice ; Fraser Simons , steering regional of the Board of the libérations conditional , region of Abbotsford ; and , for repeating the term used by Blatchford , " the cerveau " , Yvan Roy . 
. the recall that the people who have rigorous the pleas of Homolka were George Dr. , under - prosecutor General of the Ontario , and the under - prosecutor Deputy , Michael Code . 
I rise note that , then that the Senate was before of my bills of bill to the about of Homolka , this mêmeGeorge Dr. is became under - Minister of the Justice to Ottawa , of the time where Allan Rock in was the Minister , lone of this fact the boss Mr. Roy , " the cerveau " . 
honourable senators , to the Canada , . not to not know this that think the parliamentarians of the Administration of the justice criminal , in particular in this who respect the determination of the only and the retribution . 
the bill of bill C - 247 is the expression of a opinion Parliamentary not deal who has been agreed to the House of the Commons by a vote majority , same if the Minister of the Justice not was not of agreed . 
of any obviously , the opinion of the Minister not was not the of the majority of the members . 
the observers looking our business for know if the opinion of the Minister of the Justice prévaudra now to the Senate . 
Albina Guarnieri has raised a question important in right pénal , be the of the determination of the only and of the retribution in the case of murderers dangerous . 
his real question the on the value , the value real , of the life of a be human by report to the sentence put to the who has ability a or several lives . 
appearing the 1 December 1998 before the committee Standing of the justice and of the rights of the human of the House of the common , Albina Guarnieri has said this who following : 
the Canadians not have never voted for the , prosper . 
. not their has never asked if their identity , their identity Canadian , was service of a system of determination of the only more laxiste , between other to the regard of the violeurs and of the murderers . 
the , prosper will to the any of the concept fundamental of justice . 
the fact is that the Canadians feel that each murder or sexual sexual , each victim , must be comptabilisé in the calculating of the only . 
in communiquant to the committee the results of a poll that she had she - same ordered , and who had been led by the sondeur POLLARA of the Party Liberal , she has added : 
this is why 90 per of the Canadians are supporters of amend the bill for the ensure that the people scant guilty of several whether or abuse them purgent of the , consecutive for each offence . 
this is this that has indicated a poll national made by POLLARA the months last . 
this poll has also for of see that to only 8 per of the Canadians are supportive to the quo quo . 
. see clear our condition Parliamentary and policy when of the members representative the people must have point to the surveys rather that to a debate one for convince the with political of the opinion public . 
Albina Guarnieri retirements and the explanation of the bill of bill : 
if , by the through of the tax of , prosper , . not the no the of the other victims who looking the first victim of a violeur or of a meurtrier , this principle is bafoué . 
the subject of my bill of bill is of from that each offence to the bill that a consequential . 
of the periods consecutive of not - Eligibility to the bombing Earl in the case of whether many to the Prime and to the second degree and a only consécutive for each act of sexual sexual favoriseraient a justice proportional who 1 more to the system fair and balanced that Plea the Canadians . 
honourable senators , the bill of bill C - 247 not fact that add a part legal of more to this that the government has already recorded to the clause 745 of the Code criminal , same such that amended in 1996 by the bill of bill C - 45 , Act amend the Code criminal ( review judicial of the inadmissibilité to the bombing Earl ) . 
as we the know , the diversion to perpétuité is the only minimum for the whether to the Prime and to the second degree . 
this is the compromise policy that . has fact in 1976 for obtain the abolition of the only capital . 
this only minimum was therefore agreed and parent of a period fixed of diversion before that the criminal that the right of ask a bombing Earl . 
in the case of a murder to the Prime degree , the date of Eligibility to the bombing Earl survenait after 25 years more of diversion and , in the case of a murder to the second degree , after a period of diversion of 10 years . 
honourable senators , he so frequently in the public that the . confonde the only of diversion to perpétuité for murder to the Prime degree and the 25 years who are indeed purgées before that the offender not be eligible to the bombing Earl . 
the only of diversion to perpétuité duration until to the end of the life of the offender , as the words the say . 
the term of the mandate is the of the life of the offender . 
the date of expire of the mandate is the of the Late of the nation . 
the Service Correctional of the Canada about of " date of expire of the mandate " . 
the only duration any the life . 
he " a great confusion to this about . 
well of the people think that the diversion to life has a term of 25 years . 
the regime of bombing Earl is a form of clémence Royal who allows to the nation of continue to purger his only in the community , outside of the walls of a other . 
a other form of clémence Royal is the hubbing of the only of death in only of diversion to perpétuité . 
this is this who has been provided in the bill for give the to the compromise policy of 1976 to to abolish the only capital . 
however , this compromise is now attack by the evolution of the process of determination of the only , who compromet the justice she - same . 
in 1996 , the bill of bill C - 45 presented by the government modifiait the clause 745 for prevent the authors of whether many of ask a review judicial of their date of Eligibility to the bombing Earl . 
in by that , the government has agreed a great part of the reaching of Albina Guarnieri , annoying that the authors of whether many were purger a only more long before of be eligible to the bombing Earl . 
honourable senators , I I already the in doubt the existence same of the clause 745 and proposed that he be failing to because of his gaps evident in the bill of bill S - 6 , Act amend the Code criminal ( deadline pre to the bombing Earl ) , that I I presented in 1996 . 
, the about of the bill of bill C - 45 , I I should that this was a amendment to a clause already token . 
during the debate of the 12 December 1996 , I I said : : 
honourable senators , in 1976 , the clause 745 of the Code criminal has " to the courts of the powers inhabituels their allowing of amend the decisions of courts senior - of the powers who are normally although to the over of call , to the authorities net of the power of clémence or to the Governor General . 
he has " to the courts of the powers inhabituels their allowing of amend the , déterminées by the courts law of to of the decisions . 
this is someone something who is should to the over of call and to the authorities net of the power of clémence . 
the clause 745 has had the effect very came of give to the courts the power of give the clémence . 
this power is of full right to some agencies precise . 
the bill of bill C - 45 treated these powers to the judges in Leader , this who fall the powers of the Parliament of give the to the best of the people . 
by against , the powers of the judges in Leader will increased . 
as we the know , according the Constitution , these powers not have not been opinions to the judges in Leader or to the courts because that this are of the powers political . 
this are of the powers Act by the representatives of the society . 
he not is not that the power of clémence of Majesty Majesty be has by the courts or the judges ; he must the be by the executive . 
he the is that of a power executive . 
honourable senators , the bill of bill of Albina Guarnieri on the , consecutive based on the grounds érigés by the government to the clause 745 who allows the judges to determine the term of the time of when . 
in the case of the authors of whether many who are patently malins , the bill of bill C - 247 specific that , when the contrevenant is recognized found of other whether , the judges can extend the period during which the contrevenant is for to the bombing Earl in him ordonnant of purger a time of when Supplementary who not can however not overtake 25 years . 
other said , the time of when not can overtake 50 years . 
the clause 745 is a solution policy agreed in 1976 for respect a compromise reached in 1976 . 
we we need of new solutions and the absence of new solutions in the case of psychopathies virulentes not will that undermine the confidence of the people in the system and that strengthen the claims of the Canadians who wish the recovery of the only of death . 
the bill of bill C - 247 is a compromise of the year 2000 , who result of the practices offered , of the gaps of the clause 745 and of the , generally cut to the Offenders patently malins . 
honourable senators , in the case of psychopathies and of psychopathologies Mudslide , the reality , this is that the psychopathes and the sociopathes are more sournois , more rusés and more ingénieux that the authorities . 
the held Olson and Homolka we in limited of the examples frappants . 
the fact that the prisonnière Homolka can continue the government before the courts example to said my comments . 
honourable senators , he is essential of put to the review of the Parliament our system of justice criminal , his mechanisms of any , the transactions in the criminal , the guideline of determination of the only and of bombing Earl . 
during of the hearing that the nation Olson has demandée in under of the clause 745 , I I been witness of this broader overhauled that is our system of justice . 
the Justice who chaired the hearing chaired a hearing policy . 
this hearing was is and well policy , she not had not a uniqueness legal . 
the Justice , the jury and all the world present in this Room the knew . 
we meetings greatly or to the independence of the judges and of the power judicial in positively the judges of this manner . 
I am some that the majority of the Canadians could imagine without suffice the nation Olson éviscéré , écartelé , the to the blanketed and décapité , because the crimes that he has made were and are still extremely répugnants for the people human that we are , but we not believe not to the only capital . 
is why we we this debate today today . 
the nation Olson has cost to our country of the billion of $ with his many fantaisies court , his the in justice and his prétendues are legal , there including the hearing that he has demandée in under of the clause 745 . 
all this that his notoriété has had of good , this is that she has for of the keep incarcéré . 
I then you say that human not the libérera . 
Karla Homolka is the equivalent the more natural . 
honourable senators , I I fact part of the Board national of the libérations conditional . 
I I examined well of the issues , of the reports of autopsie , of the reports of police , of the judgments and of the statements of Justice to the time of the determination of the only . 
I I status of many held and authorized or suspended well of the libérations conditional . 
I I learned that he is very rare of find home the Offenders a pulsion meurtrière who is parent of are prédateurs and who the country by their politics for the artifice , but that this is however more fréquent that . the think or that . to well the admit . 
the ability of these prédateurs of choose their victims in exploitant their vulnérabilité is diabolique . 
. about little in the two Houses of the Parliament of the case of paraphilie and of psychopathy , of the psychopathes , of the sociopathes and of the unrest of behaviour . 
he must discuss of the unrest of pulsions Mudslide érotiques of the Homolka and of the Olson and of their consequences on the system of justice . 
the most of between we not can understand their lack of compassion human , their deploy orchestrées , their désirs sexual déséquilibrés , their abuse , their narcissisme absolute and their profligate dépravées . 
he must that we considering their ability of manipulate with success the people and the systems , including the systems democratic , and their ability to visa on the incrédulité and the naive of the people . 
Three Essays . the Theory of Sexuality and Johansson Works , volume 7 , the Dr. Sigmund Freud has wrote on the unrest from to the pulsions them . 
, the page 111 of the edition of 1979 of the home Penguin , he ask : : 
the absence of the roadblocks of the pitié the Adieu of the risk that the link between the are cruel and the are érogènes and established in the boyhood the which impossible to parent to the age adulthood . 
we about here of déviants sexual evil . 
he the is of punishing of the crimes attracted by of the pulsions érogènes occupation , incorrigibles and Mudslide . 
honourable senators , the year of the power sovereign in the retribution of a crime is a of the aspects essential of the Administration of the justice . 
. can read : to the page 48 : 
the right of punishing is therefore a aspect of the right of the sovereign of do the War to his as ; the right of punishing provincial of the " right absolute of life and of death that the right Roman Order merum imperium , right in under which the Cardinal that to this that his bill be respected in ordonnant that the crimes be her ... 
but the retribution is also a way of obtain justice to the plan as staff that public , since the force physico - policy of the sovereign is , in a sense in the bill ... " 
I say well " obtain justice " , honourable senators . 
in our system , . about of prerogative Royal in justice . 
the presence of the Queen in the bill , that which a expression as the Queen against Homolka , proves clear the right of each citizen of obtain that the Queen , the source of the justice , their the justice . 
she proves the right of obtain justice of the accusateur , be the Queen , and of the victims , in this case - this the small Question Mahaffy and Kristen French , who not were that of the children . 
the retribution of the crimes and the , cut sending on the principles that are the vectors , the neutralisation , the psychiatric and the retribution . 
the retribution , to the difference of the vengeance , is the consequential fair of the they by the offender to the peace of the Queen and to the issues of the Queen , be , in the case who we ' , all the children . 
the retribution can always be tempéré by the clémence of the Queen . 
the Justice MacKeigan , of the Court of call of the Nova - Nova , , a pleas of the more solid in favour of the tax of , consecutive . 
, the page 443 of the judgment of 1975 in the case R . . Muise , he wrote : 
this principle , which I embrace in despite of the argument very statement of the lawyer of Muise , result of my own conviction who to that the bill , in commission to the Justice the power of condemn a human appropriately found of a offence to a only of diversion , even in the they to the do , not should not be interpretation as the the obligation made to the Justice of to a only of diversion for a second offence concomitante with the only put by him or a other Justice for a other offence . 
in infligeant a only refer concurrente to a offender , . not the punit not of the all because that he not is not the of purger a only day of diversion ; none not can to the same day in other two time , not more that he not can be Ere two time . 
in infligeant a only concurrente , a Justice not fulfilling therefore not the duty , to least of power find , in the Code or the right pénal in General , the power of the do . 
I please all the honourable senators of give to the bill of bill C - 247 any the attention deal . 
I want that the . understands well that he is here question of killers in series evil . 
he not the is not of poor young men who , under the the of a accrochage with their parents who the the in allow , the people CANBAT to a flight to with they . 
he not is not here question of the offender youth by . 
this are of the people who decision very froidement of killing someone a and who the are of full grateful with préméditation and Trapping . 
he is clearly time that the system and that the Senate recognize that the psychopathy there . 
the hon. Sheila Finestone : 
honourable senators , I wishes question a question to the about of this Presented indications with be and regarding a bill of bill very contentious and difficult . 
he not appropriate not that I say in this context that the senator Cools would could act in solo , she would could the do , but I wish indeed to say that this is a question very difficult . 
the senator Cools is a human who knows very well this area . 
the senator Cools : 
I thank the hon. senator of his question . 
this is the dilemma that there the clause 745 of the Code criminal of the Canada . 
as that I far , the majority of the senators are of the abolitionnistes convinced who not wish absolutely not that the . réinstaure a day the only capital . 
, the time of the Adopted of the clause 745 , he not had not been provided that each meurtrier recognized found of murder to the Prime degree the prévaudrait of this clause . 
in reality , . in is come to point this clause of way very routinière , and this is that that ahead the problem . 
the situation to this about is very clear . 
in the Bill bill C - 45 , the government Mr. Rock , the Minister of the Justice of the time , have made of the changes , clause 745 in view of draw some line . 
the Bill bill C - 247 refers that all these changes have been inadequate and that of other measures the do . 
I know that many of senators want speak in the debate on the bill of bill . 
in my conclusion to the debate of second Reading , I I the intention of present the historic of the sanctions and of the libérations conditional . 
I will to the Senate a statement on the evolution of the jurisprudence to the over des20 last years and I initiate how she has led to the situation current in the determination of the only . 
the hon. senator Finestone has struck in full in the in . 
the about require that the . the in ' . 
I hope that some questions surgiront to the over of the debate . 
why the judges not do - they not of the , consecutive , as they the can ? 
the senator Finestone : 
this is a case very came . 
the senator Cools : 
I say that all the whether are inhabituels . 
if the argument of the exception examined , we not have not need of laws against the murder because that the whether are inhabituels . 
the they not the were not , the resources human not thing more . 
this is very true . 
I I a amount impressive of documents on this kind of individuals . 
this who not is not if came home the murderers , this are the chronic . 
the récidive not is not unusual among this category of individuals that we lifelong the murderers many . 
some people , there including Albina Guarnieri , believe that he is necessary of codifier the way way . 
in short , ces20 last years , the jurisprudence has shifted in a sense who fact that , today today , the judges not are not inspired to impose of the , consecutive . 
if . could to to the time of 1980 and replicating the trial Mr. Olson , can - be his sentence would - she completely different of his condemnation to 11 , prosper of diversion to life and the jurisprudence would all other . 
we not must not forget that a be human not has that a only life to live . 
this is all to fact true . 
by example , to the States - United , the courts do of the , of 200 or 300 years . 
that not the fact not to the Canada . 
in the history of the only capital , . find of the criminals conducted several time . 
and , a human could be condamnée to be décapitée for a crime , this who was generally the fate should to the aristocrates . 
she could be condamnée to die écartelée , mutilée or brûlée in of the oil . 
he there had of many ways of killing several time the same human . 
, the end of the years 1790 , Small J . I. Guillotin has invented the guillotine , also barbare that that can we may of our days , that was considered to the time as a progress fantastique as way of punishing the criminals . 
. occupation to the time that all the people human not had that a life to losing and that they not should die that a only time . 
left Guillotin has presented his reform , he has said that a be human should die only a time and that his death was be quick . 
I hope have helped someone little my hon. colleague . 
the hon. Pierre Claude Nolin : 
in the speech , her the senator Cools has she said Mr. Olson not will never free ? 
the senator Cools : 
yes , I I said someone something of the kind . 
the senator Nolin : 
if this man will stay in other for the rest of his life , could - she we explain why the law of the right will allow to this individual of stay in other for the still of his life ? 
the senator Cools : 
this not is not a question of law of the right . 
Mr. . Olson has been court to the diversion to perpétuité and the courts can be the reopened after 15 years of the Eligibility to a bombing Earl . 
when I I said Mr. Olson not would never free , I not would can - be not should use the word " never " . 
I would should say that to this at - this , all the system and all the people working in the system Mr. Olson know very well the horror Mr. Olson based to any the people . 
I say to the honourable senators that this sentiment public very very is a factor contraignant . 
that is wished clear this day - that to the hearing who has had place to Surrey , in British - British . 
I am here for say to the honourable senators , and to the senator Nolin in particular , that if the public cessait a moment of follow the matter Olson , he the could well that this man nervous , of a way or of a other , to obtain his implementation in freedom . 
of the held which I I heard say that they tueraient a time true of other , I in I seen a great number . 
when I say that I the I heard say these things , I want say that he was fact says in the reports of their intention of killing to their exit of other . 
I say to the hon. senator that , the he the find a day opposite to opposite with some of these individuals , as that me is came in the system carcéral , he will have afraid . 
when we considering the bill of bill C - 45 , we had a list of held back of the an of the clause 745 of the Code criminal , which some that I had were me - same when I at to the Board national of the libérations conditional . 
in " the list , I me am reminded in particular of the behalf of a nation who had said to who wanted the hear that he off and tuerait to new . 
the senator Nolin : 
we age . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , the period of time the for the speech and the questions is completed . 
of agreed . 
the senator Nolin : 
honourable senators , not we méprenons not . 
if the Board of the libérations conditional has the power of take a decision , this is because that the bill him authority this power . 
when I about of the law of the right , this is exactly of that that I about . 
I am am of hear that the senator Cools , a former member of the Board , had the right of take a such decision in as that Commissioner . 
she we said now that she was outset , to the time , that some of the individuals who appeared before she were of future criminals , but that she not has nothing fact . 
the senator Cools : 
we we taken of the measures . 
the senator Nolin : 
the find - they still in other ? 
the senator Cools : 
in this case particular , I I dropped the regime of freedom wheat which he bénéficiait . 
he is business in other . 
I about of many years more later . 
the senator Nolin : 
you prouvez this that I soutiens . 
the bill , to the Canada , give all the power to the commission and to the different ministers of the Justice of the provinces . 
I not think not that the . can réhabiliter a such individual . 
this that I say , this is that the laws current can deal these problems for little that they be colleague properly , not is - this not ? 
the senator Cools : 
the senator Nolin : 
if that not enough not , her the senator think she that two or three , consecutive are a solution ? 
the senator Cools : 
this that I say to the senator , and he me includes without doubt very well , this is that four principles must govern the determination of the only , and not any what Justice or jury must to the of these four principles the each after the other . 
the a of these principles is the neutralisation , this is - to - say that he must prevent the offender of make a other crime . 
this that I say to the senator - well that he répugne to the admit , but I will do of my better for the persuade , but he must admit that this will difficult - this is that he there has someone something to correct . 
honourable senators , I I under the " a clause of newspaper who me has been has he there has few days . 
he there is question of a nation called Adrian Kinkead , which I not had never heard speak . 
I not know not all the details and I not am not very well typifies , because I not I not taken knowledge of the because . 
I is my information of this only clause . 
in this case - this , the prosecutor of the Department public has asked to the Justice of aside the judgment until to the Adopted of this bill of bill . 
that he the whether of this case - this or of a other , I say to the senator Nolin that , in our evolution policy , we in are people to a at where the Parliament must give a some attention to these questions . 
the senator Nolin : 
the senator we ask of we deal on a change of principle to the second Reading . 
the senator Cools : 
he not there has not of change of principle . 
the senator Nolin : 
this is this that the senator ask . 
explain - you because until here , you not the you not fact . 
the senator Cools : 
he not there has not of change . 
the senator Nolin : 
in the last response that her the senator has made , she has fact reference to the four principles . 
I think that he would good of do know or of remind to to the honourable senators that he there has only few decades , we fouettions still the violeurs to the Canada . 
the senator Cools : 
certainly , we had the usual of the Canada . 
the senator Nolin : 
why we - we changed this used ? 
, comments , we not lifelong more these people - that of the " violeurs " . 
the senator Finestone : 
how the " - you now ? 
the senator Nolin : 
I believe that . the Order of the " perpetrators sexual " . 
we we shifted . 
the only not the reduced not only to the punish . 
the senator Cools : 
this is a bad example , but care will . 
the senator Nolin : 
let - me conclusion of question my question , I you please . 
I I left the hon. senator conclusion the speech . 
today today , he not the is more only of punishing . 
the determination of the only the based on some principles and her the senator must explain to this House , before that we not we prononcions to the step of the second Reading , what principle she wishes see change , why she to that he be changed , and in what this change affectera he the other principles . 
if she so to me convince , I be happy of the support . 
I not believe not that the senator the be really explained until here , of the least of after this that I I heard . 
can - be should - we refer the bill of bill to a committee before of we deal to the step of the second Reading , because he there has that not difficulty of principles in stake . 
the hon. senator has fact out that he there had consensus for not not restore the only of death . 
why ? 
he must well there have of the reasons . 
the senator Cools : 
I not doubt not of the ; of the senator . 
I I said that I would liked the see the interest all as to the bill of bill C - 45 , by example . 
personally , the bill of bill C - 247 based in particular - and the committee is guest to hear of the witnesses as the upon Manfredi and Knopff - on the four principles of the determination of the only . 
the legislation legislative parliament to apply of way more retooled the principle of the proportionnalité , the who to that the only be proportional to the offence commise . 
I I a little of difficulty to understand how the hon. senator can argue that the bill of bill not is not consistent to the principles of the determination of the only and I him ask why . 
this bill of bill has already been adopted to the House of the Commons and , in the framework of the Adopted , I poured that of many people the have examined . 
this bill of bill of initiative Parliamentary not is not new . 
that fact four years that he is examined and examined by the House of the Commons . 
I specific to the hon. senator that the bill of bill respect and confirms the principle of the vectors , the principle of the psychiatric , the principle of the neutralisation and the principle of the proportionnalité . 
this are that the four principles of the determination of the only . 
the bill of bill is perfectly consistent to these principles . 
of more , on the plans policy and legal , he based on the grounds created by the government . 
this is the government who has created the clause 745 who allows to the judges , this who not the was never seen , of establish the time of when . 
this is on this clause that the based the bill of bill . 
the - this is consistent not only to the principles of the determination of the only , but also to the political who have been adopted by the government these last years and who taking the form of legislation - legislation as the Bill bill C - 45 , his version current and that the inclusion of the new clause 745 to the Code criminal . 
the senator Nolin : 
I am course that in the study of this question , the hon. senator knows that the a of the principles in stake is the Charter of the rights and freedoms . 
the senator Cools : 
that he me the confidence . 
I I examined the Charter . 
the senator Nolin : 
for this the things to the clear , in the case of a contrevenant who the see impose two , , is - this that the diversion to life correspondrait to a only minimum of 50 years ? 
the senator Cools : 
this not is not of the all this that move the legislation . 
can - be the senator not includes he not the bill of bill . 
the senator Nolin : 
what would the minimum of a only of diversion to life ? 
the senator Cools : 
the minimum rest the same for the time in the bill . 
the Assent the by the bill is resuming in this bill of bill . 
the senator not the has can - be not including , but then - I hope the in persuade ? 
the bill of bill allows to the Justice , in the case of the given of , many for murder , of repudiate of a day or of a year additional the date of Eligibility to the bombing Earl . 
and , if a human is judged , inculpée and condamnée to of the , many for murder to the Prime or to the second degree , the Justice can decide of a only of 10 years by example for the Prime murder then add two or three years of diversion before that the human can be eligible to the freedom Earl . 
the hon. senator seems believe that the bill of bill the summer of add 25 years to the only to purger . 
not . 
the bill of bill limit simply the margin of RRSP of the magistrat . 
by therefore , in under of this bill of bill , the Justice can add to the sentence a year , or two , or three , or more , until to competition of a safeguarded of 25 years . 
I hope that the senator includes to present . 
the senator Nolin : 
the hon. senator must give a explanation clear to the honourable senators . 
the he is poses that a individual has killed three people to of the opportunities separate and in of the contexts different , three , of diversion to perpétuité him will cut . 
he not is not question here of a year , of two years and of three years . 
the senator Cools : 
yes , this is this which he is question . 
the senator Nolin : 
her the senator would - she the please of me explain that ? 
the senator Cools : 
I am pleased of provide a explanation to the hon. senator . 
in of other words , as I the I said before , Albina Guarnieri the is seconded on the touchstone legislative created by the clause 745 , who allows the Justice to repudiate the date of Eligibility to the bombing Earl . 
this is the regime present . 
the bill of bill will to the Justice , in the framework of a other only , of add two years or five years to the period of inadmissibilité to the bombing Earl . 
this aspect of the bill of bill is very astucieux because he the based exactly of the reaching who has led to the development of the clause 745 and to the amendments to the clause 745 in the bill of bill C - 45 . 
the reaching is exactly the same . 
the senator Nolin : 
what would the safeguarded ? 
the senator Cools : 
the bill of bill specific however that the power Supplementary who is " to the Justice of repudiate the date of inadmissibilité to the bombing Earl is deduct to 25 years additional . 
this is the limit . 
the senator Nolin : 
this is 25 years additional . 
the senator Cools : 
this not is not 25 years additional . 
this is a total Supplementary of 25 years . 
the senator Nolin : 
this is this that you just of say . 
the senator Cools : 
I not I not said that . 
in of other words , the only of diversion to perpétuité remains . 
the nation purge always a only of diversion to perpétuité . 
by therefore , the powers greatest who have been Duty to the Justice to the clause 745 are the same that those that move the bill of bill C - 247 , except that he the is of a version extended by report to the version of the clause 745 . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , before of adjourn the debate to the behalf of the a of my colleagues , I like to on the speech very interesting and very important that the senator Cools has given this after - afternoon and who raises several questions . 
I must by that his or of Sigmund Freud expliquant this that is a bothers sociopathique of the president has had my attention . 
I am course that the " of the psychanalyse , who has been created by Sigmund Freud , the are their own idea of the reasons who follows why the people the conventions as they the are , particularly in the people fall by this legislation legislative . 
he would however négligent of our share of not not out that he there of many other théories on the president . 
I think , by example , that the school of psychologie of Alfred Adler , a image many more positive of the president human , and that same the school of psychanalyse of Carl Gustav addressed , a image many least has of the president human , there including in the case of those who could be diagnostiqués as with of unrest sociopathiques of the president . 
he there has also a school of psychologie , donor and social , who consider that the president human is malléable and a of be corrigée and développée on the plan social . 
this that I want add to this debate , this is that , according the psychologists owned to various other schools , the people human can be réadaptés and change election of behaviour . 
I not like not that . rest on a Appendix pessimiste , who just , I think , of the theory échafaudée by Sigmund Freud . 
that said , honourable senators , I move the adjournment of the debate to the behalf of the senator Nino Nino . 
( on the motion of the senator Kinsella , to the behalf of the senator Nino Nino , the debate is adjourned . )

the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Oliver , seconded by the hon. senator Nino Nino : 
that the documents received and the evidence heard by the Committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional to the over of the study of the Bill bill S - 17 , Act amend the Code criminal relatively to the harassment criminal and to of other issues related , during of the first session of the 30 - sixth Parliament , be claimants to the Committee , when he will been set , for the , study of the bill of bill S - 6 . - ( 
the hon. senator Cools ) . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the point in question respect the point to the Rules of the senator Kinsella to the about of the wording of this motion . 
I me am already given that - that . 
the senator Kinsella want can - be add someone something . 
he the is of a ask of confusion on the to - comments of this motion , including the referred of the documents already received and of the evidence already heard by the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional . 
I recognize now the speak to the senator Cools . 
the hon. Anne C . Cools : 
honourable senators , as I I been stand during any the time who just of the allowed , I like , if this is possible , that this case be surgeons to tomorrow . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , we not we opposerions not to the adjournment of the motion of the senator Oliver . 
however , that we would if . could deal the order to the Rules that I I fact because that we are now before of a motion introduced by the senators of this side - this and of a notice of motion presented by the senators of in opposite . 
I believe understand that the senator Cools has many worked to other something this after - afternoon and that His the must the Senator more later . 
however , he the can that to of other opportunities , the senators " that of the evidence precedents be claimants to a committee . 
since he there has two schools of of on the question , I believe that we should deal that today today , before that His the not leaving the Senate . 
, the page 90 of the é of the Senate of the 3 November 99 , the senator Oliver attention the existence of precedents . 
he unless that the formulation exactly of his motion found in a motion regarding the committee Senate Standing of the Peoples aboriginal . 
this after - afternoon , the report of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign regarding the study on the Europe we has been circulated . 
, the second page of the report , the order of referred is reproduit . 
in this order of referred , . find exactly the same formulation , to know that the documents received and the evidence heard on the about , and that the business through by the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign to the over of the first session of the , Parliament should be claimants to the committee . 
we are of notice that we should continue of deal these questions as we the we fact by the past . 
the senator Cools : 
honourable senators , I will answer for not not losing the opportunity of say few words on this order to the Rules . 
the Parliament has closed the session he there has few months and he has now resumed his activities . 
for well understand this question , he must the look on the question of the deliberations of committees who not were not completed to the time of the prorogation . 
, my notice , the bill of bill C - 7 is completely différentdu bill of bill S - 17 . 
we not must not forget that , when a bill of bill is referred to a committee , in the case present the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , this is exactly that where he the find . 
he is stymied that . 
he has been left to the committee . 
he must then the ask how the Senate can refer to a committee a matter which he not has never taken knowledge . 
when a committee receives a matter of the Senate , he must imperatives to the ask in student the bill of bill . 
this is the report of the committee who fact faith of the respect of the ask who him has been made . 
I I s in hands a or , senator Kinsella . 
. about of a bill of bill who has been referred . 
the comment 874 of Beauchesne , sixth edition , specific clear that : 
the committee who not has not debated the inquiry to the end of a session can do report to the House of this fact , and that of the evidence that he has heard . 
the report establishes that of the evidence have been heard . 
he can in addition recommend that to the session next the House him policies the same matter and that he can the serve of the evidence recueillie until - that . 
in the case of the bill of bill C - 7 , who was proposed by the government with the support of any the equipment government and the full Authorized of the caucus of a party represented to the Senate , the procedure to follow was therefore that the chairman of the committee the " to the Senate and , a report receive that the study of the bill of bill was ... and that the committee someone make the Position that he défendrait more later , since the governments ressuscitent all the issues important which they are before . 
spend simply of the ) 874 to the ) 875 , who 6 this who following : 
, least that the House not the allows to in to the , a committee not can do report of the evidence people before a committee similar during of a session order , except under form of appendice . 
the words performatifs here are " to in to the " . 
other said , in the case of the senator Milne , who chaired the committee and who not ménage not his efforts , the government has interest to bye the evidence already made before the committee and to power speed the business of the committee . 
the senator Milne and the members of the committee would do report of the evidence during the session in over . 
he must also think that , in General , a committee can always study and use the documents and the business of a other committee , even his own business and evidence . 
in this case - this , the committee of the Affairs legal to do report of the evidence heard . 
of after me , this is that he has the intention of ask the Authorized of the Senate , pursuant to this that 6 clear Beauchesne . 
the question that he must question is the next : the Authorized of do what ? 
as the Senate not has never received of report of the committee on or the a or the other of these bills of bill , he not has no knowledge of the study of these two bills of bill . 
by therefore , we not we not need , to the over of the , session , of a order of referred of the Senate for refer the evidence to the committee , because the Senate not the to not in his possession , he not can the refer . 
this that he must , this is that the Senate question a hardships in good and properly form to the committee for him ask , when he will this new bill of bill , of examine the evidence that he has received to the about of the other bill of bill . 
this that he must , this is a order of the Senate , a hardships , Requesting to the committee of examine these evidence in his deliberations , and not that the Senate veterinary of the documents that he not has not in his possession . 
honourable senators , he the is that of two bills of bill different , and the bill of bill C - 7 deserves of be examined of way make and satisfactorily . 
the bill of bill C - 7 has been presented of new to the House of the Commons and examined to any steamship . 
in substance , the Commons have been a order the Motion to the examine quickly and to the adopt after three lectures . 
by therefore , if the senator Milne and the committee and that the senator Fraser wish study the bill of bill C - 7 with any the expeditiously deal , he enough , he me seems , of the conform to the procedure . 
the good way of do not is not of ask to the Senate of refer of the evidence that he not has not , but of ask to the committee of examine these evidence in his deliberations . 
I hope that I I been clear , if I would pleased of me explain more length . 
when the senator Oliver has presented this motion , with the consent unanimous , I me am adjourned and I him I asked the he the was of a education to the committee . 
he not had can - be not read the clause of the Rules , but I believe that his motion was proposed pursuant to the ) 58 ( 1 ) . 
in response to my question , he has said that he not the was not of a education to the committee . 
the ( 58 ( 1 ) f ) the reads as following : 
Peoples instructions to a committee . 
by therefore , the motion is essentially a education to the committee . 
I had provided speak more length of the motion of the senator Oliver tomorrow and propose a amendment that he would been easy of to , to know , replace the word " referred " by " examined " . 
but this is now all to fact there . 
he we is , in as that part Maritimer and opérante of the Parliament of the Canada , of to attention to the procedure exactly of Presented of the motions . 
we are sometimes a little negligent , though the word be very very . 
we how many of things that we could do better in there focused a all small effort . 
the purpose of the notice of motion of the senator Fraser is essentially of before the committee of the question in subject of way fair and get to that the committee can give to the bill of bill the kind of review and of attention that he deserves . 
honourable senators , I would probably better fact if I had whereas to tomorrow for to these questions , but I not wanted not losing the opportunity of the do today today . 
in fact , the committee is free of study the evidence of all the other witnesses . 
the only something that he not can do , this is this who is , by the comment 875 ; he not can do report of the evidence people retained except under form of appendice . 
the committee has the powers which he has need . 
this was simply a prerequisite Supplementary . 
the the the Speaker : 
if no other hon. senator not to take the speak , I am prepared to to my decision . 
decision of the Speaker 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when this question has been raised the first time , I I consulted the precedents to the Senate . 
I will now try of present my explanation in a order logical . 
however , if the . afterthought the é of the Senate of the 3 November , this who the is said when the senator Oliver has proposed the motion is clear : 
... with the leave of the Senate and nonobstantl' ( 58 ( 1 ) f ) ... 
the the the Speaker : 
the leave is - she granted ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the motion of the senator Oliver was therefore valid because that the leave had been granted . 
second , I want refer the honourable senators to the part I of the Rules of the Senate who the entitled " Interprétation " and who for : : 
( 1 ) cases all the case not some to the Rules , the Senate or his committees looking , with the adaptations necessary , the customs , biodegradable , formalités and procedures of the a or the other of the Houses of the Parliament of the Canada . 
he is clear that our Rules , our biodegradable and our customs have above on the literature of reference such that the Bourinot or the Beauchesne . 
we consultons of first our Rules , then we let our biodegradable and our precedents . 
the hon. senator Kinsella has explained in detail two of our biodegradable and precedents . 
in the case of the motion introduced more earlier today today by the hon. senator Stewart , the order of referred is clear : 
that the documents received and the evidence heard and the work work by the Committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign to the over of the first session of the 30 - sixth Parliament be claimants to the Committee ; 
in addition , the senator Oliver , as the has indicated the senator Kinsella , has said of new the 3 November , to the page 90 of the é of the Senate , that that had been fact to a other opportunity . 
he we veterinary to the Journals of the Senate of the 2 April 1998 , page 584 , where . reads that the documents received and the evidence heard to the about of the bills of bill S - 10 and S - 12 have been claimants to the committee for the study of the bill of bill S - 14 . 
I can find of other precedents if the senators the looking . 
however , such is , to my knowledge , the practice usual of the Senate . 
. welcomes of this way to of not not forward the witnesses to come testify a second time on the same about and of not not have to replicating any the research a second time on a question who has already been most by a committee Senate or the Senate . 
this is and that the ask the practice observed in the past and this is and that she has shifted . 
the senator Cools we has claimants to the Beauchesne . 
as I the I fact out , our practices have above on the Beauchesne . 
however , same if you read the comment 874 of the Beauchesne , he is well said that the committee " can do report to the House . " 
, my notice , that not excludes not , then , that the Senate resolution a other practice because that he not there has nothing of required . 
he not is not said that if that not has not been fact , . not can adopt a other practice . 
our practice was different . 
I Justice that we can study the motion of the senator Oliver . 
want - you that the question rest on to the behalf of the senator Cools ? 
the senator Cools : 
yes . 
the the the Speaker : 
she will therefore to the behalf of the senator Cools . 
( the question remains on to the behalf of the senator Cools . ) 
the Conference on the equality and the participation of the women to the life public 
inquiry 
the hon. Lorna Milne , to given notice the 2 November 99 : 
that she call the attention of the Senate on his participation regarding the 70e anniversary of the case " human " in the framework of the Conference on the equality and the participation of the women to the life public to the Canada and to the Kingdom - Kingdom who the is held to London , in England , the 21 and 22 October . 
this series of conferences has been hosted by Debra Davis and the is held to the House of the Canada , to Trafalgar Square , for celebrate the 70e anniversary of the judgment of the committee judicial of the Council private British grateful that the women are of the people in bill . 
as no senator Canadian not had been bow to this conference or same informed of his held , I I agreed that I devais there go . 
I me am made to London - to my own costs , must - I add - represent the parliamentarians Liberal of the Canada to the conference . 
the conference was divided in several sittings of work , which I will mention few - few . 
Nancy Ruth , which the great - father has been a lawyer of the group of the five women celebrities , has open the conference the Thursday 21 October and we has shown a aspect little different of the history of the case " human " . 
in 1929 , the government cast of her MacDonald had of be elected in Britain - Britain . 
the membership of the committee judicial of the Council private had changed , and the time was perfect for a such decision . 
the judges have said , in their decision , that the Constitution was as a tree living and that she was therefore communications with the time . 
however , to the Canada , despite the battle that she had win , Faries by was a conservatrice of the Western and the first opening to the Senate was in Ontario . 
when the very hon. R . B . Bennett , a Progressive - Conservative , is became Prime Minister , that has created a opening in the Western , but Bennett has supported that he wanted appoint a Catholic since the last senator to be appointed was a protestant . 
I believe that this not was that a apologize for not not appoint Faries . 
the conférencière next has been Frances Wright , of Calgary . 
she is chairman - Director general of the Famous Five Honorary . 
she has she - same met the funds necessary , with the assistance generous of five Canadians , which a seat with we to the Senate , nommément the senator Poy , who not is not here in the time . 
she was among the generous donatrices who have contributed financially to the basic of this wonderful when to Calgary . 
the when has been dévoilée the 18 October , to the opportunity of the fiftieth anniversary of the decision of the Council private . 
the year next , a other when will dévoilée on the Hill of the Parliament , all close of here , between the Block of the East and the part of the Block of the Centre where is located the Senate . 
the week last , I me am arrêtée briefly to Calgary after have attended to the meeting general Annual of the Party Liberal of the Canada , who the is held to Edmonton , in Alberta . 
, Calgary , I I could visit this new every performance . 
me the sat a time on the Chair of Faries , a woman in chemisier is exit in aware of a dining seat . 
he the was of Francis Wright , who surveillait the implement . 
this is a woman of a subject intellect and very douée . 
she has spoke of the situation of the women professional in Britain - Britain and has expressed the notice very frankly . 
some of the statistics public that she has quotations 18.7 that the women are conspicuously of the high court of justice of Britain - Britain and that they are very little many to have the as of counsel of the Queen , and that in despite of the fact that 25 per of the lawyers enrolled to the notaires of this country be of the women . 
she has said : 
you know all the history of Allerednic ... 
the Cardinal wife a princesse and the equip in souillon . 
this is apparently the sad reality for many of women British . 
the second group of discussion had for theme " Ban the périphérie to the centre : 
do hear the Senators of the women " . 
he was led by Sandra Anstey , chairman of Anstey Associates , of Toronto . 
she has underlined that the Nations Nations had greeted the Canada to the Prime among in the world in this who respect the equality of the women . 
the baronne Crawley , chairman of the Board national of the women in Britain - Britain , Moon to this sitting . 
she has said : 
the Canada has well often shown the seaway to follow , in prônant courageusement the equality between the sexes . 
, the Kingdom - Kingdom , the last government cast has fact elected several women to the House of the Commons , but they are still least of 20 per of the members . 
however , in the new Parliament écossais , on the 139 members , 48 are of the women . 
in England , 40 per of the students in right are now of the women , but the Affairs senior of the profession of the right and of the there are a bastion of men , and they have a impact enormous on the life to the Kingdom Kingdom 
the Board of the equality of the opportunity has 25 years in Britain - Britain . 
he the is of a body legislative independent , who the 15 commissioners to their office to London and to Manchester . 
they have the power of to of the investigations official , but not the have not fact since of the years . 
Ms Barshevkin has issue the theme " - challenge of the human : 
the citizenship of the women in a perspective contemporary " . 
she has supported that number of changes régressifs s since the case " human " have profoundly influencing on the Position and the rights of the women least favorisées . 
the leaders current of the " third civil " to the States - United , to the Canada and in Britain - Britain not are not still define for drama the damage . 
good number of the interventions and a great part of the discussion who have followed have brought on the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms and on the fact that the women British would well that their country the detailed of a charter similar . 
Susan , , conseillère key in equality of the sexes to the Department federal of the Justice , has out that the Charter Canadian is into on the rights actions of groups and not of individuals and that this fact only has many amended the right Canadian and the jurisprudence Canadian . 
she recognizes however that he the is still of a culture and of a community very masculins , same to the within of the Department of the Justice and certainly to the within of the Department of the Finance , to the Canada . 
by Opposition , Lucy Makinson , conseillère in policy to the Board of Majesty Majesty , has claimed that of great progress had recently been made for this who is of answer to the concerns of the women to the within of this Department . 
however , the Board not has always not really affordably to the operating the questions féminines , then that 45 per of the women British working still to time part and that the salary way of the women is of 80 per on to the of the men for a work of equal value . 
in the debate who has followed , MLA Brown , of the British - British , who is now chairman of the Centre international MATCH , has mentioned that the Charter is a lame to two tranchants and that he there has of the case where of the men the use , with their resources and contacts senior , to the backs of women . 
she has the to attention that in fact , he there had can - be of the Picard political féminines to the television British to the time current , but that the editors political are still particularly masculins . 
Trima McQueen , the chairman - chairman Lillian of CTV , has said that the media not understood all simply not . 
she has quoted some new recent to the Canada . 
all of first , the new Gouverneure general of the Canada , Adrienne Clarkson , has been immediately attaquée in the media to the about of his prétendues gaps in as that mother , particularly by of the editors féminines . 
of more , the Court Supreme has decided that the aboriginal could fishing for the esteem in all time . 
when the system English of the Corporation CBC - Canada has used the term neutre " fishers " , that has raised a é home a group of women the caveats to the fishing . 
when the Court Supreme has decided that the government federal was to his long féminines of the rétroactivité for a work of equal value , the National Financial has claimed that the Court Supreme was between the hands of féministes like . 
Yvonne Roberts , a journalist pigiste , described : 
the media British are a officine of the power , the men to the power and the women the reléguées in the officines ! 
the women who are and who who then for rise their children or the lead to a other career are generally attacked , because they not are not ready to " do opposite to the music " . 
the situation of the women in Britain - Britain for this who is of the coverage in the media and their participation to this community is all to fact terrible . 
during the sitting entitled : " - women and the right : 
promotion of the rights of the woman before the courts " , Carissima Mathen , Director of the from of LEAF , has spoke of " Faire hear our Senators , " the experience Canadian in the of rights to the equality who duration now since 20 years in under of the Charter . 
she has underlined that the given that the judges not are not elected to the within of the regime of right British , they can the allow of be impopulaires on the plan policy and of to of the judgments politically impopulaires , but legally decent . 
Anuja Dhir , lawyer of London , has spoke of the Affairs recent the more troublantes to be victimized in Britain - Britain . 
first , the rape matrimonial has been legal in Britain - Britain during 400 years the to a " verdict the in 1678 . 
in 1991 , the verdict the by a court of call has infirmé the fact that a husband had plaidé found for rape marital before a court of decision on . 
the woman has then interjeté call with of the House of the Lords , a little as have fact here the five women celebrities . 
a group of " Lords legal " not including that of the men has heard the call and administering that " the idea according which a woman was be the ownership of the husband not the was more and was blessante for the women " . 
that the was in 1991 . 
she has spoke of the mariages forced with many of emotion because that this is a used widespread to the within of his own culture south - Asian . 
the Court Supreme was opinions and had qualified this behaviour of kidnapping and of act criminal . 
the third example that Ms Dhir has used is the of the women battues who have killed their earnings own . 
well that this as is now to the Canada a part of Defence unfortunate , the invocation of the legitimate Defence or of the provocation as way of Defence require still to the Kingdom - Kingdom that he there that reaction immediate for that that be unfortunate . 
the as of the woman battue not there is not recognized . 
she has firmly fact point that " the equality not means not a treatment equal but to well say a result similar " . 
the result is the only part of legislation valid of the real equality . 
during the part next , the first oratrice has been the very hon. baronne Jay of Paddington , Horse RCCs of the Sceau Privé , Leader of the House of the Lords and Minister of the Condition of the woman . 
she has such the list of the measures legislation that the government Blair has adopted recently , there including this months - this a credit of tax for children who contained to the women . 
a regime national of salary minimum has been adopted . 
you you Boteler the ? 
this is the first time that he there has in Britain - Britain a salary minimum and this legislation the is traduite for 1.3 million of women by a increase of treatment . 
the hon. Hedy Frey , Secretary of state to the situation of the woman , has then taken the speak and has fact honour to the Canada . 
she has resumed of new the statistics Canadian and underlined to what point they the are upgraded to the over of the last years . 
she has spoke with eloquence of our Act on the equity in the of employment and of " the analysis based on the equality man - woman " that require now the bill Canadian . 
she has mentioned that the idea of a policy " Universal " of equality of the sexes has now been using . 
we mesurons now the equality in service of the results to the Canada and not in service of a required process of equality . 
not only the conference has been very enlightening , but she has represented for the Canada a good the in the of relations public . 
in effect , the press British we has spent in a only clause more of space that she not we in had spent during any a year . 
this clause was the implement of Yvonne Roberts and the intitulait : " Northern rights " . 
the week following the conference , she has récidivé with a clause all also long , entitled : " Under has blaze of Northern rights " , who was the he of the record chosen by the Canada . 
short , that has been a conference really remarkable , and I am proud of there have attended . 
the the the Speaker : 
if human of other not to speak , the debate on this inquiry will considered as debated . 
the federalism and the globalization 
inquiry 
the hon. rald - A . 
Beaudoin , to given notice the Tuesday 2 November 99 : 
- honourable senators , I I had the privilege , in October last , of participate to the Forum of the fédérations who the is the to the Les - Tremblant and who has met more of 550 representatives and experts . 
this conference touchait four great themes : the federalism , the citizenship and the diversity social ; the federalism economic and social ; the relations Intergovernmental in the fédérations ; the political Social and the federalism . 
more of 30 groups of work have been constitués for deal of a great number of issues , which the sharing of the powers , the globalization , the relations Intergovernmental and the citizenship . 
the two chairmen , can Rae and Henning Voshereau , have fact a work remarkable and have chaired more of a plenary which the a on the new Ways of the federalism . 
the Forum of the fédérations will a existence permanent . 
the next colloquium will place in Switzerland in two years . 
the government Canadian has paid a amount employees 500 $ $ for the held of the Forum of the fédérations . 
, my notice , this forum had his reason of be . 
I I had the good fortune of chairman a table NRTEE on the federalism and the globalization and this is on this about that I like today today say few words . 
, the era modern , the Canada is the a of the more one fédérations ; he is the third , after the States - United , in 1789 , and the Switzerland , in 1848 . 
our Constitution has many shifted . 
the history we Federated that we we of the phases of centralisation and of décentralisation . 
we are now in a stage of décentralisation . 
little of country have spent as of time and of energy that the ours to the changeover of a federalism balanced . 
. note , in the world , a interest growing for the federalism . 
as the fact out the professeurRonald Watts , who was a acteur thus to the Forum of the fédérations : 
he there has ninety - five years , he not there had to the world that a only newspaper and two centres of research on the federalism . 
he there today today several newspapers , and the Association international of the centres of studies of the federalism , who the meeting each year , the 23 centres and instituts dans15 country over on the five continents . 
he is good of the look on some caractèristiques of our Constitution and of the question on the consequences that the globalization could have . 
in the of treated , the Canada has adopted the system dualiste . 
in several country , the signing of a treaty change the bill of the country . 
he must in more , to the Canada , legislation for to in Bill the treaty who has been signed . 
according the jurisprudence , this is the authority federal who sign the treated . 
for to in Bill a treaty , he must follow the sharing of the skills legislation between the federal and the provinces . 
and in has decided the jurisprudence in apprehensive , and this jurisprudence not has not have since . 
this sharing of skills reflects well the needs of the Canada , to my notice , of as more that we we two systems of right private : the right Civil for the Quebec and the " way way " for the other provinces . 
, the Canada , this is the authority federal who can legislation extraterritorialement , who émet the passeports and who manages the policy foreign . 
, the within of the Agency of cooperation cultural and technical , the Quebec and the New - Brunswick have the same status of government participant . 
the government federal has agreed in some case that of the ministers provincial do part of the delegations Canadian to the abroad and so the chairman to the opportunity or act to as of chairman - chairmen . 
the 17 November 1965 , the Canada and the France have signed a Agreement cultural franco - Canadian who habilitait the provinces to conclude of the agreements directly with the France in the area of the culture . 
a province can , to the within of this agreed - framework , conclude of the agreements directly with the France . 
if the agreement today the framework of the agreed , then the federal must the ratify for him legislation a would . 
good number of agreements France - Quebec have been treaties of this way . 
the arrangements administrative are came add a part Supplementary of flexibility to the within of our system federal . 
they not incomplete not the Constitution , but facilitent the application . 
they are necessary in the federalism modern . 
he there has had to the Canada a agreed administrative in December 1975 between the authority federal and the provinces in the area of the rights of the human . 
this agreed fixed the mechanisms of cooperation and of directly of the two levels of government in the phases of application to the Canada of the rights of the human . 
the federalism modern , in the perspective of the globalization , becomes of more in more of appropriate . 
and , the ratification of the Agreement of free Exchange North - American has heavy the process of globalization in America . 
the trade and the trade not are almost more of boundaries . 
he in is and in the other parties of the world , in Europe , by example . 
the impact of the globalization the fact feel to all the levels : commercial , cultural and policy . 
of same , the diminution of the sovereignty of the States to the profit of great ending - the NAFTA , Union European - is of more in more visible . 
the state federal can promote the participation of his components to the process of globalization all in ensuring the cohesion of his policy foreign . 
, the Canada , . think spontanément to the member of the Francophonie . 
he could ceased of other areas . 
as the " the professor Richard Simeon to the Forum of the fédérations to the Les - Tremblant : 
what that be the good point of view , he is clear that with the globalization , the federalism not has not of ceased to the border : the forces global have of the effects powerful on the relations to the level national , and the uniqueness federal of the country is inevitably projeté on the scene international . 
in conclusion , I quote few citations of the Presented of the professor Earl H . Fry to the Forum of the fédérations , who the is the to the Les - Tremblant in October 99 : 
he is obvious that he will increase the consultation and the cooperation between the governments if the plans federal want benefit of the many opportunities who their are educational and reduce to the minimum the impact separate of the globalization . 
, the enter of the new century , he there has very strong opportunity that the trend to the globalization the accentue still and that the interconnection between the economies local , national and international the heritage . 
the model Canadian is can - be a good point of departure for the fédérations désireuses of to on at or of peaufiner the institutions and procedures Intergovernmental necessary for the adapt to the globalization to the st century . 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
if no other hon. senator not wishes take the speak , the debate on this inquiry will debated . 
the situation of the aboriginal and their future 
inquiry - Adjourned of the debate 
the hon. Aurélien Gill , to given notice lejeudi 4 November 99 : 
that he call the attention of the Senate on the situation of the aboriginal to of we allow of do the point and of reflect on the measures appropriate for the future . 
I not you surprendrais not not more if I you was share of my enthusiasm and of my faith . 
since a year , I be , I hear and I hear . 
he is time now of take the speak . 
my identity and my life witnessing of my principles and of my convictions . 
when I taking in back , I note how was difficult , during my time of life , the fight for the simple recognition of this that I am . 
I I participated to this fight , to this combat , to this réveil and , on this long move , I I often the my principles to the when . 
I consider as a duty of me serve of my Position to the Senate for still better express this to what I believe and this why I I lived the life who was the my . 
the speak the a message , he must the say and the repeat , with always more of serious and of wisdom . 
the speak is often all this that he we rest . 
you see that I rise my role to the seriously and I the take and as and also long that he me will given of power me express publicly . 
the Senate is s the place for of these words serious that we meetings in we , of the words who we with all and who have a interest national . 
the Prime Minister of the Canada , Mr. Jean tien , démontrait the opening of spirit in me him to the Senate . 
the question of the Nations Nations is of a great importance for the Canada . 
he in will of the future . 
we the let too often as a degrading , a order of the grandchildren cauchemars recurring which we we happen the time of the forget . 
however , the heart of the question not is that rarely issue . 
this is in the air of the time that of speak of the new millennium who the which before we . 
the 20 century not will not been favourable to the aboriginal of this country . 
the 19 century had been assistance and infested . 
that fact therefore 200 years that our Nations are the systemic - pain of the history . 
we we been dépouillés of our identités . 
our Lands were spoliées . 
the treated not have not been respected , . we has the in tutelage . 
we fûmes overlooked in the who 60 of the addiction , of the paternalism , purposes of a bill inique , prisoners of the reserves Indian , submitted to all the pressure of the assimilation . 
can - we hope that the next century be finally the of the one , of the recovery and of the rebirth ? 
to long been on the furthering of these struggles , my notice must well have someone negative . 
in as that former Leader of the Nations montagnaises and of the Attikameks , to the as of former Leader of my community of Mashteuiatsh , to IAFSP - Bleue , I am of those who argue that we even now of time . 
he there has emergency in the remains . 
if someone change basic not is not took soon in our loss policy , I I the conviction that the things tourneront difficulty . 
for the moment , we greatest of the time to the room , in the hope that each the résorbe . 
since 20 years , he in is and : 
Kanesatake , Ipperwash , Gustafsen Lake and Burnt Church . 
he is happy that no not that really dérapé . 
each would could we plonger in of the drames many more evolving that this that we we known until to this day . 
I not can stay silent on of the issues of a if great importance because here , the silence is disappointment . 
well course , since 40 years , we we all fact of the move . 
we we same reached a point that the . not could imagine when I was young man . 
more human not degenerated the fact that we are the first people of this country . 
we greatest on this land , today today called Canada , since of the millénaires . 
the Constitution Canadian testimony of our right . 
however , if our right is should in the document founding of the nation , the content of this right rest a mystery to the " of several . 
jadis , in a past who not is not if way , our ancestors have received the new arrivants and they the have drafting . 
the first part of the history of our relations in is a of partnership . 
this not is that more later that the on of the guest has changed . 
yes , he would réécrire the history . 
we we a great share to this history , but this share we is also niée , as was denied our commitment to our Lands , as were niées our contributions to the survival , to the life and to the philosophical . 
he would none of the place , of the according , in a word of learn to the recount . 
Sachons that the concept of the two Nations fondatrices or Peoples founding we has fact very difficulty , to we of the Nations Nations . 
the Canada has is and well a chairman of foundation when he the is of build his representation national . 
how platform what that this be on a situation oversight , on a similar misunderstanding ? 
we we been and we are always . 
we we been useful in the war , in the trade , in the to of the foreign , in the alliances , in the amitiés , in the construction of this country . 
we we been and we are always , we the Montagnais Innus , we the Ouje , the Wendat , the Ojibways - Anishinabes , the Blackfoot - Siksika , the Assiniboines , the Lilioets , the Tsequoitin , the Haidas or the Gitchwin . 
we must see that despite all the efforts , despite the years who the écoulent , the great majority of the Canadians know the essential and the important in this who respect the Nations Nations . 
the last commission Royal on the about , the Board Erasmus - Dussault , the fact a time still , and she in was a eminent dramatique : yes , the Canadians know still the essential and this ignorance has of the consequences political . 
I say that she push on the will policy because , we the know all , the ignorance casts the prejudice and the prejudice exaspèrent . 
is the uproar that the . does . 
the existence and the persistance of this speech in the year 2000 are for all the Canadians a failure evolving . 
the Nations Nations not were for absolutely nothing in the drafting , the enacted and the application of the Act on the Indian . 
but who knows to the Canada the existence same of this bill , who in knows the nature , who can in measurement the tragic scope , the historic consequential ? 
the status of Indian Canadian in is a of under - citizenship . 
the bill applies the concept of tutelage . 
this long tutelage we has infantilisés and the history fact the evidence that we we all lost , there including our dignity . 
the Act on the Indian , well that overhaul and amended , there always in the spirit General . 
she has created , on a period of 125 years , a situation Spector , a world 60 , the world complex of the reserves Indian , the addiction eliminates , the who closed of the Affairs Indian . 
the Canadians in General , the Canadians well éduqués in particular , not are not the treated . 
they know still least that no treaty not has been respected by the state Canadian and the other governments . 
that the . point the misunderstandings , that the . the call to all the contingences that the . want , that not finds nothing to the results . 
we we been floués in all the dimensions of our identity , in all the recoins of our rights the more basic . 
but that rest a secret well touch . 
he enough of read and of hear our Picard and our thinkers the more distinguished for wasn , day after day , how the ignorance fact of the damage . 
. recognizes more easily the situation of the Timor oriental that the who pourrit to the within of our own country . 
the Canada not has always not fact the review of conscience in this who has relates to the Nations Nations . 
he there has had inequity to the regard of those who were eulogizing of the Sauvages , then of the Indian , then of the Amérindiens , then of the aboriginal , then . not knows more what invent . 
this great inequity perdure to the within of a society Canadian who claims not not the indiscriminate . 
nothing not is possible or not will possible without that this brèche his not be réparée , without that justice be made . 
I said that , during my time of life , we we fact of the move . 
unfortunately , the recognition of our rights seems play in our défaveur . 
the content of these rights remains a mystery , seems he . 
this recognition in exaspère more of a . 
in as that Peoples , we are by as of the threats . 
our destiny is became legal . 
we are coincés between the corridor étroit , for not not say abstrait , of the right , and the reality duration , for not not say tordue , of the prejudice on the ground of the true life . 
this is the history of the Nations Nations , the a we Much this that the other we refuses . 
a day or the other , he will in out . 
the Nations Nations their to the self , to the responsibility and to the dignity . 
for in out , s , he must parent the circle condemned of the tutelage and the hell of the addiction . 
the Affairs Indian related very sir to the Canadians and the results will negative . 
he is necessary and none of back to the Nations Nations a place in the loss Canadian , a place policy , economic and geographical . 
we défendons our rights , we défendons our identity , we we battons for our future to the within of the nation Canadian . 
I am senator and I am aboriginal . 
I not want not have shame of my country . 
I I worked any my life to the restoration of our rights , because we we the right of be and of be proud in as that Dene , in as that Inuit , in as that Sarcees or tis . 
a great fossé rest to fill , but he must the preferred . 
in the years who come , to from of this institution that is the Senate , I hear do my humble contribution to the value of the speak and of the wisdom . 
I thinkers on the wisdom . 
in this spirit , I will point to all the notice and advice that he me will possible of obtain in the levels of the contained and of Communications , because he is essential that the message what . 
we must all work to the opening of the spirit . 
in my interventions next , I me move of to before you with more of information . 
I me move of participate fully to the discussions of the committee Standing of the Peoples aboriginal . 
I am determined , to from of my position to the Senate and in the legislation of my ways , to all to in implement for thrust the debate in a sense positive . 
we we must all of rise the level of this debate and the action the more high is to inform the public Canadian of the issues enemies . 
he must fight all together the effects devastating of the misinformation , of the his quick , of the accusations replace . 
if we not réussissons not to do this debate to the Senate , who therefore there réussira ? 
despite any the ignorance ambiante who génère as of comrades , despite the fact that several our of the situation to from of a parcelle of information , he rest that the situation of the aboriginal is dramatique . 
will say to the Algonquins of the Abitibi , to the Ojibways of the west of the Ontario , to the Ouje of the west of the by of James , to the Tuchones of the Yukon that all will for the better in the better of the mondes . 
will visit the reserves Indian of the year 2000 , you will that he not there has not place of be hasn or sarcastique . 
: not is not a stake of word , this not are not of the views of the spirit . 
, the same as that the poverty , the question of the Nations Nations is this that I appellerais a emergency national . 
we must be refurbishing in our responsibilities . 
he is necessary of invent to the the national a structure who , for the moment , not there not . 
he must go more far that the Senator of right . 
the aboriginal must something of their present , of their future . 
already that the challenge is colossal , not would - he not finally statement that of we let the opportunity of the and ? 
in conclusion , I you say that the case will more far . 
if the Canada not find not the way of solve this case , the Canada not résoudra nothing in as that nation . 
he must certainly drama of emergency but he will also we expand , grow and help to the foreign economic and cultural of this country . 
the " indianité " not the nutshell not to the moccasins , to the dance and to the traditions . 
the Canada of tomorrow will also the of the Nations Nations . 
because we we survived to a well sad history . 
we take our place , we the reprenons , we must succeed to restore the former partnerships . 
he not there has not to qualify the qualify . 
how of drain , of intelligences , of commissions , of consultation , of committees special , of research that will he ? 
during the 50 last years , I believe well that all has been said . 
rest to create , to most excursions the process historic who we will ceased collectively and dignement . 
the Nations Nations must the allowed . 
the process is irréversible . 
for grow of way stand , he must of the territory and of the resources , he we must a place to we in this country . 
he we must avertir , open the spirit , help to the implementation in place of this who not there not still , promote the creativity , the Innovation policy , the return of the responsibility , of the self and of the dignity . 
I wish to this that the Canada the example , I not the not to this that he the dégrade . 
the Nations Nations must the with of they - same with a treasury who not is not today , with of the rights affirmés , with of the resources , with a Senators in the Affairs national . 
we we a Coast enormous to back . 
he is impossible that . we refuses the right real of do we - same this that human not can do to our place .

the Board of specifications of the Environment for the children 
Adopted of the motion of to 
the hon. Mira Spivak , pursuant to the notice 2 November 99 , move : 
that the Senate urge the government to tough a office of specifications of the Environment for the children , be a body stand responsible of promote the protection of the children against the risk environmental . 
the senators who have sat to the committee on the bill of bill C - 32 and who have heard the representatives of the Institute Canadian of the health act regarding the to of this office are a great part of my reaching . 
the first of these reasons , and who is certainly enough , is that we we angry need of this office of specifications of the Environment for the children . 
the children are more RCMP by the polluants environmental . 
, the committee , . we has explained why , in words scientific , and he worth the only of the repeat because this is the key of all the rest . 
during the six first months of his life , a bébé ingère seven time more of water by kilogramme of negative that a adulthood . 
a child of a to five years mange three to four time more of foods , by kilogramme of negative , that a adulthood . 
a bébé endormi based a volume of air two time more important that not the fact a adulthood to the repos . 
all that means that the water , the air or the foods pollués have a impact many more dismantling on a child that on you . 
this impact it sometimes of the séquelles for any the life ; he is sometimes irréversible . 
when the bébé the find still in the body of his mother , or when he is nursed to the within and that the body of his mother is pollué , a low amount of nerve are to the bad time can lead the lack , the surdité , a crisis cérébrale or a prohibits independent . 
, the over of the last decades , the scientific have could the see in the framework of the studies which with of children presentations to the plomb or which the mothers had consumed of the fish pollué to the wastes from of the Lakes Lakes or still with of children Regarding in of the communities victims of poisoning to the méthylmercure . 
this months - this , the Centre for Health and Environment and Justice of the States - United has released a amount important of new data on the effects of a pollutants are Unleash , the dioxine . 
the over the more encroachment of this report , this is that the dioxine frequently found in the foods enough for entraver the growth and the development of the children . 
the beef haché contains normally 1.5 parties of dioxine by trillion , the cheese persillé milligrams parties and a pilon of chicken or a morceau of aiglefin 0,03 parties by trillion . 
the nourrissons absorbent each day a amount of dioxine many more way that the adults . 
the reason , this is that the dioxine the so in the milk maternel . 
according some studies , the babies nourris to the within to the Canada absorbent 26 parties by trillion of dioxine , be about 30 per of more that the babies to the States - United , more of the double of this that absorbent the babies in Russia and more of eight time this that absorbent the babies in Thailand . 
I not in know not the reason . 
what are exactly the effects of the dioxine on the children ? 
. has established a link between the exposure to the dioxine before the birth and a more low quotient a , a behaviour renfermé or dépressif , the hyperactivité , and a system immunitaire more low . 
the dioxine has a effect so powerful that . has also observers that she had a effect on the per of the sexes . 
the report contains of the workplace of recommendations for prevent the malaise future . 
he suggestion , by example , to the place of brûler the ordures , the key source of dioxine , of do of the Retraining intensif , of reduce the PCB and of to in place of best measures of protection of the Environment . 
a other suggestion , this is of stop of brûler the PCB medical and dangerous , of eliminate phase the Contents plastiques who are a other source important of dioxine , or of deals the pesticides tainted to the dioxine . 
we we the choice . 
of the children have paid sir for that we acquérions the knowledge " lead to the prevention , but human not can say to the government how apply these knowledge . 
this is a service which the encountered a office of specifications of the Environment for the children . 
he définirait the present bloc of the knowledge and collaborerait with of other departments and agencies of the government for that . é the of these knowledge on the children in the development of the regulations . 
without this office , the rate of pollution tolérables continue presumably of be under in the purpose of protect the men adults layout , and not the women and the children . 
however , this not is that that a part of this who only the implementation in place of the office . 
we we also need of the office for lead the research on of the questions troublantes which we not we not still found of good answers . 
why the number of the children asthmatiques has he quadruplé since few decades ? 
a office of specifications of the Environment for the children could promote this kind of research , as could the do the centres of excellence for the well - be of the children . 
he there has more of two years and half , the government has promised of money 20 million of $ on five years to the research on the health of the children who would done by the new centres of excellence . 
a Hamani of months have past , but nothing not has been fact . 
I hope that the government instead the implementation on at of these centres and the tighten on of other recommendations included in the speech of the Throne . 
this is to only if we we the of the health of the children when we envisageons of the Estimates , of the regulations or a policy . 
we not know same not what Contents dumping the find usually in our reacts of games , our garderies and our schools . 
we not we not of lines guidelines to to reduce the exposure of the children to of the Contents dumping that where they just the more clear of their time . 
he there has of other duties that could assume a office of specifications of the Environment for the children . 
second , we should support this motion for do in so that our country respect the commitments that he has taken in remedied the statement of 1998 that the leaders of the G - 8 have made on the health of the children and the Environment and in banning the Convention of 1991 Current to the rights of the child . 
for respect these commitments , he must a leadership policy , a leadership as the which we we been witnesses to the States - United . , little close to the same time where our leaders promettaient to their constituents all they of measures for the children , the chairman Clinton has ordered to all the agencies federal of determine of way priority the risk for the security and the specifications Environmental may of have of the impact " on the children and of amend the political , the programs , the activities and the standards in because for correct this imbalance . 
little after , laU.S. Environmental Mammals Agency has created the office of specifications of the Environment for the children to of the conform to the ask of the chairman , and the body has announced the implementation in place of a program in 1995 - a program national to to protect the health of the children against the risk environmental . 
. not knows not clear what share of the changes he must credit to the office and to the programs the in place by the EPA . 
this that the . knows however , this is that laU.S. Grains Quality Mammals Act require now the reassessment of the levels of tolerance regarding close of 10 $ pesticides , that the new standard atmosphérique linked to the ozone should the lower each year by a million of case of shortened pulmonaires of least home the children and that the EPA ask to the staff of take in consideration the new - Regarding , the children and the women repatriated when she establishes the standards provisions to the water terrifying . 
if , however , we we concentrons on the more vulnerable of between we , to know the children in growth , we will all a better opportunity of be protected . 
I know that the office proposed has has the enthusiasm of the senators of in opposite when he in has been question to the committee . 
I hope do that the interest of some of between them not the is not démenti and that these senators may to the debate and convaincront their colleagues of support this motion . 
the the the Speaker : 
pleasure - he to the senators of adopt the motion ?

the sitting is met to 14 p.m. , the Speaker the to the Chair . 
prayers . 
the business of the Senate 
the the the Speaker : 
I be replaced to the Chair by the new Speaker good tempore , the senator Cool - Cool , that I commend for his appointment to this position . 
the hon. John B . Stewart 
tributes to the opportunity of the departure to the retirement 
the hon. B . Alasdair Graham : 
honourable senators , the first time that I I met the senator John B . Stewart , he there has of many years , he was already very respected in the as academic for have fact of the studies of Prime graduate to the University Acadia and of the studies higher to the University Columbia to New York , and that for have been successivement professor of Science political and steering of the département of Science political to the college Barnard of New York . 
John has been associated to the Foundation Rockefeller until to the return in Nova - Nova , in 1959 , where he is was to the département of Science political of the St. Francis Xavier . 
about three years more later , the professor Stewart was elected member for the riding of Antigonish - Guysborough . 
he was elected in 1963 and in 1965 . 
these events are part of my best fond political . 
after the éclatante victory remportée by Diefenbaker in 1958 , the Association Liberal of the Cork of Antigonish - Guysborough has decided that we we we to in soon of a candidate who be the more dignified of faith that possible . 
each time that he there had a discussion , someone a the enquérait to the about of this new professor , John Stewart , to - as they the appelaient sometimes -St. FX . 
who would enough of influence and of credibility , in fact , of courage for the call ? 
he has fact in so that the professor Stewart the find in the office in the former wing on the campuses of the quoted university , by a Saturday last orageux . 
the telephone " : 
Allô ? 
professor Stewart ? 
here Lester Pearson . 
and the rest , this is of the history ! 
a small Previous to comments of this anecdote : the senators the recall Mr. Pearson was fanatique of sports and that he followed regularly the matches of hockey Canadian diffusés to the television , the Saturday last . 
the call to the professor Stewart erroneous of Stornoway and has had place between the first and the second period of the match origins the Canadians of Montreal to the Maple Leafs of Toronto . 
the senator Mahovlich : 
who earned ? 
the senator Graham : 
if I me in recall well , Frank was the third star this last - that . 
during the six years that he has fellow to the House of the Commons , John Stewart the is revealed the student the more hard of the system Parliamentary that he me that been given of know , the distinguant , as he the has fact any his life during , by the work seriously , succeeds essentially for the more great well of his province of origin and of the country . 
each of his over was archi - comble . 
someone a has already said that the influence of a enseignant or of a teacher the ( for always . 
he or she not knows never where the limit this influence . 
in the case of the professor Stewart , who has the reputation légendaire of form of the people who get of the scholarships of the Foundation Rhodes , this influence has indeed been enormous . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
they would can - be fact someone something of well ! 
the senator Graham : 
fortunately , the professor Stewart is came that to time for take in with and orienter the Prime Minister of the New - Brunswick , Frank McKenna . 
the professor Stewart has also persistent of the thoughts to the about of the experience Parliamentary and released two literature by authority and posing by a broader public regarding the process Parliamentary . cases a of his literature precedents entitled : 
Political and Moral Thought of David Hume , the professor Stewart has shown his concern Increase to the regard of the touchstone moral of the policy democratic . 
he has including quoted a a of the work such of this philosopher écossais who is considered as a of the pioneers of the Science political : 
of all the men who the distinguent through to their accomplishments crash , the place of honour seems to to the legislators who transmettent a system of laws and of the institutions to to ensure the peace , the happiness and the freedom to the generations future . 
Hume has fully of the generations of parliamentarians in become , all these representatives of the people binge and field who had including that the reason of be of a good government is of including of the laws and of the institutions based on the justice . 
of fact , the senator John Stewart was become to the over of his long career Parliamentary the quintessence same of the législateur course and conscientious imaginé by David Hume several centuries before : a législateur who on whether this who is fair ; a législateur who saisit the importance of the resolute in the creation and the protection of our society free ; a législateur to to heart the well public ; a législateur who not it nothing to the accident ; a man who has country a spirit great and a energy his to the service of his community , of the students , of his province and of the country ; a patriot thought who has always including , as the to the old adage , that those who the waiting to récolter the result of the freedom must in pay the price . 
the deep sense of the service of John Stewart the has led to to a energy incredible in the committees , that this be in the committee of the fisheries or in the of the Banking or still in his service important and very , of chairman of the committee of the Affairs foreign , in Work with jurisdiction and expeditiously all the questions complex who made of the Position respected of the Canada on the scene World . 
he there has a little more of a century , the such CanadienEdward Blake has spoke of manner simple of the means of the Parliament to the House . 
he has said : 
the privileges of the Parliament are the privileges of the people . 
the rights of the Parliament are the rights of the people . 
these words , honourable senators , have been the in of the life and of the time an of the senator John Stewart . 
the rights and the privileges of the Parliament taking their source in the rights of our people - in the privileges , in the wisdom and in the humanity of our people . 
to had the great privilege of have John Stewart for mentor and to been for him a colleague and a friend during of many years , I am proud of say that a place of honour particular and well deserved up to this législateur learned and an , this course and he servant of the people and this enseignant drama who has left his in indélébile and linear in the history . 
yes , a place of honour particular up to the senator John Stewart , who will angry be to the over of the days and of the years to come to good number of between we who are to the service of our wonderful country . 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I not I not led of inquiry specific with of the honourable senators , but I believe that the senator Graham and me - same know the senator Stewart since more long that anyone of other to the Senate . 
in all case , we we are met for the first time he there has 40 years . 
that me give , me seems he , a sure right and a some jurisdiction for speak of him . 
in 1959 , be few years after have from my had of the St. Francis Xavier , I I led the office of the graduates to Antigonish . 
this fall - that , the professeurJohn B . Stewart is income in the province and the Cork where he is unborn after have left the position of enseignant - which has spoke the senator Graham - to the University Columbia and his service of counsel to the Rockefeller Honorary to of with of the duties of professor of Science political to the St. Francis Xavier . 
each day of class by the the , the professor Stewart and me we dîné together to the same table , in the Room to eat of the their of the St. FX . 
in this who was to the time the St. of the saints , John Stewart and me were two foreign - him , a protestant , and me , a Progressive - Conservative . 
fortunately for John Stewart , this was also the time where the movement oecuménique saw the day under the direction of the Pope Jean XXIII . 
the their tendaient the with of the lively , of the friendship and of the cultivate to those that they appelaient " our brothers planners " , which John Stewart was part . 
unfortunately , he has was a little more of time to the révérends Fathers for the take of sympathy for the Progressive - Conservatives . 
what that he in be , to few opportunities to the Senate these last years , sometimes to of the times rather tendus of our debates , I I already said that I not know no other professor of the St. FX or of , who that inspired to his students as of respect and of admiration that John Stewart . 
as the senator Graham the has said , he is true that I not I not been to proprement speak a student of John Stewart , but as well of other , I I been the student here , to this place . 
, the opportunity , in the framework of the debates , he averted my performance . 
I not I never from better that a C of among in his Evaluations . 
of any way , I not can explain by experience why he from of a if high believe of the share of his students . 
I think that . can be to little close sure that he not anyone not the popularity in the pliant to the requirements of the culture adolescente , as the are some upon . 
, my notice , he is more likely that he earned their respect because that he the comply him - same for their intellect and their judgment and because that he drawing of the criteria of excellence high - not of the criteria inatteignables , but of the criteria high - and that he knew from the better of his students . 
you find of the men and of the women who , well of the years more later , say that the point grand of their life of student has been the fact of have could côtoyer John Stewart . 
. me has said that a sure number of between them the are made he there has few weeks to the St. FX for participate to a colloquium particular and to a tribute to their former professor . 
I am sure that he has should be very moved of their presence and of their evidence of respect and of believe . 
is a university who the is frayé a move in policy . 
I like say few words on the election of 1962 . 
however , this was a great victory pourJohn Stewart . 
he has ramené the party of very far , the the of the peerage of in which the candidate precedent , Al Graham , the had left . 
the senator Graham : 
I had avoided that . 
the senator Murray : 
the senator Stewart is can - be a university who has avid in policy , but he not has never shown the détachement proverbial of the academic to the regard of the events political . 
all of first , nothing of this who is came in his riding or to the about not him has never escaped . 
few years after the time where we mangions together all the midis to Antigonish , I was here to as of Deputy first in the government Diefenbaker when he is came as member newly elected of Antigonish - Guysborough . 
I me recall of a series of télégrammes separatists that I I received in report with a some parcelle of ground that the government had achetée or not had not achetée in the city of Antigonish for there build a new building federal . 
no grief not was thought , particularly when the Conservatives were to the power . 
this is a expert of the questions Constitutional and procédurières and he has been chairman of our committee of the Affairs foreign , but this which I me remind the better of the years that I I fellow to receive the questions , this are all these concerns that had the senator Stewart for the fisheries in Nova - Nova , for the impact on the Nova - Nova of the policy federal in the of highways , for the construction of a bridge Work to the Island - Edward - Prince - Edward or for the impact of the GST on all the Canadians . 
can - . say that this university is drove of the spirit of party ? 
I not I that a something to say . 
as he the has often repeatedly , we fundamentally a sport of team , and to this chapter , I must by that he achiever . 
the senator Graham has spoke of the two literature that the senator Stewart has published on the philosopher écossais David Hume , the Prime the entitled : 
the Moral and Political Philosophy of David Hume , and the second Opinion and Reform in Hume' s Political Philosophy . 
honourable senators , I not I not read these books . 
in 1761 , the Church Catholic has put all the literature of Hume to the spoken and I there therefore , by extension , that the books writing on him by John Stewart have or the same fate . 
. not cannot be too prudent in of the case of this kind . 
I consider that the shut of read the books written by David Hume or to the about is the a of the measures the least distressing cut by the Church Catholic . 
far of duty be to the spoken of anyone , he mériterait of be read by all the parliamentarians - but particularly those of the other place . 
all the world knows that our colleagues of the other place not are not of great readers and that their face of attention not today not the of the oiseau - time , but I the encourage to read the chapter 1 . 
they there liquidity finally a description . not can more limpide of the House of the Commons - and of the Parliament all world , same if the professor Stewart not refers not wording the Senate . 
they there would , as I the I said the other day in a other context , to the do remind their prerogatives , and lireJohn Stewart their would great well to this regard . 
with the departure of the senator Stewart , we lose a of our best parliamentarians and the Nova - Nova , a representative sanity carefully and very appropriate . 
if the government to him offer a ride and a office in the parages , I not there see not of generates . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the senator Murray : 
after all , if the senator Grafstein can the allow of what the former senator MacEachen of " treasury national " , we can to fair as see in the senator Stewart a valuable resources not registration . 
is why , Honour the , the time come , I be all prepared to present a proposal , seconded by the senator Lynch - Lynch , who in has had the idea , to that the office he we by the former senator MacEachen be the to perpétuité to the clause of the former senator Stewart . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the the the Speaker : 
must - I understand , hon. senator Murray , that you proposez a motion ? 
the senator Murray : 
with the leave of the Senate . 
the the the Speaker : 
is - this of agreed , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I me find me - same in a Chair who me authority the honour of be the next orator . 
this is a real honour . 
this is for me a great happy of to tribute to my colleague , the hon. senator Stewart . 
all in listening carefully the other speakers , he me is come to the spirit that the senator Stewart has a side fantasque and humourous that he we has revealed to the dinner that we we organized in the honour when , by example , he has spoke of the day where he was was in the Room of the Senate and had treaty the senator Murray of tyran and the Speaker of usurpateur - by mistake , of after this that I the I heard say . 
my remember the more sir of the senator Stewart not just not of here , but rather of my only visit to Antigonish , where I was went attend to the conference MacEachen . 
the senator Stewart has had the kindness of me explain the importance that had the university where he had unequal , St. Francis Xavier , and the mystery that constituency for me all these people who circulaient in to to the doigt a chevalière ornée of a X , of the people who were of the associated to my s of lawyers and that I had the Appendix of see across in my city , Calgary . 
I know now of where they come . 
I in am came to s their training and the opportunity who seems the follow since their exit St. Francis Xavier . 
with of the upon of the trempe of the senator Stewart , the quality of their training was something some . 
the senator Stewart has played a role remarkable here . 
I like me also mention a of his literature . 
I not I not read Hume and , as the senator Murray , I not I not the intention of the do , but not for the same reasons rigides for which the senator Murray the refuses to read Hume . 
the is : 
the leaders of the parties to the House in are the heroes overlooked . 
each of them must have a double loyalty : to the party and to the House . 
good number of their ennuis come of the fact that their colleagues not the soucient not of the House or the there interested many too . 
sometimes , they not held not the of the House . 
sometimes also they him overwhelmingly too of importance , of so that all the concessions made to their Provincial for in facilitate the business just for of Sternly capitulations . 
listen well , senator Boudreau . 
he add : 
little any the conflict who " between ambitions and opinions , the leaders of the House must ensure the operating of the system . 
I in am became extremely aware , then that I not the was not to my arrived to the Senate . 
this who is all to the honour , in as that university and politician , the senator Stewart we has all prodigué this education . 
if only we were all prepared to the hear ! 
I you hear now , senator Stewart . 
all to the long of the mandate , the senator Stewart has been a great Leader . 
he has including sat with distinction to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
my experience in this area the limited , I can now have a idea of the difficulty of this task . 
on the Hill of the Parliament , the senator Stewart has a sure number of students , and I me hasten of add , honourable senators , that we are all of the students of John Stewart . 
we the respect as professor because , to of many opportunities , we we learned of him and we followed his Aristotle to the over of our deliberations . 
senator Stewart , I believe that the more great tribute that this House can to to a senator , this is of him express the deep respect . 
your contribution we will ; however , you we let to all a legs asset and particularly of the principles very important for we guide . 
that your retirement be full of new experience , of beautiful books to read and to write , and of spirit to form . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the hon. Roch Bolduc : 
honourable senators , I I met John Stewart for the first time to the fall 1988 , when I I been appointed to the Senate . 
during five years , we we sat together to the committee of the Finance national and during the 11 last years , we we all two fact part of the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
we we of other things in common : of the studies higher to the States - United , a position of university , a politics particular for the philosophical policy , and this that I appellerais a some service for the service public - John Stewart , in as that member and senator , and me , as official and senator . 
of other things we about . 
John is a English of origin bagpipe ; he is protestant , cold to the States - United all in the a Liberal College of Harvard , and a writer distinguished . 
I am French , Canadian French , Catholic , Conservative as the people of cardiology , friend of the States - United and former manager . 
I must say however that , to the over of the years , we we shared of many tasks which the analysis by program of the Estimates government , the study of the various aspects of the policy foreign of the Canada , and more particularly of his policy commercial in reason of the importance increased that has taken the trade international to the over of the last decade . 
course , as the has said the senator Murray , John was against the Agreement of free - Exchange . 
I i that this was because that he was then part of the Opposition and that he wanted defend this Position knowing that we défendrions the Position while and that , in last analysis , this would the Canadians who trigger . 
that could also be because that he people that the ALE not was not also good for we that the Covenant of the no , who just of be against by the Organization World of the trade . 
what that he in be , this was the opportunity of sharpest debates to the Senate , comparable to the on the GST , but many more civilized that this last , I must the say . 
, the committee of the Finance national , we we covered of many issues , in particular the various aspects of the policy administrative government . 
our study of the recommendation Royal me has left of the fond impérissables . 
our savant colleague , John Stewart , expert of the procedure Parliamentary , on which he has released a book in 1997 , he a malin happy to own of many witnesses in their the retranchements with his arguties legal . 
they me were think to the over métaphysiques of the 16 century between the jésuites and the thomistes , between other , Suarez . 
, comments of philosophical , I must you attention , honourable senators , that not only our colleague is Dr. in right public and in studies government , but that he has also a control in Science policy and that he is a expert internationalement recognized of David Hume . 
he has released two literature on the writing of Hume . 
I can you say that , after have read the biography of Hume , I I taken conscience of many there between John and this great author écossais : the love of the books , the more , the attrait of the distances , a spirit sceptique but widest . 
I me say sometimes that he is the Montesquieu of the Nova - Nova . 
the heroes was a good friend of ; Smith , well that I not think not that John that in also high believe that me . 
back - in to David Hume . 
he the is of a publication semestrielle that the as of the philosophical university feel greatly . 
in this group auguste of brilliant academic , I must you say that our colleague is considered as a great priest . 
in November 1995 , we we had right to a analysis criticism of the second thing on Hume . 
John has defended with gracefully his applicable that that Hume be the precursor of the tradition Liberal British and not of the tradition conservatrice . 
the a of his criticism , Douglas Plain , has wrote : 
John B . Stewart the is revealed be a time of more a one of the foundation Hume seriously , calculated and sensitive . 
I me incline before a such variety of talents or " who allows to our senator of to of the theory policy to the practice policy . 
after all , he has been elected three time and and , he not is not simply a excellent spirit there , but a historian appropriate of the the centuries of the life policy British . 
in as that chairman of the committee of the Affairs foreign , he has known do lead our studies of questions important who have given place to of many proposals appropriate , according we , for this who is of guide the questions international of our country . 
our last report on the impact of the Union European on the Canada , who was the to the that we had happened he there has few years , is a excellent example of that . 
the next report that he has led to as of chairman , on the NATO and the Canada , should also duties of pride all the senators opposite - to - opposite of the work of this committee . 
during any his career policy , John has fought for the interests legitimate of the people of the Maritimes . 
I hope that he will we leave for go live a nice retirement pleased , but I am sure that he not has not still wrote the last book . 
I him wish a life prosperous through to his rights of author , all as the famous predecessor British . 
the hon. Marie - P . 
Poulin : 
honourable senators , to the over of the 132 years who the are period since the Confederation , of many distinguished Canadians have sat in this chamber . 
their knowledge , their wisdom , their perception and their coolness have contributed widely to the good conduct of the Affairs of our country . 
we know that we we among we a Canadian extremely respected , the senator John B . Stewart , who can in any legitimacy the join to the panthéon of these great géants of the Senate that are the honourable Eugene Forsey , Raoul Dandurand , Denise McQueen Fergusson , an Wilson , Chubby Power , Duff Duff and Arthur Meighen . 
they have all made a contribution all to fact remarkable , as all historian or observer of the Senate can in testify . 
the contribution of the senator Stewart since his appointment to the Senate he there has 15 years will been the spirit pénétrant and his extensive knowledge , who him will spent a reputation uncommon among his colleagues . 
this is a reputation who has débordé the does of this chamber for the répandre until in the centres of decision of the country where his views on the Affairs foreign , the Banking , the trade and the fisheries have of the negative . 
and as the know all those who have been engaged in a debate with him , his very great eloquence is a weapon beware . 
the senator Stewart not is no brought to the overstating or to the grandiloquence . 
this is a learned , a man dignified and grows , a " an man " as . said already . 
his views are always équilibrées , a quality of uniqueness who is very appréciée home the who give the opinion , and I I had the privilege of the see often . 
this politician , professor and writer has fact honour to our institution . 
this is a loss for we and for the country that the time be come for him of leave the Senate . 
his ideas and the action we miss enormous , and that his good advice . 
I wish to our friend all this that he there has of better in this new step of his life . 
the hon. Norman K . Atkins : 
the week next , we retirees tribute to the senator Derek Lewis , also of the Canada Atlantic . 
same if we we and the opportunity of do point their accomplishments , as to the Senate that , , we are tristes to the idea that all the two quitteront the Senate in the next days . 
this is a loss real , as for we who remain that for the Senate in as that institution Parliamentary . 
in participant to the committees and to the business of the Senate , these two senators have always succeeded to and the their of the debate , in Dolly to the questions to the study the perception and the wisdom learning to the long of their careers different . 
we him are our best best for his retirement . 
as to the senator John Stewart , who has represented to the House of the Commons the riding of Antigonish - Guysborough , in Nova - Nova , he is the only capita of the Nova - Nova who knows where the find Cook' s , , where is unborn my great - father . 
this is a banlieue of Guysborough . 
the senator Stewart is a university , a author and a expert of the parliamentary . 
before my arrived to the Senate , I knew the senator Stewart only of reputation , by his business to the House of the Commons and by those who dictatorial his business academic . 
but , when I am became member of the committee Senate of the Affairs foreign , I I been resolved of admiration before his knowledge and the with in as that chairman of the committee . 
those who have trend to demean our institutions government would interest to study the work of the senator Stewart as here that to the other place . 
he has always considered as very important the role of the Parliament in the society Canadian , all as he was for essential the process parliamentarians , the role of a Opposition raisonnée and the held of good debates . 
and this was the case little any who had the speak if the comments that he entendait were endowment . 
that the said , he not has never dérogé to the discipline of party , this who fact of him a good Liberal . 
in addition , he not has almost never missed a sitting since his appointment . 
the senator Stewart he his responsibilities very to the seriously . 
this will difficult of not more the see in opposite of me and of having his long during that of the points , good and bad , will raised in this room . 
the hon. Joyce Fairbairn : 
honourable senators , today today , we say Adieu to the a of the parliamentarians the more distinguished and the more dedicated that I my had the honour of know since 37 years . 
as he has been agreed today today , the Senate perdra the a of his members the more outstanding when the senator John Stewart will his retirement tomorrow . 
for we , of this side - this of the chamber , he is well close of be irremplaçable . 
the senator Stewart has spent his life to the learning , to the education and to the service public in his province , the Nova - Nova , and including to the St. Francis Xavier , in his nice city proud of Antigonish . 
he has been a partisan and the conscience of the Party Liberal of the Nova - Nova and of the Party Liberal of the Canada . 
he is was in policy federal in 1962 in quality of member Liberal of Antigonish - Guysborough , position that he has he during three mandates . 
this is during this period - I was then a young journalist Parliamentary - that I the I known . 
the senator Stewart we has fact benefit of the expertise with wisdom and judgment . 
I know that the senators of this side - this the ennuieront seriously of his advice . 
this could well be a day there for the senator Stewart . 
the senator Murray him has offered a position perpétuel . 
however , I the urge to reflect seriously to this proposal because that he could probably do a small fortune in lone drafts in procedure Parliamentary . 
the leadership which he has fact evidence to the committee of the Affairs foreign has been " cool " and " an " , as say the young . 
the senator Stewart has had a great influence on many of between we . 
I I lived a time coast after the election of 1988 , when the senator Stewart me has asked if I wanted do part of the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
I I then thought that I had really succeeded . 
he me is then wished that I not devais serve that during the break of the illiteracy for that we can respect our commitment of adopt the Agreement of free - Exchange before the 1 January 1989 , to the case where our opposite - to - opposite déclencheraient of the election . 
what that he in be , this period has been rich and fertile . 
I in Custody a excellent remember . 
a time this chapter debated , I am manifestation to my duties normal to the Senate . 
he me rest still to be called as member of this committee mythique that is the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
I Custody hope of there , . 
I like me stop a moment to this that the senator Stewart has work to the within of this committee . 
, the over of a decade agitée by of the regroupements commercial international changeants , by of the perturbations financial and trade victimized in different regions of the world and to of the impact to the Canada and by a increase unfortunately too due of the number of the conflict military a , the senator Stewart has led the committee in of the studies offended and depth who have served to the making and to the leaders political of the Canada and of , , when they have had the intellect of read the reports or the in are given the only . 
he not fact no doubt that John Stewart the is you personally and with energy to define a Position realistic before our concern Increase for the peace in the context present who , as he the has said in a of his first interventions to the Senate , parliament sometimes to we lasser and to we accepting of continue of we fight for our because . 
then that he spoke in favour of the creation of the Institute Canadian for the peace and the security international , in June 1984 , he we has exhortés to " concerning the muskox of the at and of the cynicism " . 
he has décrié those who not parlaient that of the " problem of the peace " . 
in him saying to the bye today today , I like read a short addressed of the speech that he has given then , who encourage the Canadians to continue their efforts , each to his way , to of sauvegarder the optimism as to the peace World . 
is this that said John Stewart the 28 June 1984 in this House : 
as the said the old proverbe , he must have a resolute Increase for preserve the freedom . 
we must to on our not , replicating the same things , we supplying we - same and supplying the new generations to the as and to legislation that they come . 
this repetition not must not we do believe that we not accomplissions nothing . 
each day that the peace is unabated , we we work someone something and we must adopt of new practices to legislation that the situation changing . 
honourable senators , of the words of this kind are part of the heritage that we it John Stewart , as the work that he has work in this House , to the Parliament , for the Canada and for the world world . 
I am personally sad of the see from . 
this is a good friend since very long . 
the support effacing and constant , when I was Leader of the government to the Senate , was generous and well advised . 
I not would could accomplish this task without him . 
I him wish a good health and of the happiness then that he not to his province adorée and to Antigonish . 
John , going to speak and to write . 
you me missed , to me , to my husband Mike and to Bessie . 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , this is a real privilege of take the speak to the opportunity of the departure to the retirement of the senator Stewart . 
those who have known the senator Stewart many more long that me him have already the tribute . 
I like when same share some thoughts with my colleagues . 
however , this is also the senator Stewart who we has learned that the Parliament , this is more that of the speech éloquents , this is the ability of to between we , of we question of the questions , of in happen to of the consensus and of find of the land of agreement . 
I want the thank of me have unequal that he not there has not that my skills who rely , he there has also my ability of listen the other . 
in the interest national , we must attempt of find of the land of agreement . 
since my arrived to the Senate , I I had the honour of sit to the committee of the Affairs foreign and of in with the position of chairman - chairman . 
let - me of so , well piètrement I me in apologize , this that the senator Stewart has said to our committee . 
the most of the senators the this to the committee in that do point their own point of view . 
as he the said , of the senior of our own piédestal , we want all dominer , with our contemporaries , our ideas , our philosophical and our objectives . 
he responsibility to the chairman of find the way of meet all these elements disparates and of the convince of insist their efforts . 
the senator Stewart has certainly been in legislation of and this challenge to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
we not were not easy . 
we had all of the opinions well opinionated . 
the senator Stewart we has certainly all given the possible of take the speak and of do point our point of view . 
he had the more nice quality that a chairman can have : he was fair - fair to the regard of all the members of the committee , to the regard of the question and to the regard of the responsibilities of the Senate . 
he has made to the committee this that I chéris the more , to know a allure independent . 
about six months after my arrived here , then that I déployais any my eloquence on a point or on a other , a senator has fully that . not the concern not because that I was a independent . 
and that not the wanted not of the all a compliment . 
each time that I I taken the speak on a question , however , I I had the sentiment that the senator Stewart we encouraged to more of raffinement and of reflection in the study of the questions which we were before . 
he had the don of we remind to the order of time to other . 
more often that other , he had the don of we to to work a little better and a little more very to the committee . 
as the senator Bolduc the has said , our reports are éloquents . 
they have been internally by of the representatives of sectors important , sometimes by of the people of the government , sometimes by of the people of the governments of other country , and always by those who examining the questions of policy foreign . 
in the work , the senator Stewart the is always served of the charm and of the spirit and has always shown a desire sincere of do current the Affairs of the Senate . 
more often that other , when the other out the head , the senator Stewart was able of keep the at and of act in gentleman . 
the ability of keep the was and his civility and of ensure the good been of the process are the more great leaving that . can have . 
senator Stewart , I you thank for all your years to the head of the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
I you thank for the things that you we you enseignées . 
of other senators have spoke enough length of your abilities for the education , then I not me fellow not on this point . 
however , I sharing certainly their point of view . 
I hope that the senator Stewart continue of follow of close our work . 
I hope that he continue of the otherwise in the community university and the community policy and , particularly , I hope that he continue to own the Canadians to achieve the levels of curiosity and of excellence that he has achieved in this chamber . 
the hon. Peter A . Stollery : 
honourable senators , this is a time that I I appréhendé - the retirement of the senator John Stewart . 
I not knew not the senator Stewart before the arrived to the Senate , in 1984 . 
someone a has spoke of the respect of the senator Stewart for the leaders parliamentarians . 
I understand that . 
we we forgotten that , since 1984 , we we of the governments dispelled . 
the senator Stewart has been elected by a low majority in three Parliaments where the government was minority . 
I I also been elected in two Parliaments where the government was minority . 
in this would , . appreciate the responsibility of the Leader Parliamentary . 
I I always had a great admiration for the senator MacEachen and , when I I fact the knowledge of the senator Stewart , in 1984 , I am became a fervent fan of this last . 
he has made a contribution enormous to the committee of the Affairs foreign , which I am member since that we we " our hearings on the Agreement of free - Exchange , in 1986 . 
the committee the is met very frequently , and the senator Stewart in is became the chairman . 
he is all simply impossible of explain to what point the senator Stewart has had a impact on our committee . 
honourable senators , the senator Stewart is a wonderful professor . 
the people who the have known before me we the have said . 
however , me who I fact the knowledge of the senator Stewart here , to the Senate , I can now saying that he is , of the least to my " , the more great professor that he me that never been given of meet . 
he we has unequal how deal the Affairs public . 
he has of great fight and of great principles . 
of more in more , to legislation that we vieillissons all , we we interrogeons on the fight and the principles . 
when . meeting a human as the senator Stewart , the experience is very stimulante . 
he is can - be politologue , but he is also philosopher . 
this not is not a accident the he affectionne all particularly David Hume . 
he sharing the same values that him . 
he has fact a contribution incommensurable to our committee of the Affairs foreign , who has prepared of excellent reports under his Speaker . 
our challenge is now to maintain this level of excellence . 
the hon. Gerald J . Comeau : 
this was the first time that I votais to of the election federal . 
I not should not by for what party I I voted , but I think that the senator Stewart me pardonnera of have voted for Louis Comeau , who was candidate of the Party Progressive - Conservative to the time . 
in fact , I believe that the senator Stewart me has pardonné that in several opportunities . 
my purpose not was not of record a election held he there has 31 years , but of do know that I would well liked that we horses of a little more of time for dies the committee Senate Standing of the fisheries for be in legislation of deal that the speech of uttered that we take address to the senator Stewart , because he in has been a member very active . 
, the behalf of the members of the committee of the fisheries , I the thank of the way which he has contributed to the regulation of the issues complex on which we we had to we look to the over of the years . 
his magnificent capabilities of research , his knowledge depth and the know - do him have spent the respect of the members of the committee , of the witnesses and of the industry . 
when he the did of the case eliminated , the senator Stewart had the don of all streamline . 
he was always prepared to we do share of his binge advice . 
in my behalf staff and to the behalf of my colleagues , senator Stewart , I wish to say that you we missed . 
you you been for we all a very good professor . 
the hon. Anne C . Cools : 
honourable senators , for all these things who are honourable , them and about , I like do pale the words who have been speeches today today to the place of the senator John Stewart . 
my seat of Chair , the senator Watt , and me - same we been Connolly the same day , in January 1984 . 
this is to this opportunity that I I met the senator John Stewart . 
. can say that in biggest , we are upon all in same time . 
senator Stewart , I I read of your books . 
I I recently debated your last thing , the on David Hume . 
I must however by that the senator Stewart me in has offered a copy for the do forgive of have touch during three years a other thing that I him had came . 
in me appearing the book , he me has said that he not me would not pay of costs of gardiennage for the other . 
the senator Stewart has sat with me to different committees . 
I me recall particularly of the time where he had replaced provisoirement a colleague to a committee Special responsible of study the bill of bill C - 21 on the insurance - unemployment and where we had should we to to Canso , in Nova - Nova . 
he must say to the senator Murray and to the senators Conservatives of in opposite that in 1989 , during of this expenses particular in this region particular , we had rallié the opinion public and the media against this bill of bill . 
honourable senators , the Scotians - Scotians John Stewart , of origin bagpipe , and the senator Allan J . MacEachen , also Scotians - Scotians and of origin bagpipe , constituency to them two a presence with which he was be . 
during of the campaign of obstruction seeing in 1990 in this chamber to the about of the tax on the products and services , they have fact weigh on the senator Murray , Leader of the government , and a some other human of the Nova - Nova of origin bagpipe all the negative of the myriad that they constituency . 
honourable senators , Edward Blake what with of a great number for be the better of the lawyers to have sat to the Parliament Canadian , and Allan J . MacEachen , for be the better Parliamentary to have never served our country . 
I like add that John Stewart has been personally the more great learned and philosopher to have never served the Canada . 
the uniqueness because of his whose intellect , the or of the spirit , the knowledge that he had of the operating of the Parliament , of the principles and of the moral have for to the Party Liberal of extension this period very painful and sometimes has remember in the enough of the Opposition of 1984 to 1993 . 
I like thank the senator Stewart and him express of way poétique the affection and the respect special that I I for him . 
since you are Scotians - Scotians , senator Stewart , the " nice lady of Canso " , as me has called a time the senator MacEachen , you said : " Bon over Captain . " 
some of between we , honourable senators , we attended he there has few years to the conference MacEachen to the St. Francis Xavier , to Antigonish , and we had the opportunity of examine of close a institution where have been trained the more great of this country . 
I like for complete you read a or of the Bible which this school has fact his " . 
she is abdomen of the Épître to the Philippiens , chapter 4 , verset 8 : 
, the rest , brothers , that all this who is true , all this who is hon. , all this who is fair , all this who is rejection , all this who is kind , all this who deserves the approval , this who is vertueux and dignified of louange , be the subject of your thoughts . 
senator Stewart , I you wish a excellent retirement . 
I forward with forward your next book on David Hume . 
you quittez this place informed of our deep respect and of any our affection . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
I am came here he there has few weeks , to angry need of a mentor of the quality of the senator Stewart . 
he has been enough kind for me sponsor in this institution and the fact that he we leaving now , then that my education has to only began , will always for me a deep regret . 
I must you say that this not is not the first time that that me so . 
in 1962 , I am came to the St. Francis Xavier , to Antigonish , anxious of study the philosophical and the Science political and will without too there believe power become a student of John Stewart , the professor , a little as he there has few weeks . 
unfortunately for me , little of time after my arrived to the university , he is party for and the challenge of the life policy and lead a career all to fact proceed . 
, this time - that , I I lost the opportunity of follow the Aristotle of a petty . 
honourable senators , I say that for a reason . 
the senator Stewart cannot that , in the culture and the tradition écossaises , the présages are part of the beliefs . 
this are of the things who annoncent the events to come . 
my arrived to the St. Francis Xavier in 1962 has been the sign , for the senator Stewart , of the beginning of a new and proceed career , unfortunately for me . 
I am sure that my arrived to the Senate , he there has few weeks , présage still a time a career new , Mentorship , important and proceed for him . 
the hon. Catherine S . Callbeck : 
honourable senators , I like me join to my colleagues for to tribute to the hon. senator John Stewart . 
I wish to out that I sharing of all heart the feelings who have been if eloquently views by good number of our colleagues this after - afternoon . 
I not add that few words . 
the senator John Stewart has of the links very strong with the Island - Edward - Prince - Edward . 
the father is unborn in my province and a good part of his family there ahead always . 
well that the senator Stewart not there be not unborn him - same , he there has lived during five years and I the consider therefore as a resident of the Island . 
the home Stewart of the move Keppoch , close of Charlottetown , is now the ownership of the Dr. Colin McMillan , the brother of the hon. Tom McMillan , who has fact part of the cabinet of Brian Mulroney . 
from me - same of the region Atlantic of the Canada , I must say that I am very sad of see the senator Stewart we leave . 
the experience , his knowledge in of many areas and the commitment opposite to the Canada Atlantic we miss certainly many . 
since my arrived to the Senate , he there has two years , I I often asked of the assistance and of the advice to the senator Stewart . 
I like the thank publicly today today for all this that he has fact for me . 
as someone a the has underlined here this after - afternoon , the senator Stewart has left his in in this place and his presence and his interventions we miss enormous . 
however , I am sure that he continue of work for the better - be of all the Canadians . 
senator Stewart , I you greetings my best wishes to the opportunity of your retirement . 
the hon. Léonce MLA : 
during of the be , the other last , to the into of the Senate , of the price fabuleux and very ones of , have been distributed . 
my three colleagues , the senators Bacon , Ferretti Ferretti and Maheu , were guarding to my table . 
they regardaient of time to other the senator Stewart . 
I their I asked : " that is - this that you you to the look ? " 
they me have said : «M. MLA , the senator Stewart has the air more young that you . " 
I am therefore indisposé for in speak . 
I believe , honourable senators , that he would change a little the way of do the things to the opportunity of the departure of a senator . 
you not you not said still the better of this man . 
that not has not of sense , this that you what . 
I I a list of things that I will you say , of the these , not of the inventions . 
that fact three years that I the know . 
for conclusion these tributes well mérités today today , the who we leaving could propose the adjournment for that all the world parte in same time . 
that will be difficult of the retremper knew . 
. in the nostalgia . 
. not has not the time of the say that a such has well spoke . 
its the Gallery speech , . so to the period of the questions . 
not you - you not thought that if the senator Stewart the in will , I Dad a vote ? 
. should try of change our way of do for illustrious of manner important the departure of someone a . 
when I at the small school and that the inspecteur had we visit , he we give break . 
. could do the same something to the Senate . 
this that we we to the order of the day can expect to tomorrow or to Monday . 
we not we nothing of terrible to hear today today , to least of me hear speak . 
not oubliez not , senator Stewart , of ask the adjournment . 
I finish forget of the things tremendous who me fascinent . 
you you forgotten , honourable senators , of say that this man has demonstrated the qualities necessary for be senator , that he was a man gracious in his discussions and course as chairman of committee . 
he has fact opposite to of many challenges with distinction and in 3.2 a great sense of the responsibilities . 
as senator , he has helped to establish the reputation fault of the Senate . 
this man has dismantling the Senate as of other people the marqueront in the future . 
during the three years to the over made I I had the opportunity of work with him , I I could appreciate his qualities of honesty , of sincerity and of respect to the other . 
in his life personal as in his life professional , he has known gain the respect and the admiration of his colleagues and of his knowledge . 
the senator Stewart in of after the précepte " Nobody am not to them this that you not like not that . your the to your - same . " 
is a excellent rule of life . 
finally , on a note personal , I like congratulate the senator of a something which of other could surely testify , to know the wonderful sense of the elegant , and I like that he me give the behalf of the tailleur before that he we leaving . 
I know that I about to the behalf of all in saying that the Senate of the Canada loses today today a excellent representative . 
his perception and his wisdom we miss . 
I you wish all the happiness possible . 
the hon. John B . Stewart : 
honourable senators , as the senator Graham the has said , in 1962 , . me has guest to consider to obtain the nomination Liberal in the riding federal of Antigonish - Guysborough . 
I not knew not how respond . 
the member Progressive - Conservative of the time , , O Leary , who became more later a member of our hon. House , was very esteemed . 
of more , to side of the equipment policy of Stanfield , the " Big Blue Machine " of the Ontario had the air rather dépassée . 
my opportunity of gain were very low . 
finally , I I yielding to the resist . 
I I justified my decision in me saying that in as that professor of Science political , he was of my duty of me start in this campaign as if I was a work of research university . 
in end of the , I fus elected with a majority of 113 Senators . 
I crunch a great part of my success - many more that these 113 Senators - to the work of Alasdair Graham . 
I I then succeeded to me do elected in 1963 and in 1965 . 
the spent of the card election before the election of 1968 has had for effect of fusionner the major part of the riding of Antigonish - Guysborough with the of Allan MacEachen . 
I am therefore went they my opportunity in the riding of South West Scotia . 
contrary to this who the was in the major part of the rest of the Canada , the Scotians - Scotians not were not Act by the Trudeaumanie during of these election . 
still a time , we , the Liberal , were the fight Mr. Stanfield , the Leader of the time of the Party Progressive - Conservative . 
Allan MacEachen was the only Liberal elected in our province . 
after my defeat in South West Scotia , I am business place to the St. Francis Xavier . 
since this was for me a business independent , I should speak a little of the results of my research . 
that I - I learned to the House of the Commons ? 
of first , I I learned to know the people of Antigonish and of Guysborough and I I learned many of things to the about of their wharves , of their brise - lames and , particularly , of the simultaneously need of complete the business of dragage before the beginning of the season of the lobster earlier the spring . 
second , I I learned what were the problems economic of the west of the Canada . 
in January 1984 , I I been appointed to the Senate . 
that I - I learned to the Senate ? 
of first , I I learning a new respect for this House . 
this not is not of the all a " club of the old " , as the argue some upon and some journalists . 
second , I I learned that the Senate can do a work legislative very important . 
well of the members of the other place have little of time to spend to the bills of laws not controversés or think technical , and this is understandable . 
by therefore , the work of the Senate complete the of the House of the Commons . 
third , I I discovered the true value of the work of the committees . 
the simple says of the work of the committees me fact think to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign . 
the senators fact often the importance of the reports of the committees ; however , I believe that we effectively too little of attention to some of these reports in this House . 
by example , our report on the Canada in Asia - Pacific has attention many of attention to the pushing and well little to the Senate same . 
I hope that our report on the Europe awaited a debate here . 
the second report , on the Canada and the keeping of the peace , should be prepared of here few weeks . 
in this case , I am course that you discuterez firmly of the constations and of the recommendations of the committee . 
in fact , I hope that the report of the committee you provoquera enough for an a such debate . 
I wish to thank the committee of the Banking and of the trade , and particularly the senator Kirby , for all this that I I learned to as of member of this committee . 
he in will of same for the committee of the fisheries , chaired by the senator Comeau . 
he there in has many of other to thank . 
I refers Irene Duy , who has been my Secretary during almost all my years to the Senate . 
no task not was never too difficult for she . 
I am happy of the see with the husband to the gallery this after - afternoon . 
David by has been my Researcher . 
his knowledge and the work hard me have been indispensable , particularly in the framework of the business of the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
David Raynor , who is professor to the University of Ottawa and a parent of our former colleague Heath Macquarrie , not has up of me remind all this that must to David Hume and ; Smith the political modern . 
I wish to you say that I I began in the years 80 to write a book on ; Smith and that I I avid to a second book on David Hume . 
the links are if friends between these two authors ! 
Smith the is seconded directly on the basis jetées by the predecessor little more old . 
as . the has said without overstating in the before - comments of the report that I I presented yesterday , the committee the is many fié on the jurisdiction of Peter Berg , our Researcher . 
in the case of the report on the keeping of the peace , Wolfgang Koerner not has not physically his efforts in trying with many of success of the to to the aware of all the new on the Kosovo , the Defence European , the NATO and the Nations Nations . 
this reference , proposed by the senator Lynch - Lynch , the is disinfection be all to fact timely . 
David Goetz we has drafting with his research outstanding on two questions : of a share , the intervention of the NATO in Yugoslavia without mandate of the Nations Nations and of other share , the role that the Parliament should play when the Canada at to of the missions of keeping of the peace . 
three table have served the committee to the over of the last years . 
I about of Serge Pelletier , Line Gravel and Till Heyde . 
here and to the abroad , they have been our Pilots issue and shrewd . 
all the people who have worked around of the Senate have played a role very useful , that he the whether of the Speaker , of the services of the Clerk , of the staff in General and , well heard , of our members of security . 
our colleague , the senator Fairbairn , has spoke of Bessie . 
Bessie is a chienne an and I please the senator Fairbairn of the saluting of my share . 
I want thank all those of between you who me have the tribute here today today , and that all those who me have spoke in private . 
you you greatly waited my qualities and , by therefore , you you put the short very senior for me to the future .

after the birth of their child , the parents of the region the g offer the possible of participate volunteers to a process of assessment and of selection which the implementation in implement incombera to of the nurses in health public . 
the families who will right to the support to home will directed to a officer of the program " Meilleur departure . " 
this program is between other things to improve the operating of the family and to promote a interaction parent - child positive and that a healthy growth during the boyhood . 
the program will s in June 2000 . 
honourable senators , the children are our future and this year , to the opportunity of the Day national of the child , each community should the give as objective of do in so that the first years of the children be their best years .

question PERIOD PERIOD 
the Affairs foreign 
the Libya - - participation of the society Talisman EnergyInc. - - response to the criticism of the community international 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
I am am that all the world knows the parabole of the poutre and of the paille . 
the Canada the is fact the advocate of the well - be and of the security of the people across in the world . 
the Minister of the Affairs External , Mr. Axworthy , is speedy to criticize the country foreign who not respect not the rights of the people . 
yesterday , however , the 251 of state of the States - United has reversed the roles and has reducing criticized the Canada because that he continues of nothing with the Libya by the through of the business oil Talisman EnergyInc. , of Calgary . 
the Americans have also accused the government Liberal of have reversed to " the approach positive of the policy foreign in " or the " " on the atrocities took by the regime of Khartoum " . 
the 251 of state states that the activities of Talisman in the ways of Oil of the Libya are facilitées by the use of " " , of helicopters armed and of papers of Turkey against of the civilians not armed " by the government of Khartoum . 
the Americans are that the investment of Talisman in the sector pétrolier of the Libya encouragent the regime fondamentaliste of Khartoum to continue the War civil in the south of the country . 
until to now , the government of the Canada not has not still ordered to Talisman of the withdraw of the Libya and not has not imposed of sanctions to this country in despite of the pressure orchestrated since a year on the Minister Canadian of the Affairs foreign by of the NGOs Canadian and international of same that by the Coalition inter - Églises on the Africa . 
in fact , Mr. Axworthy just all fair of accept of send a mission of inquiry to the Libya . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , this question has been scope to the attention of the government of the Canada , and more specifically of the Minister appropriate . 
she is taken very to the seriously . 
the reports by a link between the business privacy Canadian having by the senator and of the abuses présumées of the rights of the human and of the right international create of serious concerns . 
as the hon. senator the has underlined , the Minister of the Affairs foreign has sent a commission Canadian independent to the Libya for whether the he there has of the links between the abuses of the rights of the human and the business in because . 
a report him will presented and he will the measures who the do after in have taken knowledge . 
the Libya - - participation of the society Talisman EnergyInc. - - policy of the government on the Opposition between the plateforme of the security human and the interests of the investors 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the question that the . must the question in the here , this is the of know if this business privacy Canadian impropriety the rights of the human and the right international . 
if this is the case , the government of the Canada could then consider of the sanctions economic and trade relatively to this activity . 
as in witnessing the measures that he has already taken , he is clear that the Minister is very " and that he Glenney handcuff as that he will in with the report of this commission independent . 
the trade international 
the Agreement of free - Exchange North - American - - trial was by a society Processors in consequential of the loss of a contract of Purchase of water in vrac - - Position of the government 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , I I a question to question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
I believe know that a small business Processors called Sunbelt has was a trial in damage - interests of about 10,5 billion of $ against the government federal for the cancellation of a contract by the government of the British - British in view of the Purchase of water in vrac . 
Sunbelt based the action on the provisions of the NAFTA regarding the rights of the investors and the treatment national - this is - to - say the rights tremendous of the investors - and ask of the damage - interests not only for the profits perdus , but also for the lack to gain . 
course , this action not will not heard by a court plain , but by a group of experts responsible of the regulation of the differences . 
the the of a decision recent of a group of experts of the NAFTA in a case origins a society American to the government mexicain and regarding also the rights tremendous of the investors , the government Canadian is - he prepared to the defend until to the across against this action of Sunbelt ? 
I there this question because that , in the unwitting case of the MMT , the government has capitulé before Ethyl Corporation and agreed of him be 20 million of $ . 
the because not has never been heard and the government has concédé that Ethyl Corporation had right to this compensation . 
can - you we say if the government is prepared to go until to the across in this case , the the of this precedent ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , clearly , the fact that this question be Before to a group Special of regulation of the differences seems significant a some controversy . 
I in speak to the Minister for know where in are the things . 
I remind that if the case is in decision before a court or a group Special of regulation of the differences , the response risk of be very brief . 
the senator Spivak : 
honourable senators , this case is before a group responsible of the regulation of the differences in the of trade international . 
he not the is not of hearings public and the procedure not is not transparent . 
the people to the Canada not know nothing of this who the what . 
this is a case of a great interest for the public . 
this is why I there the question here . 
the former Minister of the Trade international , Sergio Marchi , has all fact for to the process of regulation of the differences more transparent . 
he is important that the Canadians know if , in this case , the rights of the investors American just before those of the Canadians and if the government will be forced of be of the damage - interests not only for the profits perdus , but also for the lack to gain . 
this is a case extremely important . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the question fundamental , this is the Position of the government to the regard of the export of the water in major amount . 
I there that the hon. senator does fully this Position , to know that this country not should not flair the water in major amount . 
we we fact of great progress in this area and I am course that the hon. senator in agree . 
this case particular which about the senator Spivak can be the a of the results of this progress . 
however , I know the he would course to this at - this of discuss in detail of the strategy of the government and of the measures that he could take relatively to a case particular in which a business American written of great are . 
the policy of the government regarding the Defence against of the trial class by of the companies 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , if this is and and if the Leader not can dévoiler of details , he is important of know if , in this case - this , the government is prepared to follow the regulation of the differences . 
this Intelligence can certainly be the public . 
I hope that the government not règlera not to the secrecy with the society , as he the has fact in the case of the MMT . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I am sure that the government of the Canada will all to fact prepared to protect our interests on the notice of his counsel . 
I know what measures specific he will take . 
he not is not indicated of do know his Position for the moment . 
he is clear that , in this who respect the question of principle , the government has adopted a Position firm to the regard of the export of water in major amount . 
the government federal has from the cooperation of the provinces to this regard . 
we are 50 to a policy national that we défendrons by all the ways appropriate . 
the government does well the do . 
the business of the sénat 
point to the Rules 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I rise for ensure a some certainty in our procedures . 
the ) 56 ( 3 ) of the Rules of the Senate the on the question of the notice to give and said : : 
the notice 6 here can be tabled by a senator to the behalf of a other senator ... 
the senator Hays has given notice of a motion to the behalf of the Speaker good tempore . 
the ) 56 ( 3 ) specific that a senator can act to the behalf of a other senator absent , with the leave of this last . 
the ) 55 ( 3 ) for that when the Speaker wish participate to the debate , he must leave the Chair and invite a other senator to chairman the sitting . 
the senator who is also the Speaker can then participate fully to the debate as all other senator . 
I think that the same something the applies to the Speaker good tempore . 
for deal this case properly , he would was that her the Speaker good tempore leaving the Chair and that a other senator the ' , pursuant to this that for the ) 56 ( 3 ) and to the logical of the interventions such that she is being in the clause 55 of the Rules . 
we must respect this that has said the Speaker yesterday . 
I not contesterai not the would of the procedure followed , but to the future , he would can - be the conform to the Rules . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the Leader Deputy of the Opposition of have raised the question . 
I must recognize that I not I not asked the leave of propose the motion pursuant to the Rules but , to the listen , I conclude that he has reason if I I proposed the motion to the behalf of the Speaker good tempore . 
I I tried of explain the reason for which I I presented the motion , to know that she was the to a ask of the Speaker good tempore , this who not would can - be not should be mentioned . 
I should examine the the the for see this that I I said exactly .

bill of bill on the protection of the information personal and the documents electronic 
second Reading - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Kirby , seconded by the hon. senator Lewis , Honourable to the second Reading of the bill of bill C - 6 , Act to to facilitate and to promote the trade Ministerial in perpetuate the information personal collected , used or releases in some circumstances , in providing the use of ways electronic for to or put of the information and of the transactions and in amend the Act on the evidence to the Canada , the Act on the Statutory regulatory and the Act on the review of the laws . 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , the trade Ministerial is a question who me interest to the more senior point . 
I am therefore very happy of take share to the debate on the bill of bill C - 6 , Act on the protection of the information personal and the documents electronic . 
this initiative is to protect the uniqueness private of the information personal collected , used or releases by some agencies Canadian in the framework of activities trade . 
she states also of the criteria for a signing Ministerial sécurisée to the for of the transactions electronic treaties with the government and specific how the courts will authentifier the documents electronic admitted in evidence . 
the Canada has a need none of this bill for ensure the success of his participation to the economy World of the know , a economy in full encouraged who , to the say of the experts in the the , must detonated in least of a year . 
the at , as the said the senator Murray , is that the bill of bill C - 6 not is not to the up . 
the wording parliament to plant the confusion in the spirit and there of very serious gaps . 
he not is not sure that he can protect effectively the life privacy of the Canadians all in commercially the success of their participation to the trade Ministerial international . 
this is that a uncertainty which the Canada not has not the ways the he the maintain the advantage in the of competition in the economy World . 
the bill of bill C - 6 is the implement of a government which the temporisation the makes today today to develop to any track of the Statutory of bill for protect the Canadians in the context of the expansion next of the trade Ministerial . 
the government has left traîner the things and must to present up his two major partners commercial , the States - United and the Union European , who the are already any of the instruments devise necessary in the of trade Ministerial and of protection of the life privacy . 
we know all that . unless that the trade Ministerial will change the manner which the Canada slow the Affairs . 
our country is a Leader world in the of Technology of the information . 
however , the statistics 18.7 that the businesses of the country seem hesitate to use this powerful drives economic that is the trade Ministerial . 
of after a study seeing by Angus Reid , to the spring last , the businesses Canadian have been lentes to operating the opportunities of the trade Ministerial , well that 12,9 million of Canadians be cool . - inquiry 
the that , well that 90 per of the buyers in line Canadian at was their sites , only 38p. per intelligence really of the transactions in line with of the companies Canadian . 
that we brings to we ask what are the companies who which profit of the power of Purchase of the 62p. per of buyers in line Canadian group and in what country they the find . 
contrary to their Provincial Canadian , the businesses U.S. have known before the desirability of the revolution of the trade Ministerial . 
the small companies spécialisées and the géants of the industry such that Procter & Frosst , by example , stockpiles of the initiatives trade important who are the to use the Technology of the trade Ministerial for optimiser the services proposed to the consumers . 
compared , the businesses Canadian are very in behind by report to the businesses U.S. in this area . 
this imbalance could give to the States - United , our Main partner commercial and competition economic , the monopoly of the trade Ministerial when this last the functions really to the Canada . 
we might of losing of great income to the profit of our competitors American in reason of the consuming of the reaction of the sector private and of the government . 
the bill of bill C - 6 , in his form current , not will that only the situation and I will explain why . 
this bill of bill CRTC of way excessive the activities legitimate of the small and medium businesses and establishes a new framework regulatory clubs , without that . that chosen of study of the impact of the costs . 
he it also présager a new series of are federal - provincial , because the governments of the Quebec and of the Ontario the there opposed . 
a other problem is with to the fact that the bill of bill C - 6 the applies to of the agencies commercial , but . not knows too the he the applies to of the agencies without purpose profit or to of the professions as those of the right and of the medicine . 
by example , . not knows not specifically if this legislation legislative could the apply to the issues of a doctor . 
this not are that that few - few of the reasons for which the bill of bill C - 6 , the he is adopted in his Presented current , could entraver seriously the initiatives of the businesses Canadian in the of trade Ministerial . 
if this bill of bill well to limit the encouraged of the trade Ministerial in the sector private to the Canada , he is possible that he being to of the businesses foreign of the give a important advantage competitive home we . 
the nature same of the trade Ministerial allows to of the businesses foreign of wrestled to our regulations federal and provincial all in conservant the ability of from party of transactions financial with of the customers Canadian . 
this situation could have of the effects devastating on the sector private , the economy and , in across of blistering , the consumers of the Canada . 
the logical of the senator Murray me has am that the bill of bill C - 6 1 guarantee to two bills of bill in a . 
the cause part 1 of this bill of bill , who protects the information personal collected in the framework of all type of activity commercial 1 to a principle or to a purpose . 
the parties 2 to 5 have relates to the validation of the documents and process electronic in under of the Act on the evidence to the Canada , of the Act on the Statutory regulatory and of the Act on the review of the laws and are axées on a all other principle . 
according me , who in two the bill of bill C - 6 would the honourable senators and the committee in the study of the document and , this by , their would of the thoughts to a review distinct and in full of the two themes and principles that the . ' in this bill of bill . 
the parties 2 to 5 have been examined quickly and almost studiously to the House of the Commons in reason of the debate has in response to the part 1 . 
the Senate has now the opportunity of the thoughts to a analysis careful of the applicability of these sections innovative proposed who these to the implementation in place of the trade Ministerial to the country and of legislation a status legal clear to some documents electronic . 
he is important that the committee that the opportunity of study carefully these sections . 
this legislation legislative the fact expect since long and must be agreed of any emergency . 
in this who respect the part 1 , all the aspects of the provisions of the bill of bill regarding the protection of the life privacy must be analyzed in full . 
the committee not should not feel that . the press of do the study , little any the speed with which the government can wish that the bill of bill franchisse the step of the Senate . 
the protection of the life privacy is a right basic of all the Canadians and a legislation legislative the is certainly in this area . 
, the over of the last session of the Parliament , the committee Standing of the industry of the House of the Commons has length examined the bill of bill C - 54 , the predecessor of the - this . 
he has heard the evidence of a great number of citizens , of experts and of agencies concerned , who have spoke of the importance of we determining of a bill strong and effective for protect the information personal and for promote the trade Ministerial to the Canada . 
among these groups the were of the representatives of the Association medical Canadian , who the are interestingly to the bill of bill because that he was to regulate the use and the communication of information to of the for trade and that he walked of have of the consequences negative for the care of health and the system of health . 
recently , of other associations in care of the health and professionals of the health have phoned , wrote , and advocates of the from by mail Ministerial and by monitored to my office for express their concerns to the about of the bill of bill C - 6 . 
the representatives of the Association dental Canadian me have informed that this bill of bill : 
they have asked that the Senate ruined for clarify and strengthen the provisions of the bill of bill who them on the information personal in the of health . 
the Dr. David Zitner , steering of the technology medical to my former alma mater , the University Dalhousie , to Halifax , has release with me for me speak wording of this aspect . 
he has said : 
, the Canada , the tradition to that . using of the information personal for the well public ( with of the mechanisms appropriate for protect the life privacy and ensure the confidentiality ) . 
the activities of census constitute a example where of the people can be forced of provide of the information personal in the interest public . 
the Dr. Zitner believes vital that a bill appropriate the in so that the agencies of the health , the governments and the instituts of research so use the information collected for the thoughts to of the activities of research in health and of improvement of the quality of the care , in significant of mechanisms appropriate for ensure the protection , the security and the confidentiality of these information personal . 
that means that the agencies of research and the institutions of health could use a bloc of information and write of the reports in consequential . 
the Association of the Society Canadian is also préoccupée by the bill of bill C - 6 . 
in his Presented to the committee of the industry of the House of the Commons , she has said that the part 1 omissions three major problems . 
first , the structure of the part 1 is unusual in right Canadian and not give not really of good results . 
the standard has volunteers been designed as a series of lines guidelines that a organization must to in application and not as a Code juridiquement locks who creates of the rights and of the devoirs precise . 
second , the notaires has seen a net possible for that the role and the responsibilities of the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy which some difficulties on the plan of the procedure . 
for , to the balance wanted between the rights of the human and the development of the trade Ministerial , the government must ensure to this that the authority public responsible of the enforcement of the part 1 that all the resources necessary for do the work effectively . 
by , , for ensure the protection of the life privacy of the people he not must not use of the ways who own the right of the organizations and of their employees to the confidentiality because this would that a use brings of his own rights procéduraux and the bill appear unfair . 
the committee Senate has therefore many of work rectificatif to do for clarify this awful . 
third , the Association of the Society has said that the bill of bill raised of the questions with the Constitution , for this who is of the Division of the powers between the governments federal and provincial , and the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms . 
the bill of bill is so ambigu that the Society Canadian not could say categorically if the government federal réussirait to exercise his powers if the legislation Year in into . 
, the across of the the , the association doutait that the bill of bill intestine to a challenge judicial . 
according the Position finally agreed by the Society , the difficulties that raises the part 1 , regarding the structure , the procedures and the Constitution , must be corrigées before the into in into of the bill of bill , because that they now of resulting of the problems of interpretation who finiront by undermine the importance of this legislation . 
honourable senators , he must absolutely that we , in this House of reflection , surmontions the barrier and done this that the government not has not fact - correct the weaknesses of the bill of bill C - 6 . 
we not can more we pay the luxury of expect . 
the price to pay for the attentisme or the procrastination in this who respect the implementation in implement of a bill on the trade Ministerial is too high . 
this trade is in expansion and the Canada not can the allow of not not be prepared . 
he wanted exchange on the about , to as of Canadian of the region Atlantic and of chairman - chairman of the and of the Information Quarterly held , or ITI , a of the centres of training in Technology of the information the more prestigious in America of the North for the graduates academic . 
Mr. . Cameron me has said that the drain to the States - United of Canadians to a strong training university is is and well real and that he is to the increase in the sector of the Technology of the information . 
this situation is become for him a source of dilemma staff . 
in as that enseignant , Mr. Cameron is happy of see that of the businesses of high Technology the tears his students and their may of the jobs enthousiasmants , assortis of excellent salaries . 
in as that Canadian and taxpayer Canadian , he not is not also happy of see that the majority of the businesses who recrutent his students are of the companies U.S. . 
the businesses U.S. are so empressées of would the more great number possible of graduates in Technology of the information that some have same began to offer of the jobs to of the students of the ITI before same that they have debated their training . 
I I noticed the malaise grew Mr. Cameron having by report to the fact that a number growing of students of the ITI who have around their studies on the trade Ministerial are now courtisés attender by several companies U.S. . 
a time that they have from their had , he is rare that these students two in our country , Mr. Cameron think that we we already lost , to the profit of the States - United , a number important of experts in trade Ministerial who have received their training to the Canada . 
the States - United have already a length of advance on we in the development and the implementation in implement of strategies before allow of from profit of the economy World represents on the know . 
the response me of the sector private Canadian to the regard of the trade Ministerial , conjuguée to the political government inquiries on the plan tax and by report to the would of the loans students , role in favour of the businesses U.S. . 
we not are not on a at of equality with the Americans , and he we will very difficult of support their competition in the area of the trade Ministerial . 
the bill of bill C - 6 , who the based of the hardships implementation in implement by the Union European and who will to the any of the approach American current , not will that empirer the things . 
he must adopt a bill of bill who plan the information personal if we want that the people accept the idea of the trade Ministerial . 
the Adopted of this bill of bill is also necessary for allow to this new drives economic of succeed to the the national and international . 
the bill of bill C - 6 not we will not of achieve these objectives . 
honourable senators , we not can all simply not we allow of adopt the bill of bill C - 6 such that he is some to the time current . 
we we here the opportunity of amending this bill of bill to that he protects the life privacy of the Canadians all in allowing to the sector private of vibrant and of stay canada by report to our Main partner commercial , well course , but also to the the World . 
( on the motion of the senator Kinsella , to the behalf of the senator Keon , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the Act on the Defence national - Act on the identification by the fingerprints génétiques - Code criminal 
bill of bill Amend - Second Reading 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Fraser , seconded by the hon. senator Ruck , Honourable to the second Reading of the bill of bill S - 10 , Act amend the Act on the Defence national , the Act on the identification by the fingerprints génétiques and the Code criminal . 
the hon. Pierre Claude Nolin : 
honourable senators , before of planned my speech , I like thank the Solicitor General of the Canada for have the the of the points that I I raised during of the study of the bills of laws C - 25 , Act amend the Act on the Defence national and of other laws in consequential , and of the bill of bill C - 3 , Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques and amend the Code criminal and of other laws in consequential for the development of the bill of bill S - 10 . 
these bills of bill have been adopted during of the first session of the 30 - sixth Parliament . 
I am happy of see that the Minister has also taken in consideration the recommendations of the sixteenth report of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional on the bill of bill C - 3 , in this who has relates to the changes to to to the laws for to the management of the bank national of data génétiques more effective and more respectueuse of the right to the life privacy of the Canadians . 
honourable senators , he me fact happy today today of speak in favour of the bill of bill S - 10 , Act amend the Act on the Defence national , the Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques and the Code criminal . 
he has for purpose of include in the bank national of data génétiques , who has been created by the Adopted of the bill of bill C - 3 , in December 1998 , the profiles of identification was of the offenders were in under of the system of justice military . 
as you the know , currently , the provisions of the bill not with that the offenders who will were by the system of courts civilians . 
since the introduction to the Canada in 1988 , the analysis of the ADN to of the for médico - legal has for of obtain the condemnation of authors of some crimes violent , and that the been in freedom of people condamnées to wrong by the courts . 
the use of this instrument powerful in the framework of investigations criminal the is made in two steps . 
first , in 1995 , of the changes were made to the Code criminal , for allow the levy of ADN to the assistance of a mandate in the purpose facilitate the too of some investigations police and the identification of suspects . 
by the the , in September 1997 , the bill of bill C - 3 was tabled before the House of the Commons . 
he had for purpose of encadrer for the first time the structure and the Administration of a bank national of fingerprints génétiques . 
this new legislation the inscrivait in the second step of the action of the government . 
he had for objective of establish a bank national made the profiles of identification was of the people scant guilty of offences criminal serious and violent , and of the échantillons of ADN cannot on the site of crimes not solved . 
the bank of data should be NDHQ of here June of the year 2000 , and she will appropriately by the Mounted Royal of the Canada , who who now six Laboratories court to the country . 
honourable senators , well that I my seconded the ; who have led to the Adopted of the bill of bill C - 3 , I I all of same found , the to a review thorough of this new legislation , that the departments of the Solicitor General and of the Justice had forgotten of there include the profiles of identification was of the members of the staff military who would were for of the offences serious and violent , as this is the case for the individuals who will cannot guilty of such crimes by our system of courts civilians . 
the 6 October 1998 , the Minister of the Defence , Arthur tote , his before the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional for present the provisions of the bill of bill C - 25 . 
as the - this had for purpose of reform the system of justice military , I I asked to the Minister if the military charged or cannot guilty in under of the new bill would issues to the application of the provisions domain in the bill of bill C - 3 . 
, the time , I I also asked to the Minister what body of police , of the RCMP or of the police military would responsible of the levy of échantillons of ADN and of their conservation in the case of offences who impliquent of the military . 
honourable senators , these questions were very important because , according the provisions of the bill of bill C - 25 , the offences of order body took by of the military were now and of the courts military . 
of more , the Minister of the Justice , Anne McLellan , had already justified the creation of a bank of fingerprints génétiques for that the policiers have a effectiveness increased and be in legislation of stop more quickly the perpetrators sexual and the murderers to repetition . 
despite all , the Minister and the military of the Defence national not have not been in legislation of answer to these questions . 
the Brigadier - General J . Pitzul , of the they Canadian , has should that he not knew not if the bill of bill C - 3 was the apply to the staff of the they and of the Defence national , same the he had already had several meetings with of the members of the Department of the Justice in this who had relates to the reform of the system of justice military . 
he the was therefore of a oversight very important in the bill , if the . consider that the bill of bill C - 25 was to the Administration of the justice , to the within of the Forces Armed Canadian , more transparent . 
in this sense , he was unacceptable that the military from of a status particular in the excluded of the application of the provisions of the new Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques . 
that is particularly true if the . the the of the fact that to the over of the last years , several scandals involving of the military in mission to the abroad in of the case abuse them and of Ways of fact serious have défrayé the headlines to the Canada . 
these incidents have terni the image of the they Canadian and of the system of justice in the people Canadian . 
the organization of our society , all as the of our right , require the consistency . 
all the citizens are equal before the bill . 
they have of the same rights but also of the same obligations before the bill . 
, the time , the members of the committee not had not felt good of amending the bill of bill C - 25 for that the staff military be submitted to the application of the clause , regarding the bank of fingerprints génétiques . 
honourable senators , when we we examined the bill of bill C - 3 in committee , I I raised of new this question with of the Solicitor General of the Canada , who was responsible of this new legislation . 
in a Prime time , I wanted know if the Department was in agreed with this that had should the Minister of the Defence and the officers of the they Canadian . 
in a second time , I intended that the Minister me say that he had the the of their evidence for to of the changes to the bill of bill C - 3 . 
the response to these two questions was not . 
during of the business of the committee , I had also been of serious reserves as to the effectiveness and to the or of some provisions of the bill of bill who was ensure , including , that the échantillons of ADN and the profiles not would not used to of other for that those for in the bill , this is - to - say for of the for of inquiry criminal , and that the right to the life privacy of the people who would inquiries to the levy of ADN be sufficient . 
I had also has in question the fact that the bill of bill provided that the profiles génétiques , who would Democrats in the " fichier criminalistique " and the " fichier of the were " , were be people pronouncements after that a inquiry was déclarée not public , that a individual not was more considered as suspect , or if a verdict of acquittement or of not - about final was said by the court to the place of a accused . 
according me , these profiles , despite this that have should the scientific of the RCMP , the were of be spawning for reduce the risk that they be used to of other for that those prescrites in the bill . 
in December 1998 , the sixteenth report of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional illegality the emergency of establish a bank national of fingerprints génétiques who would to the different body policiers of the country of operating fully the progress technological recent in this area for improve the security public . 
the report recommended therefore to the government federal of strengthen the provisions legislation regarding the Administration of the bank of data génétiques and the security of the information who will domain in this last . 
in the purpose of answer to these concerns and for allow and the Adopted of the bill of bill C - 3 , for Authorize the creation immediate of the bank of data génétiques , the Solicitor General of the Canada , Lawrence MacAulay , the is committed , during of his appearance before the committee , the 7 December 1998 , to present during the intervalle provided of 18 months between the Assent Royal and the into in into of the bill of bill C - 3 , a new bill of bill who would including of expand the juridiction of the bank of data génétiques to the Offenders who are recognized guilty in the system of justice military ; of to the Commissioner of the Mounted Royal of the Canada to to the of the operating of the bank of data génétiques in the report annual to the Minister before the Tabled before the Parliament ; of include in the new bill of bill a clause require a review Parliamentary all the five years for relieve the concern of the members of the committee regarding the nature very sensitive the information that contiendra the bank of data génétiques and of the evolution quick of the Technology in this area , and give to the committees of the Senate and of the House of the Commons the same power of proceed to the review mindful who will provided by the new bill . 
he is important of mention that all these elements from in the sixteenth report of the committee . 
honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 10 has been public in service of some points soulignés in the report of the committee . 
according me , he the is of the third step of the legislation federal in the area of the use of the fingerprints génétiques for the too of investigations criminal . 
by against , the Solicitor General has asked that the bill of bill be presented to the Senate before of be tabled before the House of the Commons to that the senators so the ensure that all the points considered préoccupants have been completed properly by your committee Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional . 
to relaté the historic of this bill of bill , I like now to the question of the changes proposed by the bill of bill S - 10 . 
, the words of the new bill of bill , as I the I mentioned to the beginning of my speech , the profiles of identification was of the offenders justiciables in under of the Code of discipline military who are declared guilty of a offence serious and particular of violence will included in the bank of data génétiques . 
this Code the applies to the staff military , to the Reserves and to some civilians who accompanies of the members of the staff military to the abroad . 
in under of the provisions of the bill of bill S - 10 , the judges military will legal , first , to to of the guidelines provisions to the bank of data génétiques to the regard of people justiciables , in under of the Code of discipline military , who will been déclarées guilty of a offence pantheon in under of the Printed of the Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques , and second , to spirituality of the mandates debates to the his génétiques to the for of investigations which by the police military on of the offences désignées who will been took by of the people the under the juridiction of the Code of discipline military , to the Canada as to the abroad . 
currently , the bill allows the police military to obtain a mandate for the levy of ADN only the he the is of a offence who was commise to the Canada . 
the fact that the police military be now Cabinet to obtain a mandate for a offence pantheon commise to the abroad is a net improvement , if the . the the of the fact that more de4 $ members of the staff military are in service heroic missions to the abroad and that of the incidents serious involving of the military Canadian the are products in Somalia and in Bosnia - Herzégovine . 
as in the case of the provisions current of the Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques , the bill of bill S - 10 for that the échantillons and that the results of the his must be sent to the Commissioner of the Mounted Royal of the Canada for be tabled in the bank of data . 
the new bill for also that the provisions who will included in the Act on the Defence national , regarding the Authorized of inquire of ADN , the manipulation and the conservation of the échantillons and the results of analysis was , and the guarantees in this who has relates to the respect of the right to the life privacy , will identiques to those who are domain in the Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques . 
by against , they have been adjusted to the context of the system of justice military . 
he is important of remind that the Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques contains a list of offences désignées who refers that all individual court for the a of these offences could do the subject of a taken of fingerprints génétiques for for of analysis médico - legal . 
this list has been divided in two types of offences : resource and school . 
in the case of the offences International , the échantillons are bailed treaties to the time of the condemnation , except in of the case of circumstances exceptional . 
. there find including the offences with violence the more serious and the offences to uniqueness body , offences that the elements of evidence to uniqueness was can the better élucider . 
. there ' including the offences following : inceste , and to of the for them , murder , homicide involontaire found , sexual they or infliction of lésions , , infliction intentionnelle of lésions , , sexual sexual , sexual sexual serious , enlèvement and séquestration . 
in the case of the offences high , the levy not is not required . 
by against , the Crown must convince the Justice that the levy of échantillons is in the interest of the security public . 
he the is of offences least serious where the analysis was not can not always be used for solve a crime or in prevent of other . 
. there ' between other these elements : use of bombs , actions of piraterie , Ways of fact , introduction by effraction in a stimulate criminal , fire criminal , infliction of the death by neglect criminal , Ways of fact against a officer of the peace , flight qualified , taken of hostage . 
in under of the bill of bill S - 10 , this list who limit the situations where he there has inquire of ADN the apply now to the members of the staff military who will been were for have made these offences . 
in a Prime time , the new bill for amend some parties of the Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques for to the of the changes made to the Act on the Defence national . 
of more , the clause 12 of the bill of bill for that , in the five years following the into in into of the bill , a committee of the Senate , of the House of the Commons or Joint welcomes to a review of the provisions and of the application of the bill . 
this same clause for also that a report on the activity of the bank of data will tabled each year by the Commissioner of the Mounted Royal of the Canada . 
he will tabled before each House of the Parliament in the 15 first days of sitting of the - this following the be of this last . 
these changes will for effect of answer to the concerns of the members of the committee in giving to the Parliament the ways of better monitor and of control the Administration of the bank of data génétiques . 
finally , the bill is amended by the bill of bill S - 10 for that he be clear statement that the profiles of identification was and the marine , random in view of the establish not must serve that to of the for of identification during of investigations criminal . 
honourable senators , I wish to out that the bill of bill S - 10 made also several changes of order technical for make more some aspects of the Code criminal in this who has relates to the application of the Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques . 
these changes were proposed the to the creation of a group of work federal - provincial who had for mandate of to in Bill the new bank of data génétiques . 
the to several meetings , the officials provincial of the sectors of the security public and of the justice have should that the bill current not was not enough clear in this who has relates to the circumstances who are that a Justice not has not to Appear a levy of ADN . 
the bill of bill S - 10 does to these concern in supply clear that a levy not has not to be ordered if the court is informed that the profile was of the human fall the find already in the bank of data génétiques . 
of more , the bill of bill S - 10 for that a Justice of a court provincial will authorized to viserne order or a Authorized of levy of ADN who will been made or adjudication in a other province . 
finally , this bill of bill made several other changes technical to the Code criminal for that the regime regarding the levy of marine , for analysis was to of the for médico - legal be clarifié and strengthened . 
in ending , honourable senators , I am happy of see to new that , through to the resolute of the members of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , the Act on the Defence national , the Act regarding the identification by the fingerprints génétiques and the Code criminal will , to my notice , and I am course that you be of agreed with me , greatly améliorés by the bill of bill S - 10 for answer to the concerns of this House regarding the creation and the management of the new bank national of data génétiques . 
as I the I said to the beginning of my speech , he the is of a tool extremely powerful who will of the impact important on our system of justice and on our society . 
the provisions of the bill of bill S - 10 will in so that the right to the life privacy of the Canadians will more sufficient in balisant of way more specific for the policiers and the courts the use of profiles génétiques for of the for of investigations criminal . 
I can you ensure that the bill of bill will the subject of a review seriously by the committee for the ensure that he will to the concerns émises by the members this House he there has now year .

honourable senators , any legislation legislative with to the questions of life and of death require of the parliamentarians a reflection of the more depth . 
this is therefore very carefully that I I examined the bill of bill S - 2 , Act admissibility the taken of decisions medical legitimate relatively to the treatment of survival and to the treatment of the pain . 
I I consulted of distinguished éthiciens , which of the members of the Association Catholic Canadian of the health and of the Care - in - Dying Coalition / Canadian Coalition Against Euthanasia , which meeting a Hamani of organizations disséminées in all the country who préconisent the be compassionate , fair and respectueux of the unevenly . 
I am also call to my experience personal for the for of the study of this bill of bill . 
, as staff , I I had to take of the decisions and to do of the recommendations regarding the relevance of extend the care medical that actual of the people ones in stage seeks . 
I know of experience how he can be difficult of take this kind of decision for the professionals of the health and the members of the family . 
in addition , he is important in the framework of a such debate legislative of determine the convictions personal of each , this that each having in the for within . 
I believe firmly in the dignity and in the value does of the human human . 
I believe that all the people human must be respected , and this , to all the steps of the life , of the conception to the death . 
in clear , honourable senators , I me against to the euthanasia and to the suicide attended because that these ways are propensity with the dignity human . 
by , , I acknowledge the rights legal that the patients have of refuse a treatment and I am all to fact in favour of the promotion of the care palliative as way of inevitable the suffering physical . 
the illness , the suffering and the death are part integral of the experience human . 
the act of die can be the opportunity of a his taken of conscience of itself who being to of the people of saying freely and consciemment the means of their life , and not simply a process inexorable which he must the put passivement . 
of other share , the advanced scientific and technological in the of care of health have improved California our ability of soigner the diseases , of inevitable the suffering and of extend the life . 
these progress not are not without raise of the questions éthiques that the society not had never had to the question . 
he is of the case where extend the life by of the ways artificiels is a painful burden for the human mourante or the family . 
he is necessary of happen to a balance between two obligations : the of not not give intentionnellement the death to a human and the of not not approach , for maintain a human in life , to of the procedures who imposeraient a burden disproportionate by report to the benefits to from of these procedures . 
the the of that , I find that the bill of bill S - 2 has to the time some aspects positive and some aspects negative . 
I support the intention of the bill of bill , who is of make the distinctions surrounding the decision of to end to the life of a human , in particular the any or the interruption of the treatment , the case if , and the use of pharmacare for already the pain . 
he is legal and moral that a soignant given of the pharmacare for already the pain to a human which the life is in danger , same if these pharmacare now of abréger the life of the human in question , to condition that the intention not be not of resulting the death . 
the Senate to been informed of the fact that some coping entrepreneurial to administering enough of pharmacare for already the pain by fear of be criminellement responsible , this bill of bill is a legislation positive . 
the inclusion in this bill of bill of a clause making that Health Canada which of the lines guidelines national relatively to the forbearance and to the interruption of the traitemen , recommending the professionals of the health and improving their training in this who respect the treatment of the pain and the care palliative and the of the research on the fréquence of forbearance or of interruption of the treatment is a other legislation positive . 
, present that we we established the need of protect the coping who want do inevitable the pain of the patients , we must ensure to this that this legislation legislative , if she is agreed , not be not a the met to the euthanasia direct , légalisée . 
this is this that redoute the Coalition national for the life , who consider this bill of bill as a Prime not to the creation of a ask in the area of the assistance to the suicide . 
honourable senators , is the dilemma which we are face . 
how be course that the act medical soulage indeed the pain , well that he be a of abréger the life ? 
how know if a patient not has not been submitted to of the pressure for that he accept the treatment ? 
this treatment become he of use day in the case where he not would not of danger of death ? 
in few words , would - we on the point of exploring the integrity of the life , which , in our quality of legislators , we are held of protect in despite of our desire legitimate of inevitable the pain ? 
is as of questions who ineffective a review thorough in committee Senate , if the bill of bill had to preferred the step of the second Reading . 
, my notice , we should give the to this initiative . 
the question deserves that we done the effort of develop a good text of bill in the interest of all the Canadians . 
well that this text not amend not the Code criminal , I believe understand that he not is not to in relieve the provisions prevented the euthanasia and the suicide attended . 
however , in the wording present , nothing not guarantees that this be indeed the case . 
the question deserves a new review and a more ample reflection . 
he appropriate of make that the human to which he is fact referring to the clause 2 is a human which the Late is passing and inexorable . 
he not must not omettre of the make , this who not is not the case to present . 
if the intention of the législateur is of inevitable the suffering of a individual struck of a affection virtuellement mortelle , that this the be clear indicated in the text . 
I move , during of the study in committee , that be made a amendment appropriate to this clause , followed of changes corrélatives . 
honourable senators , he must also the remind that he there has of the situations establish a danger of death who not are not 2.4 to a death imminente and inexorable . 
he there has of many conditions predicted and to long term who not it not necessarily the life in danger . 
a diabétique who fact a had diabétique fact opposite to a condition délétère , but the death not is never imminente or inexorable . 
of more , a human who is supposed be in stage seeks , who systemic of a illness chronic or which the condition the worsening not is not typifies in a situation délétère , and the bill of bill should the make clear . 
for the moment , I canada the principle that that a human who fact opposite to the threat of a death imminente and inexorable has right to the relief of his suffering and that the doctor or the infirmière who load and his suffering not should not be passible of the . 
however , we not must not open the the to the euthanasia direct . 
he must the ensure that he not there that not a bad interpretation of the real subject of the bill of bill . 
I urge the Senate to act of way diligente in this case . 
in response to the question that I him I reply when she has open the debate in second Reading , the senator Carstairs has quoted the catéchisme of the Church Catholic as following : 
same if the death is considered as imminente , the care ongoing related to a human patient not can be legitimately aborted . 
the use of the analgésiques for credit the suffering of the moribond , same to the risk of abréger his days , can be morally consistent to the dignity human if the death not is not deal , or as end or as way ... 
this or , honourable senators , is useful , but memories - we that she is created by the statement next : 
what that in be the ; and the ways , the euthanasia direct is to to end to the life of people disabilities , patients or compassionate . 
she is morally suggested . 
I am sure that in unissant their efforts , the senators can write a bill who will to maintain the dignity and the rights of a patient which the death is imminente and inexorable and that the standards professional of a professional of the health . 
honourable senators , this bill of bill we give also the opportunity of strengthen the support to the programs of care palliative to the Canada . 
of good care palliative are for to credit the suffering and to improve the quality of life of the people who live with a illness avancée or who in long . 
renforçons this need growing to the Canada . 
( on the motion of the senator Roche , to the behalf of the senator Roux - Roux , the debate is adjourned . )

in a letter that I adressais to the Minister of the Affairs foreign , the hon. Lloyd Axworthy , the 2 November last , I told to the Minister a implementation to day and that the measures concrete taken by the Department since the Tabled of this report . 
without have still received a response , he appert that the healthier of the Finance public has substantially reduced the assistance made Canadian to the country in seaway of development . 
then that the committee recommended of at the budget to the assistance public to the development to 0,7p. per of the 12,000 , this ratio is past of 0,45p. per in 1991 to 0,26p. per for the year financial 99 - 2000 .

this is in 1932 - 1933 that the Leader Soviet Joseph Stalin , in view of contraindre the million of farmers ukrainiens to to to the agriculture collective Soviet , has adopted , of way démoniaque , several tactics to to dramatically a refer policy . 
he has adopted of the measures such that the increase of the quota of supply céréalier in Ukraine to completion per , to of create a lack so of grain and of lead the inability of the paysans ukrainiens of the esteem , the implementation in place of a system of passeports international for to limit the travelling of the Ukrainiens to the research of food , the enforcement of any human surprise to take or to hide of the grain in a kolkhoze , the persecution of thousands of thinkers , of writers and of leaders ukrainiens and the assaut to the assistance of tanks and of Turkey of villages habités by of the farmers without Defence . 
this not are that that few - few of the measures political horribles taken by the Leader Soviet Joseph Stalin and by the man of with Lazar Kaganovich in view of sky the will of resistance of the Ukraine . 
despite the efforts has been for hide or effacer the atrocity of this refer policy , of the academic service have coast of the evidence concrete who allow of assessment to about 10 million the number of victims of the genocide . 
he is regrettable that the world Western not that not recognized or including the magnitude of the genocide when the Union Soviet there still . 
the leaders current of the Khruschev to recognized this event historic atrocious , this last must be including and commémoré . 
he wrote : 
this that I I seen this morning - that was if prosecutors that he not there has not of words for the describe . 
they had been taken to the piège and caught each home him to die of hunger , pursuant to a decision policy taken in a capital very remote , around of tables of conference and of service . 
they not had same not the peerage of the inévitabilité for inevitable the horror .

they the are bornés to say that he not was not , by extrapolation , apply their decision to of the circumstances other that those who are simple by she . 
, the time current , the government the consistent to this judgment , and the confusion that the Court Supreme has made will of a great lot for the discussions who are in over and who , hope - the , poisoned of the results positive .

given given that he has created the Appendix that the cabinet support the idea that the judgment over the right ancestral to several other resources , and the given that the Leader seat to the table of the cabinet , he want can - be do understand to his colleagues of the cabinet that he would bring to the not this clone of Doug Young and the to to the conform to the Position of the cabinet .

the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I hope that the senator Comeau me pardonnera if I greetings the sentiment General to the Minister in of the words a little more moderate . 
I not I not heard directly his comments , but the Minister wanted can - be say that any the question aboriginal is more broader and not the reduced not to a sector particular of the resources . 
I believe that the confusion made by the Court Supreme the is disinfection useful for solve this who is a problem very immediate in the sector of the fishing . 
I hope therefore that the . bill to solve the problem when the representative of the government in the the appreciate the various parties interested of the world of the fishing , there including the representatives aboriginal in the region of the Atlantic .

the Libya - - role of the society Talisman Project - - Position of the government on the Opposition between the plateforme of the security human and the interests of the investors 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
she fact the in reality to a question that I I raised the week last to the hon. Minister regarding the society Talisman Project , of Calgary . 
this morning same , the coverage let continues of the situation which that of the shareholders of Talisman , including a group representative of the funds of mutual and of the funds of Pension of congrégations religious , are pressure since a year on the society for that she at the consequences Social and economic of his presence to the Libya . 
in a clause released today today in the branch " Opinions " of the Globe and Mail , Tim Ryan , a priest Catholic who is since long actionnaire of Talisman , described the efforts been for to this society of energy , and that all the companies Canadian , to assume the role of stakeholders responsible in the economy and to adopt a Code of the rights of the human . 
the government is - he prepared to protect the interests of the shareholders Canadian if the mission of inquiry as attendue which that the presence of Talisman EnergyInc. to the Libya contributes directly to the violation of the rights of the human in this country ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
I me undertake to the do . 
as to know if the government Canadian will of the measures for protect the shareholders , I not am not sure of understand this that the hon. senator does by that . 
the he could me give more of Particulars on the kind of measures that he maybe appropriate , I could can - be him give a response . 
the senator Oliver : 
SelonM. Ryan in the clause of the Globe and Mail , the chairman of Talisman would asked : " Pourquoi we ? " 
this to what , always ENAP Ryan , a group of shareholders would answered : 
... this that we asking to Talisman we we systematically of the obtain of all the companies : a Code of conduct exhaustive covering the rights by of the human and that the standards scant in the social , environmental and of work , of the repères appropriate allowing of measurement the respect of these commitments and a system of audit credible of the performance of the society . 
the senator Boudreau : 
in this who respect the society same , I I already said to the honourable senators that if the inquiry confirmed the very serious allegations which she fact the subject , he is obvious that he would consider of take of the measures against this last , or against any other society the finding in a situation similar . 
in this who respect of the measures specific that the government of the Canada could take to the behalf of the shareholders for protect their interests financial or for Appear to the society of take some measures , I not know always not to the fair this that move the senator . 
the senator Oliver : 
the shareholders have said that some measures that they would see for ensure the protection of the rights of the human and of other rights are already Answers in of the conventions approved on the plan international , as the Declaration Universal of the rights of the man , the conventions of Geneva , the conventions of the Organization international of the work and the Convention of the UN Current to the rights of the child . 
they looking that be colleague these conventions and statements which the Canada is signatory . 
the senator Boudreau : 
in this who has relates to the actions of someone society that this be , we must insist on the respect of some standards of conduct . 
the allegations reviewers of serious questions , between other , if this society has respected or not these standards . 
if a inquiry and a report indicate that she not the has not fact , the government instead of take of the measures against she . 
I believe that he may is all to fact legitimate for the shareholders of proceed of this way . 
that some shareholders decision or not of give some guidelines to the board of Administration , the government of the Canada does lead the inquiry until to the across and , the the of the findings of this inquiry , he instead of take the measures appropriate against the society .

I think that he has succeeded of way remarkable to find the balance wanted . 
then that the events in of other regions of the world the précipitaient , he has been in legislation of maintain the Cape and , in fact , of create a unkind who has for to our economy of know a good growth and of continue his growth to a pace remarkable . 
our rate of growth has been almost without equivalent in not any which of the great country industrialized . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , I in conclude then that we should as believe the comments of the Prime Minister to the about of the Governor of the Bank of the Canada that those that he has made on the GST . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I not jouais not a role active to the time of the Governor Crow , but . establishes a balance of way different according the circumstances . 
when he the is of determine if the rate of interest are to a level appropriate , that depends many of the unkind economic to this time - that . 
if the economy the the well - this is - to - say that she is in full period of expansion - then , he is can - be appropriate of have a rate different of this that he would in period of recession . 
the rate of growth real of the economy has been of close of 4 per to the over of the four the trimestres and . for maintain a strong growth . 
the growth of the Canada , among the country of the G - 7 and in the world industrialisé , not is dépassée that by the of the States - United .

I it that to the Governor of the Bank of the Canada .

bill of bill on the protection of the information personal and the documents electronic 
second Reading - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Kirby , seconded by the hon. senator Lewis , Honourable to the second Reading of the bill of bill C - 6 , Act to to facilitate and to promote the trade Ministerial in perpetuate the information personal collected , used or releases in some circumstances , in providing the use of ways electronic for to or put of the information and of the transactions and in amend the Act on the evidence to the Canada , the Act on the Statutory regulatory and the Act on the review of the laws . 
the hon. Wilbert J . Keon : 
honourable senators , I like benefit of the opportunity for do few brief comments on the bill of bill C - 6 . 
this is a bill of bill extremely necessary that I support with enthusiasm , all in to few reserves . 
I hostility therefore the need of do few brief comments on the bill of bill before that he be referred to a committee . 
since few years , the ability of the Canada of meet , of maintain , of fusionner , of transfer and of use of the information the is substantially percent . 
he in result that of the information in all kind circulent in the country , and same across , on the world , with more of freedom and of speed that never before . 
certainly , the Rich of our ability to this regard there of the benefits , but he not in remains not least that the question of the cueillette , of the disclosure and of the use of the information raises a sure number of concerns provisions to their uniqueness private and " . 
honourable senators , to the obviously , the bill of bill C - 6 has for subject of protect the information personal collected by the sector private and , in fact , of we allow of up the progress of the Technology . 
since 1982 , the Act on the protection of the life privacy protects the information personal held by the government federal . 
the provinces the are pourvues of Statutory similar . 
however , he not in will not of same for the information held by the sector private . 
, this regard , this bill of bill the is length fact expect . 
we not must not act too quickly , without have examined to further all the impact of this initiative . 
he not is not a area where the uniqueness private and " of the information held not is also important that the of the health . 
the perception and the concerns of the people in the of Clinic and of treatment of the information on the health are well whom , but they deserve of be rappelées to the seen of the questions that I wish raise to comments of the bill of bill . 
in a Prime time , the patients believe that the information medical the regarding remain confidentiels . 
then , they feel important of know what use their will Senators and to who these the will releases , and they not want particularly not that these information be released to of the third without that they not in be informed and without that they not have given their agreed . 
finally , the patients could hesitate to opportunity of the information the regarding to the professionals of the health the they the interrogent on the use or the disclosure desdites information . 
, the ) 2 ( 1 ) of the bill of bill , . does by " Intelligence staff " all Intelligence regarding a individual identifiable , to the exclusion of the behalf and of the as of a employee of a organization and of the question and number of telephone of the place of work . 
by therefore , any information regarding his health or the treatment given to a patient identifiable and all Intelligence regarding the care of health easier by a professional of the health identifiable are , by definition , a uniqueness private . 
honourable senators , the Association medical Canadian , the Association dental Canadian and of other associations representative the professionals of the health the are what very agri by the impact not that could have the bill of bill C - 6 in this who has relates to the information personal and to the other activities sensibles from to the system of health . 
as the honourable senators the know , the bill of bill is to facilitate and to promote the trade Ministerial in perpetuate the information personal collected , used or releases " in the framework of activities trade " . 
he not has not been designed in songeant to the system of health . 
in effect , I believe that well of the people not have not thought to the system of health to the time of develop this bill of bill . 
and this is this who fact that , in a some legislation - that he is difficult of determine - , the bill of bill could have a impact not on the system of health . 
same if the bill of bill is around on the activity commercial , he is obvious that . not cannot establish a distinction such between the - this and the activity linked to the care of health that the issues of health would the subject of a treatment different of the other issues . 
the subject , statement in words waves , of the part 1 of the bill of bill , and that the application to the professionals of the health working in a business which the key service is the Benefit of care of health , have of what concern . 
in what the bill of bill influera he on the treatment of the data allow to the for of the medicine preventive , of the diagnosed medical and of the research medical , on the Benefit of the care and on the management of the services of care of health ? 
honourable senators I specific . 
I believe that he is imperative of clarify the bill of bill C - 6 for satisfy to four points important . 
first , the bill of bill C - 6 must another a definition clear of the information are the applies the right of the individual to the life privacy . 
as I the I fact having , he not specific not in what legislation these provisions the apply to the information medical . 
by example , the ( 4 ( 1 ) has ) states that this bill of bill the applies to any organization to the regard of the information personal that she recueille , using or report in the framework of activities trade . 
this who is a activity commercial not is not clear defined . 
he seems that the . share of the principle that that excludes automatically the issues medical . 
however , where finit the activity commercial and where start the care of health , that not is not clear of the all . 
in addition , he not there has no line Director for the flow of the information medical between the to of health and the to commercial . 
second , the bill of bill C - 6 not protects not the information medical . 
of the rules must be completed in this who respect the information medical to of to the of their nature special . 
in particular , the bill of bill must be clarifié and amended to of include , in this who respect the information medical , of the rules specific who network the focus on the protection of the right to the life privacy and who garantiront that the information medical not be releases that on a basic selective and under the control and with the consent informed of the patient . 
in addition , any definition linked to the Clinic and to the use of the information medical should include of the information identifiables , of the information without link allowing of identify the patient , of the information anonymes and any combination of these types of information . 
of more , I like do out that a recent report of the Council Advisory of the information on the health has clear underlined that any legislation legislative to relates to the respect of the life privacy and to the protection of the information on the health " should also include of the provisions clear prevented the use commercial school of the information on the health . " 
third , not only the bill of bill C - 6 should include of the provisions specific for the information on the health , but he is also important that these provisions be colleague also to the sectors public and private . 
I recommends that these provisions be based on the framework that provides the Code of protection of the information personal on the health some and adopted by the Association medical Canadian . 
this Code could Establishing the basic of the bill gouvernant the Clinic , the use and the disclosure of the information on the health . 
fourth , the part 2 of the bill of bill C - 6 not specific not to what for the data electronic related to the care of health and to the issues medical could be used . 
of more , he not there now no rule , this who it the the met to all they of abuse . 
honourable senators , I ask your support to of ensure to this that these concerns be settled before that the bill of bill C - 6 not continue the over . 
the government has the opportunity , even the obligation , of give to the Canadians of solid rights in the of respect of the life privacy relatively to the information on the health . 
in same time , he is of a interest vital of protect the ability of transfer of the data to of the for of care of health legitimate and of encourage a better management and integration of our system of care of health . 
of this fact , the bill of bill C - 6 is a legislation legislative important and necessary . 
he is however essential that we veillions to this that she will effectively to the concerns expressed by the members of the community of the care of health . 
I believe therefore that we should try of help the government to the committee in Dolly of the changes to this bill of bill , this who in would a legislation legislative still better . 
( on the motion of the senator Kinsella , the debate is adjourned . ) 
bill of bill of 99 on the implementation in implement of conventions tax 
second Reading - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Hervieux - Hervieux , P , seconded by the hon. senator Robichaud , P ( - Acadie - Acadia ) , that the bill Bill S - 3 , Act an in implement a agreed , of the conventions and of the protocoles conclude between the Canada and the Kirghizistan , the Lebanon , the Algeria , the Bulgaria , the Portugal , the Ouzbékistan , the Jordan , the Japan and the Luxembourg , in view of avoid the duplicates Socialist and of prevent the evasion tax in the of taxes on the income , be read a second time . 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
I wish however to attention to the honourable senators a country described by this treaty and which the behaviour raises of the questions regarding the relevance for the Canada of maintain of the links with him . 
by therefore , I hope that tomorrow or when the bill of bill will before the committee of the Banking , he there will that of the officials senior of the Affairs foreign in legislation of better answer to the questions regarding the country in because . 
the country which I about is the Ouzbékistan , a of the ancient republics encroachment in Asia core . 
in a recent release in date of the 20 October , the Zinn Zinn AsiaWatch : 
... documente regardless a profile of arrest policy , of detention and of harassment of the members of the families of activists political and of dissidents church to the over of the six the months . 
he there has also many of evidence crédibles according which the police his regularly of small amount of drug or of no on of the people that she touch for their stripes political or religious . 
the steering executive of the Zinn Zinn AsiaWatch for the Europe and the Asia core has said : 
the government of the Ouzbékistan claims the prepare to to of the election free and field all in gleefully the members of the families of the Opposition on the verrous and in the débarrassant of the key . 
this not is not that a way of achieve the democracy . 
in a other release was the same day , the Zinn Zinn AsiaWatch has said : 
the schools and the universities of the Ouzbékistan say of open their doors to the musulmans to the barbe and to the women to the chador . 
according this organization : 
the government of the Ouzbékistan the they of across to the freedom religious . 
the expulsion of students musulmans is a other aspect of this campaign . 
as if that not was not enough , the government of the Canada , in his own note explicative regarding the bill of bill , said that : 
he not is not rare that the major opposed and the members of their family be held and torturés . 
the trade commercial the are élevésà 18 million of $ in 1988 . 
the Canada not has fact no Investment majeur in this country . 
no company Canadian not fact of work of and oil or mining , this who seems be the major attractions of this country . 
those who there have thought fact that this is primarily the Environment commercial ouzbek who the the to the gap . 
always according the notes of information , the companies Canadian of high Technology who have chosen of the sales in Ouzbékistan have had many of difficulty to do out the earners foreign of this country . 
according the data available , he seems that this not be not the a of the regions the more prometteuses for the investors Canadian . 
each time that he has had case to a regime répressif not to not the intention of favouring a minimum of democracy , the Canada has always taken Position , be by of the sanctions or by a boycottage whatever . 
since he there has well little of commitment between the Ouzbékistan and the Canada , I not see not why we should adopt a such treaty to the time current . 
I hope that the committee will in legislation of proof the contrary or to all the least that he the tighten on the question because , to least that . me proves the need of a such treaty for the protection of a good number of Canadians on the plan of the taxes , by example , I believe that he would appropriate of propose a amendment who retrancherait the treaty of the bill of bill and the garderait to the gap also long that necessary . 
can - be the regime ouzbek imagine he that the Canada is really seriously when he canada the rights of the human and the democracy and that he not fact not that repeat the words of the other .

I me remind that he there has few months to only , we we been before of a bill of bill similar who has been referred to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
a sure number of questions , separate of those of the senator Lynch - Lynch , had also been raised then . 
why this bill of bill will he referred to the committee of the Banking to the place of the committee of the Affairs foreign , as this was the case , he me seems , of bills of bill precedents on of the conventions tax ?

the speech of the Throne 
motion of Adopted of the Adresse in response - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator MLA , seconded by the hon. senator Furey , Honourable to the Adopted of a Adresse to His Excellency the Gouverneure general in response to the speech that her has given during of the opening of the second session of the 30 - sixth Parliament . - 
( 4e day of the resuming of the debate . ) 
the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I I had until to now the happy - my faith , yes , the most of the time the happy - of hear 11 speech of the Throne , as to the Parliament provincial that here same , to the Senate . 
that they have been speeches here or in my province proud of the Manitoba , they affichaient all the same over . 
they were all a little waves . 
he must understand that , of by their nature same , the speech of the Throne are rather waves . 
they are refreshed of talk words , but avares of details . 
I I always éprouvé a some compassion for the Gouverneurs worry and the lieutenants - Governors who must read these speech . 
however , the present speech of the Throne me has profoundly affected by places because that he establishes a new program , a program for the children . 
he is very well that I about of that today today because , as the has out Thursday last the senator Callbeck , we we celebrated the Day national of the child Saturday last , the 20 November . 
as the know the senators , in 1993 , the government federal has appropriately the 20 November Day national of the child to of Calgarians two events historic of the UN , to know the Adopted , the 20 November 1959 , of the Declaration of the rights of the child and the Adopted , the 20 November 1989 , of the Convention Current to the rights of the child . 
the young of today today are the leaders of tomorrow . 
for ensure to our children the better departure possible in the life , we must invest now in the future , in their future . 
the experience and the research scientific indicate that the Prime development of a child submit the success to the age adulthood . 
, the below of the new millennium , we must see to this that our children have the Paralympians and the benefits necessary for that our society be robust and prosperous . 
the children have need of our love , of our support and of our your , but they have also need of opportunities for learn . 
their needs basic must be satisfied . 
more earlier this after - afternoon , I lisais a speech of the senator Gill on the aboriginal to the Canada . 
this is tragic , but the needs basic of the children aboriginal are rarely satisfied . 
in 1989 , all the parties represented to the House of the Commons have adopted a resolution to the Elimination of the poverty home the children before the year 2000 . 
as the senator Cohen the knows , we are in November 99 and , unfortunately , we we taken of the backsliding by report to 1989 . 
however , I hope that , through to this speech of the Throne and to the budget who the in just , the legislators will do of the progress to this regard . 
of any obviously , we not modernized not our objective for the year 2000 , but he must hope that we entamerons the millennium of the good at . 
the poverty one all the aspects of the development of a child , also well to short that to long term . 
that starts in the within of the mother , with a bad nutrition , and the on all to the long of the years of training , affectant all the aspects of the growth and nuisant to the success . 
. not can the expect to this that a child which the needs basic - food , housing and Clothing appropriate - not are not satisfied can learn and the épanouir . 
of more in more , the programs of assistance social of the provinces motions the beneficiaries across to the Canada to accept of the work up . 
I not me against not to this that the people work a work who their is . 
I believe that that is beneficial for the image of itself and for the own development . 
however , if , in every the people to work , we not we préoccupons not of the care to give to the children , who will it ? 
I know who will losing . 
the children will losers . 
these families will 17,500 the statistics and the recipients social from of the workers those . 
in our planning , we must absolutely give the priority to the quality of the care to give to these children . 
nowhere share to the Canada the salary minimum not is enough high for allow same to those who have a employment to time full of wrestled to the poverty . 
, Winnipeg , in 99 , according a report recent of the Council national of the well - be social , a parent only who has a only child should work 80 p.m. by week for , to the below of the poverty the he has a employment up to the salary minimum . 
, Winnipeg , for a family who the two parents and two children , he would 118 p.m. of work by week for , to the below of poverty . 
honourable senators , he not there has that 168 p.m. in a week . 
the credit of tax for children , a magnificent program the on at by the government , has unfortunately been interpretation in some provinces as a system who their allowed of reduce the benefits of assistance social . 
the program has therefore improved the fate of the poor who working , but he not has not reports the income of the recipients social . 
the children have always need of their parents . 
some of between we we asking same if our children adults not have not always need of we . 
this is why of the programs as the Program of assistance préscolaire to the aboriginal , the Program Canadian of nutrition prénatale and the Program of action community for the children have all been essential for look the basis of a widest development to long term home the children . 
I I been very pleased of find in the speech of the Throne seven commitments to the about of the children : of the benefits more generous for the congés of motherhood and parentaux , a agreed federal - provincial for better support the development of the young children , a increase of the income after tax of the families , of the as of work more conviviaux for the families , including in the Administration public federal , the modernization of the right family , a third injected of funds important in the Benefit national for children and the strengthening of the opportunities of learning through to a expansion of Rescol . 
honourable senators , the statement budget not is not the hall , but , if I dentist Paul Martin to prepare the budget , the families poor who working would right to all the cuts of tax . 
all these initiatives are urgently , honourable senators . 
in particular , the speech of the Throne announced of the congés parentaux améliorés through to the extension of the period of the benefits parentales paid by the regime of insurance - employment . 
we want can - be study of the changes in this sense to the regime of insurance - employment . 
for the time , concentrons - we however on the congés parentaux . 
he the is that of a initiative very positive , but I hope that , when government the will , he will the of the fact that the parents of today today are loans to share the responsibility . 
these congés not are not services only to the women . 
the Fathers have a opportunity wonderful of benefit of the congés parentaux . 
however , with the bill current on the insurance - employment , if the mother and the father want benefit of the break , each of the two would a period of Awaiting of two weeks . 
this is unfortunate because that , personally , I like that more of Fathers Canadian taking the home in with , same during of disappear periods . 
personally , when I I should to six weeks to the Hospital to the time of the birth of my second child , the aînée not could not me visit and she and the father the are many rapprochés because that this was particularly him who the was of she . 
the after - afternoon , when the chariot of friandises was , I achetais a bookshelf of chocolat for my daughter and I the him écrivais a letter in he , because she not had that three years , and I him was to by the father , who is became the parent favourite during this period . 
I not I known that a little after my return to the home that they mangeaient the bookshelf of chocolat together in our reads before the at . 
but what that he in be , to the over of this period particular of his life , my husband is became very with to my daughter aînée and their collusive duration still today today . 
the small boyhood is a period criticism for the good development of the child , as to short that to long term . 
the children who have of the experience positive to the over of their small boyhood are better to the school , they have a better believe of them - same and they are better adaptés to the life in society . 
more later in their life , they have of best jobs , least of problems social and least of problems of health . 
they are least may of have of the babies to the tumultuous , they drink least of Substances and they are least may of into in the youth . 
that we surprend - he really ? 
take the case of a small daughter or of a small star of five years typical who between to the tongue . 
this is can - be his first or second experience of the school . 
in the case of children of the class average , even of a family poor Telecommunication of appropriate skills parentales - yes , he there in has - , when they of to the tongue , they with their behalf , where they live , their number of telephone , they found the alphabet , the Toronto and the figures . 
these children are to a time criticism of the learning , the more important the the learning of the Reading . 
Comparez that to the children who not are not the figures , or the alphabet , or the Toronto . 
as the departure , as the beginning of the classes , a group of children is disadvantaged by report to a other . 
this is why the intervention in the first boyhood is if important for that we can reversing the trend of the opportunities for these children - that . 
according a study that I I called recently , 28p. per of the boys lead a behaviour antisocial concerning in tongue were offenders to the age of 13 years , 28p. per of between them ! 
this is why a program of action national for the children is if important . 
the promise of the government of work with the provinces and the territories to the implementation in implement of a plan of action of here December 2000 for strengthen the development of the first boyhood is essential . 
the program of action national for the children - a initiative federal , provincial and land - sharing number of objectives of the Day national of the child . 
they designed the same message . 
in working together , the Canadians can the ensure that all the children live in a climate of love and of understanding , that they be which as of the people and that they have the opportunity of achieve their full potential when they will adults . 
in the speech of the Throne is also announced Échanges Canada , a program to to give to per $ young each year the opportunity of live and of study in of other regions of the Canada . 
what wonderful experience ! 
I am a better CIBC because that I I lived in several regions of the country , and I know that my children the are also because that they have lived also in several provinces and that they are capable of speak the two languages official of the Canada . 
not forget not also the programs as Katimavik . 
honourable senators , to the over of the ten next days , a group of these young we make visit on the Hill , and I you urge to speak to some of between them . 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
I am sorry of interrupt the hon. senator , but the time of speak is expired . 
the senator Carstairs : 
then - I have the leave of continue , honourable senators ? 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
the leave is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Carstairs : 
thank , honourable senators . 
these young who are Treaty by Katimavik not are not of the young very as for to go to the university . 
this are of the young who not know not too this that they will do . 
however , I can you say , after the have met to the over of the years , that after a year to the within of the program Katimavik , this are of the young very as who have learned our two languages official , who have worked to of the bills of services community to the Canada and who have now of the bills for their future . 
this is this that he must encourage to the Canada . 
honourable senators , in the speech of the Throne , the government has also renewed the commitment of present to new a bill on the young Offenders . 
in fact , the Minister of the Justice has already presented to new the bill of bill under the along C - 3 . 
I will examine this bill of bill very carefully for ensure to this that we not we not too get . 
let - me of quote a report of the 20 June 1995 of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional to the about of the bill of bill C - 37 , amend the Act on the young Offenders , part 1 : 
several witnesses have used that he was contrebalancer the concerns legitimate of the public to the regard of the violence home the adolescents with of the information greatest on the rate of youth and on the operating of the system of justice for the young . 
the committee believes that or the young or the great public not have interest to this that be véhiculées of the inexactitudes on the fréquence of the crimes with violence made by of the adolescents of same that on the wide of the actions . 
these report inaccurate can significant of the fears not based and own the people to from of the measures of more in more punitives , little may of do people the causes hands of the crimes with violence made by of the young . 
. does constantly say that the rate of the youth home the young is to the increase - this is the refrain sir to the members Reform - , that the young are of more in more violent and that of the measures more strict the do because that the bill current on the young Offenders is too low . 
however , honourable senators , according a recent publication of the Service Correctional of the Canada to on of the data of the Centre Canadian of the statistics legal , in the together , the number of young who have been charged of a offence criminal and who have appeared before a court for adolescents has decreased between 1992 and 1997 . 
when . consider the crimes violent made by of the young to the the national , . not be that a lightly increase . 
the transfers of young to the courts for adults not have or increased or decreased . 
finally , the most of the provisions to the regard of the young has increased ; contrary to the perception to the within of the people , the sentences , to the young are far of be clémentes . 
according a study that I I called recently , the only average put to a young to made a crime was Superior to the put to a adulthood for the same offence . 
however , to the Manitoba , the three quarters of the members of bands not are not of the young , this are of the adults . 
honourable senators , the Canada does of the children in other to a rate two time higher to the one in the most of the States of the States - United , who have the rate of incarceration the more high of all the Troops as that in this who respect the adults that the young . 
in , , he not there has that 10 boys seniors of least of 18 years in other , and this , on a people of five million of people . 
, the Canada , he there has 4 $ young in detention on a people of 31 million of people . 
believes - . really that our young are six time and half more nasty that the young of , ? 
in Norway , he not there has more of other for children . 
honourable senators , of 30 to 70 per of the young Offenders are affligés of a type whatever of difficulty of learning . 
, the place of durcir the legislation legislative regarding the young Offenders , we should money of the resources to to solve the problems of the people in difficulty of learning during that they are young . 
the research indicate that the children who benefit of care and of a education of high quality as their young age are - many least many that the other to be CANBAT to of the crimes and to of the actions of violence , that this be as victims or as perpetrators . 
the Council national of prevention of the crime has recommended of lead the fight against the youth in would in Prime place of good programs social for the children . 
honourable senators , to the beginning of my remarks , I I mentioned that this was Saturday the tenth anniversary of the Adopted of the Convention of the Nations Nations Current to the rights of the child . 
the convention with of the rights of the children and of the young of least of 18 years . 
she recognizes also the role important of the family in the education of the children . 
before the convention of 1989 , in under of the right international , a child was considered as a subject which he was give of the care and of the protection . 
the convention has amended this perception in grateful the rights of the child as human , and in him easier the right to the freedom of expression , of association , of meeting , of religion and of the life privacy . 
the Canada fact the subject of criticism to the the international since 1989 for have out of repeal the clause 43 of the Code criminal , who between in conflict with the clause 19 of the Convention of the Nations Nations . 
in 1995 , the committee of the rights of the child of the Nations Nations has recommended that the punishment punishment to the home or , be avenues and has asked that the Canada review the clause 43 to the light of this recommendation . 
I am déçue of see that he not is not fact says of the endangers of the clause 43 in the speech of the Throne . 
the media have announced yesterday that the Minister of the Justice will this week of the changes to the Code criminal to of protect more the animals against the actions of violence and the abuse . 
the changes are for to recognize in right that the animals not are not a well and that they exist in as that such . 
the children are of the people unique . 
they have need of our love , of our support and , by - that all , of our advice . 
the children have need of discipline , but he there has many of other ways of appeals a child that of approach to of the punishment punishment . 
in reality , of the studies have revealed that the punishment punishment there more , and not least , of violence . 
the government the oriente in the good direction . 
any legislation who is to protect our children and to encourage their full francophone and the too of their potential is a legislation positive . 
as a good teacher , I will to a reports of notes to this about . 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
I I heard speak of the measures that the government claims take for improve the life of the aboriginal , of the women and of the Canadians disabilities , but I I had a listen the more carefully possible , I not I nothing heard to the about of the fourth group : the of the Canadians owned to a minority visible . 
this is as if we were hearted of the world , of the least the world such that the government present the contemplated . 
I not I however not been surprised . 
the minorities visible not have never really figuré in the priorities of the government . 
we not do not part of this that the Prime Minister Order pompeusement the vision Liberal of the new millennium . 
I think that that the ask by the fact that , contrary to the women , we not attirons not the attention of the simple fact of our great number . 
we not helps not not more of feelings of about as the people disabilities . 
we not are not the point of mire of the media as the aboriginal . 
, the place of that , he seems that we are simply that in as that black , Chinese , Vietnamiens , Indian of the Indes orientales , Pakistanais , Nigérians , Sénégalais , voters , Libanais , Nicaraguayens , Boliviens , and cetera . 
we are a group hétérogène of individuals became of all the regions of the world . 
we are a group of individuals among which good number working for the adapt to their new land of reaction while that of many other are here since a century or more ; we estate all to of the minorities who trying of overcome the various forms of racism , of partisanship and of intolerance which they are opposite in their daily . 
he seems that no of between we not is dignified of a attention particular or not seems we the less in of interest or of consideration of the share of the government . 
given given this indifference inexplicable and inexcusable , he is of my duty of take the speak in this chamber today today . 
he has left a part small but Maritimer of our community not ; and without Senators . 
I rise therefore the speak , during a short time , to of speak of the case of the minorities visible before the Senate . 
honourable senators , I like remind to the government that the members of the minorities visible are also of the citizens of our wonderful country . 
in despite of the difference of the colour of their peau , of the form of their " , of their focus or of their customs , they are part integral of our great family Canadian . 
he not must not the overlooked or their be of ways , as . the has clearly fact in the speech of the Throne . 
according the the surveys , 32p. per of the people of Toronto are of the members of minorities visible , all as 31p. per of the people of Vancouver , 15 per of the people of Calgary , 12 per of the people of Montreal and 7 per of the people of Halifax . 
, the over of the next years , these figures will still increase . 
statistics Canada for that he there will someone 7 million of members of minorities visible to the Canada in 2016 . 
if such is the case , they will 20 per of the people Canadian . 
in despite of their number always growing , the members of the minorities visible are widely held to the gap of the flot Main of the society . 
honourable senators , look around of you . 
the minorities visible are 11 per of our people . 
are - they 11 per of the Senate or of the House of the Commons ? 
and that in is - he in the forces Armed , the order judicial or the industry bancaire ? 
how of chairmen of university know - you who be members of minorities visible ? 
how the fact - he that the CBC not seems not find of members of minorities visible for take share to his many shows of discussion and to his many shows of experts . 
how that the fact - he , in effect ? 
the exclusion of members of minorities visible of their fair share of the jobs is a phenomenon who one all the sectors of our society . 
the service public of the Canada in is a excellent example . 
the Department of the Defence national the least of 500 members of minorities visible on a total de17 $ employees civilians , and the Service Correctional of the Canada in the to only 300 among his 12 $ employees . 
the situation is still more disgraceful to the Affairs senior . 
honourable senators , least of 3 per of the does of the service public of the Canada are members of minorities visible . 
. me said that , to the exception of the people appointments by ascertain , he not there has , in any the service public , no under - Minister member of a minority visible . 
in fact , the last would taken his retirement he there has two decades ! 
that . there think . 
he there has surely more of per under - ministers in the service public , and they are all of race one ! 
other said , no of the more of 9 $ members of minorities visible that I I mentioned he there has a moment not has the qualities required for become under - Minister . 
not a only of between them not has the education , the experience and the know - do for exercise these duties . 
this is difficult to believe ! 
however , this not is not a question of time ; this is a question of attitude . 
be the leaders of the service public of the Canada believe in the equity in the of employment , be they not there believe not . 
well one , the given their record , I not think not that they there believe . 
honourable senators , the service public not is not the only to refuse of open his doors to the members of minorities visible . 
the same situation " in our own court . 
take a minute for reflect to the last time where we we seen a employee of the Senate who was part of a minority visible . 
if you are as me , this minute could in become two or three . 
the fact is that , according the office of the Clerk , only 1,2p. per of the employees of the Senate are members of minorities visible . 
that represents a total of six people on 6,401 employees , in a institution who is supposed help to give the example to of other . 
I refers these two institutions as examples , but he there in has well of other . 
the real problem , according me , this is that in not Futures not , . heritage the idea that he not is not necessary of act . 
in of other words , . the said that if . not fact nothing , the problem disparaîtra of him - same . 
honourable senators , we we already seen , with the referendum to the Quebec and today today , with the fishing on the Coast is , that a such approach not led that to of the problems . 
. refuses to the minorities visible of the opportunities field in the of employment . 
we should in speak , obtain the opinion of the these and find of the ways of overcome the problem . 
argue that that not there not not rule nothing ; yet , this is exactly this that we do . 
the same something the happened in the area of the relations picnic . 
the Canadians unhappy to believe to wrong that they live in a country more compassionate . 
he not there has not of émeutes picnic here . 
the assassins not abattent not of the leaders of the communities minority . 
the black not are not sought to death or almost by of the bands of policiers the long of a road or agressés sexually in the wards of bain of the positions of police . 
all the world the does and he there has of the space for all . 
the only problem with that , this is that this not is not true . 
the Canada not is not a Arcadie of the era modern ; this not is not true not more that all the Canadians unhappy their next . 
in fact , very often , the love fact place to the animosity , to the confidence , to the fear and to the haine , yes , the haine . 
of the crimes as by the haine are made to the Canada , same if , fortunately , this not is not to the same the that to the States - United . Quoi that he in be , that the happened . 
she has been battue and noyée . 
why ? 
because that she was member of a minority visible . 
we we of the groups sectaires to the Canada also : the Ku Klux Klan , the White Power Canada , the Nationalist Party of Canada and the Heritage Front . 
the newspapers and the television not speak virtually not of the question . 
why ? 
because that the majority of the Canadians not are not these . 
for the white , the equity in the of employment , the racism and the crimes as by the haine are of the questions intellectuelles rather that practices and that the includes . 
in effect , the white are rarely of the targets . 
honourable senators , the minorities visible not at not a treatment Special . 
they not looking not of think who are refusées to of other . 
they want work , have of the jobs rémunérateurs , rise their children in a Environment course , their give the possible of have a life healthy and prosperous , as all the world . 
as the other , they want be accepted for this that they are and that the . not é not the of their country of origin or of the colour of their peau . 
we we personally fact enough of progress these last decades for that that be possible . 
can - be am - I still that too honourable . 
honourable senators , I I fact to the beginning of the year a speech on the situation of the community has to the Canada . 
in my remarks , I I said that I doutais very that we arrivions really to the equality of my living . 
after this speech , someone a is come me ask why I continuais to defend my ideas when , in my for within , I not thought not that the things s change . 
I I answered that I not had not really the choice . 
this is a responsibility that I accept welcome in despite of the reserves that I can have . 
honourable senators , that he me be for of have few reserves . 
let - me of in douter . 
I be that of the stereotypes negative remain to this day in the society Canadian and in the media to the regard of the minorities visible . 
the access to some jobs rest subrepticement deduct . 
the members of the minorities visible continue of the do deal of nègres , of chinetoques , of sleazy Pakistanais , and of asiates . 
I not am therefore not sure that the things have indeed many changed . 
the response not is not in a bill of bill - this is obvious . 
we we the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms , the Act Canadian on the rights of the human and the Act on the citizenship Canadian . 
yet , the prejudice and the racism remain . 
the Reform would senior and very that the minorities visible should be reléguées to the back - plan , hides . 
the Administration public federal employ many too little of minorities visible , to the been that . not cannot fairer a bill of this dispute . 
of the members of groups sectaires now regularly of the documents CAIP Honourable to significant the intolerance Discrimination and ethnic , the violence and well of other feelings hostile . 
honourable senators , the real solution to the problem of the racism and of the prejudice ahead in the education and the trade . 
the people must learn to the know . 
they must reliance their anxieties versus . 
for that , he their must of the information . 
this is the information who allows of eliminate the insinuations and the stereotypes . 
she establishes of the links between the members of the community and promote a better understanding . 
however , the information to she only not can deal all the problems . 
he must there have a commitment . 
he must that all be convinced that the minorities visible have right to all the benefits of the citizenship . 
this is that who is to the heart of the problem . 
I believe that he up in part to the government federal of promote this commitment . 
a part of his responsibility is to we driver , in as that country , to the harmony and the respect linked . 
this is to the government of tracer the been to follow . 
however , he not the fact not . 
the Prime Minister and the cabinet have decided of not not to the of the question of the minorities visible . 
they are as if she not there not . 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
honourable senators , I regret of duty interrupt the hon. senator , but the time of speak is expired . 
would - he the leave of continue ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Oliver : 
thank , honourable senators . 
their problems not deserve not our attention . 
find of the solutions for eliminate the racism , the inégalités and the discrimination , this not is not a priority national . 
of any obviously , I not can be of agreed with this attitude , and this is this Opposition who me value to speak to the Senate today today . 
in ending , honourable senators , I say that if the government not to not the deal to this question , we could the do here . 
seen the diversity of the knowledge and the rich experience of the senators , I am am that a debate on the place of the minorities visible to the Canada current place to of asset evidence . 
if we pocket then continue the study of the question , a under - committee of the committee of the Affairs Social could be up to this effect . 
the mandate could another a tour of the country during which he recueillerait and compilerait the opinions the more to day on the employment to the within of the minorities visible . 
. could also form a committee Joint of the House of the Commons and of the Senate for ensure a followed to the findings of the committee Daudlin of 1984 . 
you you recall that this committee had examined the participation of the minorities visible to the life of the society Canadian . 
what that be the road empruntée , honourable senators , we not must not follow the example of the government in still nothing . 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , I wish to congratulate the senators who have presented and seconded the motion of Adopted of the Adresse in response to the speech of the Throne because they have all two spoke with eloquence to the behalf of their provinces and regions . 
the funding of the research and the method chosen for ensure this funding can have a impact on the vitality same of a country and determine the future of the economy and of the system of health , and that the well - be of his citizens . 
well that I am satisfied of the speech of the Throne , I wish to comment briefly a of his gaps . 
this is this that the price Nobel John Polanyi was the " marketing of the science " . 
during of a recent remarks before the Corporation Royal , he has criticized this trend in stand that she crumbling the universities Canadian and value the more brilliant scientific of the country to the forced . 
he would could add that this trend contributes also to the collapse of the service public who was , to a time given , more centrée on the better interest of the consumers and of the people that on the concerns of the companies . 
the exemplars of the price Nobel the in is taken to the policy of funding of the research of the governments federal and provincial , who have fact of the universities of the for of the industry . 
the Canada is went too far , has he said , in their the research industrialisée to the expense of the research systémique or fundamental . 
the drain to the States - United of scientific and of researchers of Prime plan is also the result , of the least in part , of this policy little preview because , enough strangely , the States - United the are held to distance of this industrialisation of the research . 
, the States - United , only 6 per of the research university are underfunded by the sector private . 
I hope that the initiative announced in the speech of the Throne to the regard of the Instituts of research in health will a change of the values on this point . 
the farmers have 14.6 this year of the Hempline records or almost . 
in Saskatchewan only , they have happened 27,8 million of tonnes of grain , of oléagineux and of crops special . 
and yet , their earner - their and their way of life are peril in part if completely because that the grants federal have been reduced to a U.S.A. of this that the governments European and American limited to their own producers céréaliers . 
the Canada not subventionne not these producers agricultural . 
if the silence of the speech of the Throne was cruel , the response of the government to the crisis in the weeks who have followed évoquait the " silence of the agneaux " . 
the first ministers of the Manitoba and of the Saskatchewan , who are came to Ottawa , have been sommairement claimants . 
the Minister federal of the Agriculture has announced that a amount Supplementary of 170 million of $ would added to the Program of assistance in case of disaster linked to the income agricultural , phase called ACRA . 
this figure represents least of 15 per of this that the first ministers of the Manitoba and of the Saskatchewan those necessary . 
this spring , the government does has administration 79 million of $ for come in assistance to the farmers victims of floods . 
he said now that he not is not in legislation of be his quote - share . 
the Saskatchewan find also the arrangement impraticable and think to the withdraw of the program ACRA . 
same if the provinces could help still more , the problem , this is that to the obviously , the program ACRA is far of be to the up . 
in date of the 25 October , the program not had déboursé that 227 million of $ , be least of 13 per of this that the Minister what of legislation of assistance of 1,78 billion of $ . 
as he has been already mentioned in this chamber , more of the half of the requests made by the people of the Manitoba and of the Saskatchewan have been provided . 
is this that Morris Dorasch said to this comments in Agri - enriching : 
when he pays , the program ACRA offer a funding to the bad people , for the bad reasons and of the bad way . 
I like repeating a point who has been raised to the over of the debate of emergency . 
the farmers must obtain of the money before ë . 
the they not in get not , they not will not in legislation of ensemencer to the spring . 
this is also simple that that . 
. can their offer of the assistance of all they of ways , that this be by the the of the income net , the taxes or the reduction legislative of the rates of transportation that the farmers must pay and who should , of after of the studies , be down of to the least 5 $ the would . 
the Minister of the Finance we has confirmed that the money not lack not . 
the problem the find therefore to the level of the will policy . 
this is why the agencies of the Western trying of persuade the Prime Minister of come see by him - same the consequences of this crisis in by visit to the sectors agricultural of the Western . 
he has right to the same protection of the share of the government of the Canada that the other producers get in of other country with which he is in competition . 
today today , our producers of Wheat get least of the third of the grants which from their competitors in Europe . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate has criticized to the provinces of refuse of help more to the program ACRA . 
I must do out that to the States - United also well that in Europe , this is the level the more high of government who funding the grants . 
no state American not offer of programs of grants agricultural who vaillent the only of be mentioned . 
the superbudget of the Union European is the who the applies to the grants agricultural . 
of the thousands of farmers and their families are forced of leave the land , and . we said that this is the consequential inexorable of the progress technologique , but the industrialisation in this sector not is not inexorable and not is not a progress . 
the time is can - be come for the farmers of express their own message durum . 
buy of the intrants who are increase the production and the revenues of the Canada in earners foreign through to the exports , but not the income net of the farmers , this is a bad case who not would no value to the initiatives and to the with of the farmers . 
the problem of the family agricultural is summary in a clause that I I received recently of my intrépide Leader . 
I like in read a a : 
until to all recently , the most of the people in the world were nourris by the grandchildren farmers who head various foods of basic for trigger the communities local and the markets local . 
but with the rules of the WTO , the grandchildren farmers by . 
in a great part of the world ( there including to the States - United ) , of the companies international have taken in with of other elements of the agriculture and use many of products chemical and now the biotechnologie . 
the small hailed have yielding the place to of immense rivers of monocultures of luxury the to the export . 
and all this transportation of substantially food détériore the Environment . 
all this transportation of foods by at , by truck or by of to the four across of the world fact increase the consumption of energy , worsening the pollution of the Oceans and of the would and contributes to the changes issues ... ... ... . 
he must more of emballages , this who system a more great and of the Forestry . 
he must of new infrastructure . 
and , of any way , the foods products industriellement are least shaped , are of the products chemical who polluent the soil and the water and pose of the problems of health public . 
by therefore , not not protect the and agricultural , this is responsiveness a resources valuable . 
of , , the and agricultural not is more small . 
, the Canada , she can do of 10 $ to 20 $ hectares . 
the senator Carstairs has spoke with many of eloquence of the Program of action national for the children and of the importance of the education in the small boyhood . 
I him say simply that , if she to propose a new time a amendment to the Code criminal on the punishment punishment , I be pleased of support a such amendment . 
when I at to the board school , to the Manitoba , we we eliminated these punishment in the regulation . 
let - me of say a word to the about of other elements of the program who not the concrétiseront can - be not quickly . 
and , in June 1997 and during the campaign election , he has been said that a new government Liberal établirait of the centres of excellence for ensure the well - be of the children and débloquerait a funding of 20 million of $ on five years . 
a Hamani of months more later , no centre not has still been the on at . 
the question of the garderies is still more important . 
I like speak of two reports recent for we remind why we not must not overlooked the services of Custody and why we we need of a system national . 
the Prime , and the senator Carstairs there has fact referring , this are the new evidence neuroscientifiques who recommend that the three first years of life of the child have of the impact on his ability of learning , the behaviour and his health during any his life . 
not not give to the child a good departure in the life , this is this who creates the real deficit of the grise to the Canada , not the drain of the drain . 
second , the report fact an that the investment public in the programs the ability to the very young children are also important that the investment in the education resource , school and Superior and in the health . 
third , the report establishes that the communities are very effectively to integrate the programs provincial and federal to the level local . 
this report , as many of other before him , remind to the leaders political that , the they négligent the services of Custody , they the are to the risk of the society . 
he ask to the government federal of investir3,5 billion of $ in a system national of garderies of quality and affordable in partnership with the parents and the governments provincial and territorial . 
that update a such Investment ? 
according the report : 
of many programs social would the families , but the services of Custody constitute the armature of all these programs . 
the services of Custody are the program who recoupe to the time the security of the income and the services . 
. has demonstrated to again occasions that the services of Custody are the part essential of the participation of the parents , particularly of the mothers , to the people active . 
the improvement of the participation of the mothers to the people active is essential if the . to reduce the poverty act . 
Michael McCracken , of Infometrica , is went still more far and has seemed the number of jobs " be created . 
a reduction of a billion of $ of the taxes on the income of the special characterized approximativement 9 $ jobs to the cost of 96 $ $ by employment . 
a billion of $ spent to the services of Custody characterized 46 $ jobs to a cost of 8 higher $ by employment . 
this is of , a calculating enough sad because that he shows that the workers of garderies not than not enough sir . 
however , this are that of the facts bruts . 
the journalist Linda McQuaig we said that Health Canada has public a bill of program national of garderies . 
however , he seems that the government of the Canada not fail not this program with many of into and that he not in fact not the promotion . 
of more , he not is not fact says in the speech of the Throne of the protection of the health of the children against the threats Environmental . 
let - me of you give a example . 
we know that the incinérateurs municipal , some industries and the people who are brûler of the lumber treaty émettent of the dioxines in the Environment . 
we know that of the trace of this substance arsenal very Unleash the find in our foods . 
there still , . in find in the milk maternel to of the levels forty time senior to the does in a steak . 
a opportunity in however the is introduced , course , to the over of the debate on the bill of bill C - 32 , for ensure to this that the dioxines be phase bannies and convince the municipalities , the governments provincial and the businesses of amend their process equity . 
the government has also missed the opportunity of do evidence of leadership in négociant a treaty international of shut of the dioxines to that the Canadians be protected against the transportation atmosphérique on of long disappear of the dioxines and of other products chemical persistent . 
however , he not is not too later - . can always act . 
in the speech of the Throne , he is said that of the measures will taken on the pesticides . 
these measures the are expect since long , because he there now someone 6 $ products advanced who are registered to the Canada . 
however , as the Auditor General the has underlined , no given not is recueillie on the use of the pesticides and we not know not not more what are all their ingrédients , because only the ingrédients active must be formally registered , then that the huiles or solvants toxic used as other components two Unauthorized . 
the effects of the pesticides on the children not are not mesurés . 
only the effects on the adults the are . 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
I regret of interrupt the senator , but the time of speak is expired . 
the senator Spivak : 
then - I complete my comments , honourable senators ? 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
is - this of agreed , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Spivak : 
he not the is that that of few - few of the gaps of the Act on the products antiparasitaires of 1969 , who is seriously dépassée . 
he there has five years , the government has the public the " book mauve " , in which he has proposed a new system regulatory , grateful the conflict of interests inherent of Agriculture Canada , who is to the time as this and as body of regulatory of the products antiparasitaires . 
the power of regulatory has been transféré to the Minister of the Health . 
five years more later , no bill not has still been introduced . 
as the say T . S . Eliot , can - . the expect to this that nothing not come the warring between the of and the action ? 
fact ironic , if the government has recognized the conflict of interest who there to the level of the pesticides , he refuses of see the conflict of interest who there to the level of the questions of the security food and of the Environment . 
the Agency Canadian of inspection of the foods , by example , promotrice of the biotechnologie , the is appropriately in situation of conflict when she the is seen give , by the bill of bill C - 32 , the responsibility of the assessment of the impact on the Environment of the manipulation they of the plantes and of the animals . 
this was logical the role of Environment Canada . 
the other question which I like speak briefly , this is the of the change climate . 
the speech of the Throne said that the government told with the other levels of government for respect the commitment taken by our country to Kyoto . 
for those who would need that . the their remind , the commitment taken to Kyoto was a way for the country , there including the Canada , who not had not respected the commitments taken to Rio of save the opposite . 
is close of a decade that the country have agreed of reduce the shows of gas to effect of Greenhouse and the Canada , between other country , not has still established no plan . 
this that I want say is very simple . 
the cost of the damage occur by the disasters natural in the world double all the five to ten years . 
in 1960 , they the chiffraient to least of 10 billion of $ by year . 
, present , they the chiffrent to more of 70 billion . 
the year last , the companies of assurance to the Canada have should pay 1.5 billion of $ . 
the hon. Grimard Grimard : 
I I led my career of lawyer in Abitibi . 
I me am same mesuré , during of a election federal , and that for my more great they , to Gilles , the son of Réal , as . the was all that - there . 
today today , he rest 38 days before of open the champagne that many dégusteront the 31 December for fêter , to midnight , the a in a other century and a other millennium . 
yet , the fruit imported of the States - United to biggest price , who garniront the plateau , recall to several that they not can more taxing as that before to the outside of the country . 
in effect , the dollar Canadian has descended of the third of his value since the years 70 , which a good part during the three last years . 
the employees ordinary are fellows in $ Canadian . 
their they , who exporting more to the States - United , voyagent . 
during that the property - fortunate benefit , the grandchildren are to the regime because their salary worth 50 under for each dollar win by the Americans , and they must pay 7.13 $ for each of their worth in from of the States - United . 
I know that the . will me say : " Tu just of the Abitibi . 
well well , not ! Ban a side , he not is not question of saturer the market artificiellement of earners . 
but of the other , I note that the speech of the Throne not made nothing to those who the concerned of the health of our dollar . 
the government not seems hardly the énerver . 
the year last , the Prime Minister the restricting to declare that this not is not serious if the people Canadian not can the to to the States - United , since they of to the New - Brunswick . 
I am well in favour of the Canadians people home them of first . 
I acknowledge that a economy well managed starts by itself - same , but I wish to say that I not like not not more the resources of résignation who is to say that if the Canadians can go to the New - Brunswick or , to this the - that , across , to the Canada , they not have not to the concern . 
what inspiration and what vigour find . in the speech of the Throne ? - response is simple : of the parcels and of the miettes . 
for in create , he would reduce the taxes . 
however , each time that the . about the Prime Minister and his ministers to this comments , they find always of the reasons for delay the time of act . 
, the contrary , the Canada tolère a rate of unemployment high by report to the of our seat of the south , a burden tax accablant , a disette of households and a absence of jobs for the young . 
comble of all , our drain the more drama émigrent to the States - United for two reasons : of the best salaries , because that fellows in money American , and least of taxes to pay . 
he there has also of many drain foreign who say of work to the Canada for the same reasons . 
Peter C . MLA , a great writer and observer learned , has wrote during of the decades on the economy Canadian . 
in a clause released in the branch Affairs of the Ottawa Citizen du17 November 99 , Mr. MLA has said that the chairman of Newbridge Networks , John Roth , had reason when he has said recently that the rate of tax on the income of the special in into to the Canada cause the drain to the States - United of the academic the more competent and brilliant of our country . 
Mr. . MLA has said that , in the last number of the Ivey Business Journal of the Scopus of Western Ontario , John Roth has comparé this loss to the of Gretzky of the high Technology . 
who more is , ENAP Roth , only 28 of the 400 does senior of Newbridge live to the Canada . 
honourable senators , you you certainly received yesterday , all as me , a release of the Cercle national of the journalists , for we announce that the which I just of you speak , John Roth , chairman and Leader of the direction of Newbridge Networks , will a conference Wednesday , the 1 December 99 , to Ottawa . 
the theme of his conference is the following : " Pourquoi the Canada loses he not only his more great talents and his positions the better paid , but also his leaders of leadership of the industry ? " 
therefore , on a sure plan , the government répand a half - truth . 
we vendons 85 per of our exports to the States - United and a dollar low we advantage to this level . 
but the revers of the gold , this is that the government escamote and refuses of opportunity that we achetons also 75 per of our worth of the States - United and that we must pay almost 7.13 $ Canadian for each dollar American . 
these small cycle of the dollar engloutissent of the amounts extremely important of our have . 
of the States - United , to the over of the six first months of 99 , we we whether for 25,8 billion of $ in vehicle under , papers of alternative and equipment rolling , and that for close of 22 billion of $ in bouilloires and machinerie dissent for the great industry . 
a other component essential of our worth is the equipment power and the aircraft of registration for which we we versé11,7 billion of $ to the States - United in six months . 
according a other study , the price of the magazines American sold to the Canada has increased of % per to the over of the last year . 
of more , when we vendons to the States - United our Contents first , which our Railway and our aluminium in vrac , we the rachetons very often into in the products its , in versant a double penalty if our dollar is low . 
in our Custody - eat , the price of the fruit and of the légumes , in majority of importation American , has increased of 30 per since 1992 , then that the of the grain has increased of almost 25 per . 
we glorifions our voisinage with the States - United for describe our way of life , similar to the their , and in same time we we serve of the States - United for we identify , réaffirmant to who to the hear our identity own . 
the trade to the detail , the transportation Air , the sports , - we - we enough heard speak of the problems of the hockey majeur auCanada - the research scientific , the Arts , the television , the culture and the edition we shows that we résistons difficulty to the attrait American . 
the government has said , until here , that the rate of change low of the dollar Canadian favorisait the exports . 
this scenario of the dollar created a part of the more Mortgage of instability . 
he me seems important of out under a other contempt that the Americans not only people our country , but that they are also in are of the buy cash , to the room and in bloc , well that he not be not to sell . 
they are with Lower on our businesses because that their price is up there in reason of the peerage health of our dollar , pardon - me , more low same that " the piastre to Caouette " . 
in a clause of - Presse of the 16 October last , . fact say Mr. Mundell that the loss of the third of the value of the dollar Canadian since 25 years equivalent to a reduction national of salary . 
the being deterrent what a such dévaluation of cake . 
he move , in addition , to the Canada of abandon his policy of fluctuation Monetary and of adopt a rate of change fixed with the dollar American . 
Richard Harris , professor of economy to the University Simon Fraser of the British - British , support this pose and the recorded in the net minority who not there see that of the benefits . 
a such blocage not created not the unanimously . 
not the not deterrent , I not want nothing recommend . 
however , I know that the increases and the small of the dollar provoquent of the enrichissements instantanés . 
how of our citizens , who have least of flair for blood the humeurs of the météo economic , the getting also ! 
I not can not think to the first without internalize of the sadness for the seconds . 
these variations subites and prononcées of the huard have a bad effect psychological . 
in effect , must - I remind that 85 per of our exports will to the States - United , but that 75 per of our worth in people also ? 
that the . not say not that , portion that the Canada exporting , all will for the better in the better of the mondes . 
I there a other question . 
I think to Imasco who , he there has to only few days , has sold Pharmaprix to the Quebec and Shoppers Drug Mart , to the Canada . 
the 1993 of property Canadian by to view of i . 
I thinkers that this will to the Canada . 
think to the plant of montage of under of GM to Boisbriand , to used under respiration artificielle since 10 years and where the employees speak constantly of their fear of a closure imminente . 
the Canada has of a prosperity uncommon , but he role on the chord raide . 
this is because that our power of Purchase within has decreased since few years that we we lost of the jobs , that our young the concerned of their future and that we lisons of the from of concern in the media that I can from the sonnette of alarm . 
a not of temerity more far , I know that some than to the Canada of follow the example of the Union European and of adopt a " common who would the dollar American . 
one , we not in are not that . 
I believe that a great majority of between we , Canadians of the a or of the other language , we too invested in our have national for renier our identity . 
this is for this reason that we whether of we result , without distinction , under the flag American . 
these measures only will to the Canada of maintain his reputation . 
honourable senators , I am course that this is the wish of all the members of this House . 
all , we want article to our children a country in full prosperity . 
this will only a action of peppered and of vigour who foster the performance of our economy . 
now that the government seems have dominé the inflation and have the end since two years to the policy of the Budgets déficitaires , indiscriminate a dollar Canadian to the niveaude 66 cents American is for . 
Authorized to the committee of use the documents and evidence collected during of the review of the bill of bill precedent for the study of the bill of bill present 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Oliver , seconded by the hon. senator Nino Nino : 
that the documents received and the evidence heard by the Committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional to the over of the study of the Bill bill S - 17 , Act amend the Code criminal relatively to the harassment criminal and to of other issues related , during of the first session of the 30 - sixth Parliament , be claimants to the Committee , when he will been set , for the , study of the bill of bill S - 6 . - ( 
the hon. senator Cools ) . 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , the senator Cools has yielding his place and I wish take the speak . 
for conclude the debate on this motion , I like you refer to the ... 
the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I am to interrupt the senator Oliver , but the debate must be adjourned to the behalf of the senator Cools . 
if the senator Oliver wants of the closing , the hon. senator not will not the possible of the express . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
the senator Oliver : 
the senator Carstairs : 
this is very well , honourable senators , to condition that the senator Cools not whatever not take the speak . 
I not wish not to speak now and I am fully interested to listen the senator Oliver . 
the senator Hays : 
since the senator Cools has given the agreed , the senator Oliver can there go of the speech . 
the senator Oliver : 
honourable senators , for closing the debate to on this motion , I like draw your attention on the paragraphs 874 and 875 of the sixth edition of Beauchesne , page 250 . 
they say this who following : 
the committee who not has not debated the inquiry to the end of a session can do report to the House of this fact , and that of the evidence that he has heard . 
he can in addition recommend that to the session next the House him policies the same matter and that he can the serve of the evidence recueillie until - that . 
, least that the House not the allows to in to the , a committee not can do report of the evidence people before a committee similar during of a session order , except under form of appendice . 
he is clear that the evidence received by a committee to the over of a session before can be claimants to a committee to the over of a new session with the leave of the Senate . 
the comment 875 specific that this is all to fact acceptable . 
he for that in the absence of the approval of the Senate , the committee not can do report of the evidence if this not is under form of appendice . 
if . were the Authorized of the Senate for that the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional can examine the evidence received relatively to the bill of bill S - 17 to the over of the last session in the framework of the study of the bill of bill S - 6 during the session current , the committee could then use fully the evidence already collected . 
the practice British support also the acceptability of my motion . 
the nd edition of Erskine Erskine , to the pages 635 and 669 , for that the reports or the trial - Proceedings of evidence of committees precedents who are périmés are frequently claimants to of the committees ultérieurs and that . on and the study of interpellations who not had not been completed to because of the prorogation of the Houses . 
in addition , more of ten precedents have been through for this practice to the over of the ten last years and I I attention the attention of the honourable senators on the a of these précédentsle 3 November last . 
the reason for which this practice is acceptable is all to fact obvious . 
as I the I mentioned the last time that I I raised the question to the Senate , the fact of allow to of the reports and evidence already received by a committee to the over of a session before of be claimants to a committee student the same question to the court of a new session savings of the time and of the money , and this is therefore a practice will . 
why from that a committee call to new of the witnesses who have already appeared to this about ? 
we gaspillons their time and the money of the taxpayer . 
some of these witnesses have appeared to the costs of the Senate and we should their ask of appear to new , still that to the costs of the Senate . 
of more , the honourable members of the committee have already spent many of their time asset to the audition of these witnesses and to the study of the questions . 
why should - we their ask of take still more of their time for hear the same evidence ? 
he not there has no reason for justify that the given that of the precedents have already been through for allow the type of motion that I I proposed relatively to the bill of bill S - 6 . 
I I also consulted Beauchesne to of know this that he said of the instructions to the committee in view of seek to understand the concern raised to this regard by the senator Cools . 
the mentions appropriate listed to the paragraphs 681 to 685 of the pages 210,000 and 211 . 
in the nd edition of Erskine Erskine , he is question of the instructions to the pages 515 to 519 . 
honourable senators , the motion that I , not is not of the nature of a education such that the while Beauchesne and Erskine Erskine . 
a education is a motion Motion a committee to accomplish someone something who him would other , or him enjoignant of accomplish someone something which he could other the alone . 
the authorities discussing also of the types of instructions await . 
the ) echoing to the page grew of Beauchesne for : 
is suggested any education who not the quoted not to the content of the bill of bill or who will to the any of the subject . 
the motion that I , not allows not the committee to accomplish someone something who him would other , . 
all the committees are given to may of the witnesses and to to of the evidence . 
the only something that the Senate allows the committee to accomplish , this is of use the evidence already recueillie by a committee to the opportunity of a sitting before in the framework of the study of a bill of bill . 
the authorities in the of procedure and the practice of the Senate indicate clear that my motion is valid . 
the logical and the efficiency justifying that the . continues of there approach . 
the the the Speaker Acting : 
you pleasure - he , honourable senators , of adopt the motion ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
( the motion is agreed . ) 
Affairs Social , Science and Technology

he is became the about of a sure number of over of schools of medicine and fact now part of their documents of reference for the questions of euthanasia and of assistance to the suicide . 
however , I not I not the intention of review the decisions major of this study related to the euthanasia and to the assistance to the suicide . 
I hope that this study chair only the decisions taken of way unanimous .

I there that all the senators have received this notice . 
the question of privilege respect the identifies in some media , which - Soleil of Quebec and the Toronto Star of today today , of the second array of the report of the committee Standing of the transport and of the Communications on the Divestiture of the industry air to the Canada . 
today today , I I the intention of to this question to the time timely and of propose that the case be référée to the committee Standing of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure . 
the Late of Jeannine Séguin - Late of Omer Deslauriers 
tributes 
the hon. Jean - Robert Gauthier : 
honourable senators , this is with sadness that I I learned the Late deMme Jeannine Séguin , teacher of training . 
Ms Séguin was considered as the a of the more solid pillars of the community local , national and international . 
the Ontario French , all particularly , loses a Leader of leadership and the Canada is in deuil of a woman strong who has affected the education in language French , of the Maritimes to the " of the Western . 
I I known personally Jeannine Séguin and I him so today today tribute for the dedication to the because French . 
Ms Séguin has chaired the Association of the teachers franco - beneficial , the Association Canadian - French of the Ontario and the Federation of the communities francophones and acadiennes of the Canada . 
she the out by his great determination , the entêtement and a sense of the operating policy outside hand . 
she had spent his life to the education , to the promotion of the unity Canadian and to the development of the institutions éducatives in language French . 
the year 99 has dismantling the departure of two great advocates of the community Ontario . 
, the spring , Omer Deslauriers we quittait . 
this man , to the like of Ms Séguin , the was distinguished by the support to the because of the accessibility of the francophones beneficial to the services of education and of health . 
we are today today in deuil of two people who have dismantling our community . 
the tenth anniversary of the commitment of eliminate the poverty 
the hon. Erminie J . Cohen : 
however , to the place of be been , the poverty home the children the is increased of 60 per to the over of the last decade . 
and , 460 $ children about are in a situation by . 
our efforts for do people the poverty home the children have been déplorables . 
yesterday last , I I participated to a vigile in silence before the Flamme Girl for pleurer the inability of the Parliament of the Canada of respect the commitment to the regard of the children poor . 
I about today today , honourable senators , to the behalf of the hundreds of thousands of children of our country rich who continue of live in the poverty , to go to the school the much vacuum and to live in of the housing délabrés . 
they forsaken on the government for respect the speak of the Parliament and to his promises , but this promise has been abusing . 
, the over of the last decade , the rate of unemployment high has been pointé of the doigt as the a of the major causes of the number growing of children living in the poverty . 
yet , then that the rate of unemployment have began to cut , the poverty home the children has continued of increase . 
why ? 
with this minuscule amount , she must the urban , the esteem and the vêtir and that the child . 
the children poor are opposite all the legalities to the same sad reality . 
how can - they centrer their attention on the learning when they live in of the conditions also déplorables ? 
they not can not be on a boyhood without included . 
. note of the warning of the , of bad health , of behaviour antisocial and of the delay in the learning of the vocabulary . 
this is unacceptable in a country who the vaunts of have a level of life higher . 
the rate of poverty to the Canada is almost bashful . 
, the over of the last decade , honourable senators , the government has reduced of way would the funds paid to the provinces for of the needs basic - for the services social , for of the housing done , for of the care of health and for the education . 
the reform of the insurance - unemployment one particularly the women which the Eligibility to the benefits has reached the more senior level in the history the year last . 
. has eliminated the deficit to the backs of the programs social . 
in fact , our political national have virtually forsaken the children to their fate to the over of the last years . 
, the enter of a new millennium , I implore the government of to the promise made to our children , promise who not would never should stay letter morte . 
he there has a ray of hope : the recent announcement of a you of six million of $ in the housing social . 
add - there of other are and affectons - the to the investment to long term , to the support of the income and to the services for to the children to of improve the condition of the without - homeless , of remanier the insurance - employment in in atténuant the requirements and in rolls the number of the people eligible . 
let seriously the role drives of the government federal with of the provinces in the of Benefit of the programs social . 
the discussions should to not not on the sharing of the powers between the government federal and the provinces , but rather on this that the governments can do , together , for help the people in the need , because he must the remind that the children of today today are the leaders and the taxpayers of tomorrow . 
they deserve many better . 
we we a obligation to them and to the Canada .

however , he rest always a trou of 60 million of $ , in this sense that we know the reason of these million . 
we we asked of the explanation to the representatives of the board . 
he would can - be better that the hon. Leader will these information of the Council of the Board and that he the tabled to the Senate , because I am puzzling of know to what are RCMP these 60 million of $ . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
that fact a very nice residence . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I will ask these information to the behalf of the hon. senator and I rapporterai to the Senate any information that I be in legislation of obtain . 
the justice 
the cost of the program of registration of the weapons to fire - - responsibility of the Minister 
the hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , during of the same meeting , yesterday morning , Mr. Mr. , of the Council of the Board , has appeared before the committee for speak of the Estimates Supplementary of the Estimates , in particular of the program of registration of the weapons to fire . 
I him I asked a sure number of questions on the reason for which 35 million of $ additional were necessary then that of the appropriation of 40 million of $ had already been some in the budget initial . 
Mr. . Mr. has then seemed the cost of the program of registration of the weapons to fire since 1995 . 
I I me - same been am in something the figure of 309 million of $ . 
the government should know that this amount bashful , this is this that number of parliamentarians and of opposed to the program of registration of the weapons to fire him had predicting in 1994 and 1995 , to know that his estimates were very in minimum of the reality and that the program cost of the hundreds of million of $ . 
the government has rejected all our protests in saying that we not know not of what we pasts . 
the Minister , Mr. Rock , had said that the cost would of only 85 million of $ and this , for any the term of the program of registration , be of 1995 to 2001 . 
we in are now to 309 million of $ and this not is not last . 
the Leader of the government is - he also of notice that the Minister Rock is responsible of this enormous mistake of calculating who costs of the hundreds of million of $ to the taxpayers Canadian ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I I a interpretation little different of the response provided by the senior official . 
the senator Forrestall : 
why not accept he not this responsibility , in this case ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
I know that the process of registration knows of the difficulties . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
. the has well indicated he there has three years . 
the senator Boudreau : 
in reality , a review has been made in May last and of the recommendations have been made for improve the process . 
the three quarters of these recommendations have been colleague . 
the treatment of the requests of registration is now more effective . 
according the information which I has , 8 500 for are délivrés and 35 $ weapons to fire are parcels each months . 
that not does not all to fact to the question that the hon. senator has raised , but that the really that the process has been examined , that of the improvements have been made and that the system seems operate . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , this is always the same history . 
they have said that this was the Minister . 
I ask now to the Leader of the government to the Senate who is responsible and he does that , well course , the Minister is always responsible , but that he there has had all these problems . 
he not there has never of responsible , because that the he there in had a , he bet . 
the senator Forrestall : 
hear ! 
the senator Tkachuk : 
the he not served not his Resignation , this is that he consider that he not is not responsible . 
who therefore is responsible to the within of the bureaucracy ? 
this is possible also . 
the Minister could can - be we say , the he is responsible as he the states , what price he must pay for a if serious mistake ? 
why not has he not resigned ? 
the he not is not responsible , who therefore is responsible to the within of the democracy ? 
can - be the Minister should - he ask the held of a inquiry official for in inform the parliamentarians . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I understand the concerns of the senator as to the Estimates exceed Conducted in the framework of this program . 
the hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , I I a question Supplementary to question . 
the government must surely have now a idea of this that will the costs Overall . 
will . spending higher million , 800 million or a billion of $ ? 
not pays - you not we give a idea of the costs financial some ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I debate certainly of the question with the Minister responsible and will share to the House of all the information that I receive . 
the Affairs Intergovernmental 
the conditions of a next referendum Quebec - - impact of the initiative of the government 
the hon. Jean - Claude Rivest : 
honourable senators , then that the Canadians the concern of the questions economic and Social , the government of the Canada has chosen artificiellement , in a of his talk improvisations , of bring to the Prime plan the question referendum . 
why the government of the Canada has he decided to this time - this of bring this question to the before - scene of the appropriate policy to the Canada ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , if the government Canadian Justice appropriate of express the notice on a question also fundamental that the which we about , the or is absolutely necessary . 
the or is required as to comments of the nature of the question that to comments of the result required for that the process démarre . 
as to know what is the better time for raise this question and the to publicly for actually clear the notice of the government , I i that no time not is better that a other , since this not is not for all of the . 
the government and the Prime Minister feel can - be that he is timely of airing clear as now the point of view of the government of the Canada on these questions very important to the place of expect of be in the fire of the campaign . 
the senator Rivest : 
honourable senators , to short term , I not know not if the Minister in is aware , but the initiative of the Prime Minister of the Canada of raise this question àce time - this seems unfortunately to to the advantage of the option sovereigntist to the Quebec . 
I not know not what lecturele government Canadian retient of the initiative . 
Onparle many of the or of this question . 
the Minister etle government of the Canada are - they aware that leurinitiative - taken seems he unilaterally - , far of cimenter the cohesion of the forces federalists to the Quebec , creates unfortunately of the confusion home those who must defend the option Canadian to the Quebec ? 
the Leader of the Party Liberal of the Quebec , Mr. Jean Charest , the is dissocié publicly , this after - afternoon , to the Assembly national , of the initiative taken by the Prime Minister of the Canada . 
is - this that the government think that this manner unilaterally of proceed in the debate referendum well the because of the unity Canadian ? 
not would - he not better that the government of the Canada , the government of the Quebec and those of the other provinces showing a attitude of opening and of understanding for convince the Quebecers of choose the seaway of the option Canadian ? 
some Quebecers who were without too of conviction for the sovereignty us without doubt the option Canadian . 
he not must not give of arguments to these people . 
the he there had a referendum to the Quebec in this time , this initiative placerait the Party Quebec of a side , Jean tien of the other . 
jean Charest and the Party Liberal of the Quebec not do too of what side look ! 
in soulevant formally the question of the referendum without consult the Main the - speak of the forces federalists to the Quebec , the Party Liberal of the Quebec , well - . the because of the unity Canadian ? 
in subject unilaterally , . déstabilise the Party Liberal of the Quebec and the forces federalists calling . 
in January or February 2000 , I hope that this unfortunate incident will forgotten . 
the Minister could - he convince his colleagues of the cabinet , in particular the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Affairs Intergovernmental , of avoid of lead of the actions who used the because of the separatists benefiting the sovereignty to the Quebec ? 
not could - he not attempt of people his colleagues to work of way positive and normal with the together of the federalists Quebec for strengthen the option federalist to the Quebec to the place of the unnoticed , as . has unfortunately could the see this week ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , he is clear that the Prime Minister consider the question important and fundamental for the future of the country . 
the notice regarding the had and the separation is humoured . 
on this point basic , he not there has not of disagreement . 
by respect for the Quebecers who voteraient to a requires referendum , if the Canada and the Quebec have the misfortune of in have a other , we have a role to play and a opinion to express for do in so that the question be clear . 
he any of express this opinion , and I believe that the Prime Minister think also that he must the do know . 
some say that the government of the Canada must be a simple observer , a " voyeur " , in all referendum who the déroulerait to the Quebec , same if the question prepared greatly to confusion and if the results are steely . 
the senator Rivest : 
is - this that the Leader of the government to the Senate it hear by his response that the very hon. Prime Minister of the Canada , Mr. Pierre Elliott Trudeau , during of the referendum of 1980 , not was that a voyeur ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , we we of determine in what legislation the government of the Canada the play a role in the process referendum to the Quebec . 
we we received of the give conflicting . 
if the government not is not satisfy of the question prepared and unequivocally by the Assembly national , will he there superposer his own question ? 
. does often the word " or " . 
in last analysis , who determine if the question is enough clear ? 
will - this the government of the Canada or the Assembly national of the Quebec ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , in the preview decision that she has made , the Court Supreme has indicated that the government of the Canada has indeed a role to play in the process . 
I I heard , yesterday last , this that the Prime Minister had said to the period of the questions to the other place . 
the elements of the matter are still to the study , as the Prime Minister the has indicated , but I am sure that he will know in detail the Position of the government as that he will prepared to the do . 
, this time - that , I be very happy of you give more of details that I not can the do today today . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
honourable senators , I remind to the Minister that the Court Supreme not has the or judgment or decision , that this was a simple opinion , and that she not has given of guidelines to no government . 
the Court Supreme has been called to the deal on three questions domain in a referred of the government of the Canada . 
I remind also to the Minister that the province of Quebec has refused of the present before the Court Supreme and that this last has should load a lawyer of represent the province . 
, the three questions , the court has answered " not " . 
unfortunately , to my notice , the Court Supreme has far outrepassé the mandate in décidant of establish some lines guidelines regarding the question and the result , what that they be . 
, my notice , that has matching for effect of légitimer the separation . 
, because of the Court Supreme , because that she has established of the lines guidelines and of the rules on the way which the approach referendum should the dérouler and on this who should happen if the result not was not favourable to the Canada , he is became for the first time legitimate of speak of the possible of a separation . 
I believe that the Court Supreme has outrepassé that the mandate . 
of any manner , why the government federal not we said - he not what question him expression acceptable , not said - he not to the government Quebec that he not treated of the credibility that to the response to this question and not it he not the Quebecers decide ? 
what question should - . question to the Quebecers , according the government federal ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , if the . in just never to that , I there that the question will worded by the Assembly national of the Quebec . 
I not believe not that the government federal want put to the people Quebec a question to on the separation . 
in this who respect the decision of the Court Supreme , this is a question of opinion . 
the hon. senator Lynch - Lynch has given the opinion on the comments made by the Court Supreme . 
I think that good number consider that these comments have been very useful and that they have given a indication of the way which the Canadians wish that their government at to a requires process . 
he is to hope that this constituted not the inquire never . 
in the interest of the Quebecers and of the Canadians , can he not never there have of other question referendum .

the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I rise to the about of the bill of bill C - 6 . 
as you be the see , honourable senators , he not the is not of a Presented in good and properly form to this about . 
this is a bill of bill who found since a sure time to the Paper and who has fact the subject of very good discussions . 
I commend the sponsor of the bill of bill , the senator Kirby , and that the senators Murray , Finestone , Oliver and Keon , which the interventions we have many drafting to understand the bill of bill . 
, the listen , I I have that they appuyaient in the together the bill of bill , but that they entretenaient however some concerns soulignées in particular by the notice of motion presented more earlier today today by the senator Murray . 
I speak particularly of the process surrounding the study of the bill of bill C - 6 . 
in quality of Leader Deputy of the government to the Senate , I must recognize that I I very forward that he be sent to the committee . 
of the comments me have been made - and I am am that this was the case for all the honourable senators - by of the witnesses potential who wish appear before the committee , which some the concerned of the wording present of the bill of bill and would have the opportunity of indication the improvements that they sharpest see . 
as I the I mentioned before , some of the honourable senators who are define in the debate on the bill of bill have expressed of the reserves similar . 
the objective that I is in my quality of Leader Deputy is of ensure to this that the bill of bill be sent to the committee to that these witnesses so be heard and that we can to to the step next of the process legislative . 
however , I acknowledge the need of do place to a debate on the legislation legislative and a notice of motion has been presented in view of scinder the bill of bill . 
he there has same had of the comments of the senator Finestone of our side of the House to the about of the study of a amendment to the bill of bill . 
I I discussed with my counterpart , the senator Kinsella , Leader Deputy of the Opposition , as the for the clause 38 of the Rules , to of attempt of find a ground of agreement on the way which . should deal this bill of bill , the the of the concerns expressed by the senators . 
this last has underlined that the better way of attempt of conclude a agreement on the way of deal this bill of bill would that I raises of first the question to the Senate today today for that the senators be well to the fact of my proposal . 
if of other senators want do of the comments on my proposal , this is perfect . 
then , I inviterai the senator Kinsella to we do share of his own comments on the proposal - during the period Senators to the questions and comments - of way to this that the senators be well to the aware of this who the what and why . 
the bill of bill C - 6 in is the step of the second Reading and he seems that he be important for the Opposition that he in rest that until to this that we we had the time of we look on some proposals of amendments . 
, my notice , he would benefit for this do of power be on the deliberations of the committees relatively to this bill of bill . 
this that I me without to technique , this not is not a motion , but rather a idea for a motion possible . 
if the honourable unhappy the idea , I speak their ask the leave required . 
this is and that I suggestion of deal this bill of bill . 
however , before that I the my suggestion , I like say that the author of the motion and the Main another for the Opposition should obtain the leave of take the speak . 
, as of Leader Deputy of the government , I am prepared to give this leave for facilitate the things and find a ground of agreement to the Senate . 
I should also out that this not is not the first time that a proposal of this kind is tabled since that I ' this position . 
I know that the senator Frith and the senator Doody , when they were all the two leaders assistants of their party respectif , had sometimes acted and . 
this not is not a situation who should to my notice the represent often . 
he the is therefore of a attempt of do current the bill of bill to the Senate all in appearing the flexibility necessary for hear the reserves expressed to the about . 
honourable senators , I move , to the outcome of our discussion , that the bill of bill C - 6 be referred to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology , with education that he in be fact rapportle 2 December 99 in two consistently : the Prime on the part 1 and the second on the parties 2 to 5 of the bill of bill ; that the debate on the second Reading that place by the the and led to term ; and that all review supplementary of the bill of bill be made in committee Whole . 
I not want not propose the motion all of the . 
we not things generally not of the so to the Senate , but that sounds enough to our way of do for that human not that place of the in concern . 
however , I ask to the senator Kinsella of we give the notice , to the way of a question or of a observation , and I lead then of the opportunity for the question to my turn . 
of other senators want can - be the express to this about , including the senator Kirby and the senator Murray . 
, the conclusion of this discussion or of this debate , I ask then the leave of present the motion which I you I already given the major lines . 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , as just of the do having the senator Hays , me the already expressed on this bill of bill , I ask the leave of answer now to this proposal . 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
the leave is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Murray : 
honourable senators , I thank the Leader Deputy of the government of his comments and of his proposal . 
as he the has very s said , he there has to the Senate a support General for the principle and the objective of this bill of bill . 
however , he there has of the problems are have fact referring some of between we in their speech during of the second Reading . 
I can say very briefly this that I I to say and I the say under any contingency of the notice of motion that I I put before you today today . 
he me is perfectly indifférent that we renvoyions the bill of bill or , as the has proposed the senator , the subject of the bill of bill to the committee this week . 
if the senator Hays think that proceed of the so will for effect of speed the review of the bill of bill and , in particular , the study of some problems who have been raised , I him made my support total . 
: said , he there has a point that I not I not very well including . 
the Leader Deputy has he proposed a date for the report of the committee ? 
the senator Hays : 
the senator Murray : 
this is this that I would have heard . 
I me ask . 
the senator Kirby , the chairman of the committee , me has guest yesterday to attend to a meeting of the committee of direction with him and the senators Carstairs and LeBreton . 
, this meeting , we we past in magazine the list of the witnesses potential , this is - to - say the people who have expressed the desire of the present before the committee for express their points of view on the bill of bill . 
as the chairman of the committee could the confirm , the list is long . 
I I said to this meeting that I me intéressais more - if I then me express and - to the quality that to the amount . 
I want ensure to this that the major points of view be views and internally in full . 
I I found that he not is can - be not necessary of hear all those who had expressed the desire of the present before we . 
this is however to the senator Kirby that government the task untimely of try of in persuade some that they not have not need of be heard . 
this is always difficult . 
I want do understand that this would a travestissement of our duty that of try of do complements the study of the subject of the bill of bill by the committee before the 2 December and that that exposerait with reason the Senate and the committee to of get criticism . 
honourable senators , of other wish can - be speak to this about . 
I not I absolutely no objection , in principle , to before now the committee of the subject of the bill of bill and to do examine the bill of bill in committee Whole a time that the committee will fact report to the Senate . 
the government to that the things argue . 
however , the he can be sure of accept a amendment who résoudrait the problems who have been raised here , particularly in the sector of the care of health , I would prepared to this that we the considering and to this that we the renvoyions to the House of the Commons to time for that she can the study before the ajournementdu 17 December . 
honourable senators , such are the benchmarks of the situation such that I the see . 
the chairman or the other members of the committee have the speak . 
the hon. Michael Kirby : 
honourable senators , I I me also need of the leave of the Senate for take the speak , fault of what my intervention will normally end to the debate to the step of the second Reading , this that I not I not the intention of do . 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
the leave is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Kirby : 
honourable senators , as of usual , without doubt because that the senator Murray and me - same we all two been Leader of s of a Prime Minister of the Maritimes , I am in full agreed with him on all this that he has said . 
in some case , the affinités regional are many more strong that the affinités political . 
the fact is that of many witnesses have asked to appear before the committee . 
that the . veterinary the subject of the bill of bill to a committee Whole or to the committee of the Affairs Social , the heard that my committee would two reports , me any little . 
the two options we suitable . 
when the senator Murray said that he to alters the question , I believe that he timely the sentiment that we must we ensure that we understand exactly of what he not in this who respect the care of health , and I am of agreed with him . 
in the motion that has introduced the senator Hays , he is obvious that , little any if a date clear is arrêtée , the essential is that we entamions our business quickly . 
he would that the committee seat to be of afternoon , Monday , until in the evening , and that he in the as Tuesday and Wednesday . 
of where my notice of motion . 
, the like of the senator Murray , I believe that we must begin to examine the question quickly . 
as he the said , if the committee seemed happen to the conclusion that a amendment to the bill of bill was justified , all as him , I believe that he would important that the Senate veterinary the bill of bill to the House of the Commons to time for that she the examine before the making of ë . 
in the together , I am of agreed with the senator Murray . 
I not I nothing to repeat on the substance of the bill of motion of the senator Hays , to condition that we can remove the says of the date and all simply there , by wrote or by a agreement between the senators , that the committee chair this bill of bill quickly and of a manner effective . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
I believe that we we sought and found a model who recueille the consent of the government and of the Opposition to the Senate . 
I believe that we should refer today today the bill of bill to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology . 
. the is heard for that the committee the the work and the the with haste , portion that he that all the opportunities of hear the witnesses that he Justice necessary of may . 
as the question has been raised during the debate , the proposal that that the committee contemplated of present a report in two parties or two reports separate not has not so of importance . 
the committee sonderait the opinion of his members and the decide then . 
we are aware of the will parliamentarians that require the participation of the other place . 
I am in legislation of say that the Opposition not opposera no barrier for do know to the other place that a good report has been prepared and a excellent decision taken by the Senate . 
for this who is of the procedure , seen that I I the speak , I would happy of propose a motion , to least that a other senator not whatever speak on the question . 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , I should can - be indication that the senators of this side - this are prepared to amend the motion , to of remove the says of the date of Presented of the report and , of the same the , remove the referred to the committee Whole . 
to heard the senators Murray and Kinsella , I believe that this not is not necessary for we . 
by therefore , I accept that the motion not contains not of such elements . 
if this is this that the senator Kinsella has in head , I not me there against not , I am of agreed . 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I ask a confusion , because I must by that I not understand not very well this that . we ask . 
how the witnesses , who are impatients of speak of this bill of bill according the senator Kirby , will - they help the committee to study the subject of the bill of bill ? 
I not see not this that all these witnesses , who have of the very to forward to the regard of lapartie 1 or 2 or of a clause whatever , will to if the subject is referred to the committee . 
I not understand not this that we me of do . 
I not want not brouiller the cartes , but he me seems that we should proceed in two steps . 
then , the witnesses the présenteraient before the committee for speak of the bill of bill him - same . 
if we we transformons in committee Whole , the witnesses who have appeared before the committee student the subject of the bill of bill will - they to before the committee Whole for speak of the bill of bill him - same ? 
I like have of the clarification to the about of the process and of the procedure that . we ask of follow . 
is - this this that the government wish ? 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , I could can - be answer . 
all that is enough new for me , but I had the same concerns that the senator . 
he the is here of a question of procedure . 
if the bill of bill must stay to the step of the second Reading , then his second Reading must stay on to the Paper . 
for that the bill of bill rest recorded in second Reading to the Paper , he must stay before the Senate . 
the motion is introduced as she the is for that the committee can study all the aspects of the bill of bill , including the subject , this is - to - say the further of the bill of bill , and for that the bill of bill rest to the step of the second Reading , this who does to the concerns expressed by our opposite - to - opposite to the about of the Division of the bill of bill , this question not to not still been resolved . 
the motion allows of proceed to the review of the bill of bill without do of entorse to the procedure . 
we we the majority of this side - this , but you you the tools of the yours . 
the purpose of all that , this is of try of have a solution in under of the clause 38 rather that of the clause 39 . 
he seems that all will very well . 
I hope well that a motion will introduced . 
for the reasons that I I mentioned , I not think not that the bill of bill or the study not will compromise of the fact that the committee will before of the subject of the bill of bill rather that of this last in as that such . 
the senator Murray : 
honourable senators , if you the let , I say that the referred of the subject of a bill of bill to a committee is exactly the same something that this that we had used of do when the study pre was Cabinet to the Senate . 
course , we not could , on the plan of the procedure , refer a bill of bill to a committee before of the have received of the House of the Commons . 
however , a time that the bill of bill was tabled to the House of the Commons , for facilitate the study to the Senate , we communiquions the subject of the bill of bill to the committee sake . 
the - this entendait of the witnesses as the he had been before of the bill of bill . 
he was then report to the Senate . 
we were all to fact free , when we were before of a bill of bill , of refer the - this to a committee and of hear of other witnesses . 
more often that other , before same that the bill of bill we be referred by the House of the Commons , we had already from satisfaction of the share of the government as to the amendments , including . 
the step of the study in committee not was often made that for the form , but the formula that we doubt to the Senate , and who sounds to the study of the subject of the bill of bill that move the senator Hays , has long had over to the Senate . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
honourable senators , I not I never heard speak of a situation where the Senate has fact the study pre of a bill of bill who had already been adopted to the House of the Commons . 
the senator Murray : 
not , but he there has a sure number of precedents by report to this that the senator Hays move . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
the senator Hays has proposed that the committee the before on the question , but that the bill of bill rest here . 
the senator Murray : 
this is exactly , and he there a precedent to this regard . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
is - this to say that the witnesses who appear before the committee must the settle of speak of the about , or will - they , of any way , to in Freshwater a copy of the bill of bill ? 
the senator Murray : 
not , they not will not of constraint to this regard . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
it - you in are of say that all that not is that a façade ? 
the senator Murray : 
he the is of a mechanism of procedure . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
I not see not who fate it of that . 
why déploierions - we of the efforts in two steps , then that , in reality , he not the Glenney that of a only and same effort ? 
if I am the only to not not understand , I want well me nothing immediately . 
I not understand not why the about of a bill of bill which the Senate is before is referred to a committee who further of the witnesses speak of the about , then that , in reality , this is of the bill of bill which they want speak . 
can - they speak of the bill of bill same if the - this not has not been referred to the committee ? 
I not understand not this part of the procedure . 
the senator Forrestall : 
he the is of the same bill of bill . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
why then not not refer the bill of bill and in conclusion a time for all ? 
I not trying not of help the government . 
I want simply understand the procedure and facilitate the things . 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , . has point to this mechanism of procedure for to the of the reserves of the senator Murray . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
that me satisfy , then . 
the senator Hays : 
we could refer the substance of the bill of bill , but he at better the read for the second time and the refer as we the do of usual . 
we we been in communication with the author of the bill of bill and Main another , to know the senator Murray , in opposite . 
we in are upon to the proposal , who is essentially a agreement reached of way transparent on the photographs of the Senate , to the place of to the senators before a fact work , this who would without doubt raised many of other questions to share of the of the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
the senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , a brin of creativity is always the by . 
the senator Hays has tried of be losing . 
however , we we thought course of to our discussion to the Senate for that all the world understands exactly this that we were . 
a great advantage of this way of do , this is well course that , if the two sides of the Senate have a opinion serious and free on the question of know if this bill of bill contains more of a principle , . can happen to the essential through to this that say the witnesses . 
we able and be owe by the committee before of we deal on the principle of the bill of bill . 
according a proposition , in fact , that would to solve the problem if the committee recommended of scinder the bill of bill . 
if the bill of bill it with of the proposals of amendment , that solve can - be the problem . 
of many opportunities the may to the committee . 
this is a way has of deal the question . 
the senator Hays want can - be present now his motion .

bill of bill of 99 on the implementation in implement of conventions tax 
second Reading 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Hervieux - Hervieux , P , seconded by the hon. senator Robichaud , P ( - Acadie - Acadia ) , that the bill Bill S - 3 , Act an in implement a agreed , of the conventions and of the protocoles concluded between the Canada and the Kirghizistan , the Lebanon , the Algeria , the Bulgaria , the Portugal , the Ouzbékistan , the Jordan , the Japan and the Luxembourg , in view of avoid the duplicates Socialist and of prevent the evasion tax in the of taxes on the income , be read a second time . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I am very Whip that the auteure of the bill of bill be still am today today and not can not speak of this bill of bill . 
yesterday , I I listened the comments of the senator Lynch - Lynch regarding the bill of bill S - 3 . 
he has open the speech by a note very important . 
that one the record in the of respect of the rights of the human of a of the country countries of this treaty , to know the Ouzbékistan . 
he me seems , honourable senators , that the question serious who should be to the spirit of all the honourable senators is of know if , in as that country , we want send a signal and draw the attention of the authorities of the Ouzbékistan on their record in the of respect of the rights of the human . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch has quoted two reports of Zinn Zinn AsiaWatch who parlaient of abuses documentées of the rights of the human and signalaient also that our own Department of the Affairs foreign had in his possession a sure number of documents debates to the record unacceptable of this country in the of respect of the rights of the human . 
honourable senators , notwithstanding our policy foreign of commitment moreover which we we the opportunity of speak of time to other in this chamber , he is question in this case - this of a relationship bilateral . 
he me seems that if the commitment moreover must mean what that this be , he would many if we could say to a country that we are saddened , but that we not are not loans to sign a treaty with him to because of the record within in the of respect of the rights of the human . 
this is exactly the reason for which we who this country of the application of the bill of bill S - 3 . 
honourable senators , the question of abuses concealment and order of the rights of the human not is not a something that we should take to the lightly in as that society free and democratic . 
as the honourable senators the know , the resolution 1503 of the Nations Nations about directly of the abuses concealment and order of the rights of the human and of the obligation of all the members of the community international of take of the measures positive and of to their support direct for eliminate this type of abuses of the rights of the human . 
honourable senators , this is a opportunity in however for the Canada of start a message very clear and hon. . 
we can say that we not retardons not the implementation in implement of treated to the regard of several country Treaty by this bill of bill , but only in this who respect this country in particular , to because of his abuses yearly , concealment and order of the rights of the human . 
that we will of say that we not wish not conclude a treaty with this country . 
honourable senators , that we were the focus on the conventions of Vienne to on the implementation in implement of the treated international or on some of the treated international with the rights of the man , as the Covenant international relatifaux rights civilians and political or the Covenant international relatif to the rights economic , social and Cultural , this are all of the treated that the Canada , to the like of many of other country of the world , has conclude , adopted and the in implement and we should to attention to the rights of the human some in these treated . 
honourable senators , I thank the senator Lynch - Lynch of have attention our attention on the fact that the government of the Canada move that we concluions a treaty with this country particular in under of the same right nerve who has chaired to the conclusion of other treated that we we conclude in the of rights of the human . 
I think therefore , honourable senators , that he is angry important that this House the clear know his Position . 
we can decide or well of propose a amendment to the step of the second Reading , before of refer the bill of bill to a committee , or well , this who would better advised , now that we we raised formally this question , of refer the bill of bill to a committee of way to this that the senators members of the committee the emparent of the question that has raised our colleague , the senator Lynch - Lynch , and the make that of the representatives of the Affairs foreign and of other witnesses craft before the committee . 
the honourable Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , I like question a question to the hon. senator . 
I not I or heard or read the speech of the senator Lynch - Lynch , but the principle that he millions is very interesting . 
he we is came of have of the trade to this about , not only here , but in of other representations . 
he the focuses on a country particular . 
the hon. senator to - he say that , before of adopt a legislation bilateral in the of tax , we should , as the are of time in time the States - United , examine the performance of each country part to this agreed in this who respect the rights of the human ? 
the senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , I thank the senator Grafstein of his question . 
I contend in a Prime time that I not see not of generates to this model of monitoring of the rights of the man . 
the experience seeing in of many country , including to the States - United , who the have essayée under the regime Carter , the is disinfection probante , as . the would know . 
I accept to reluctantly the principle of the commitment moreover . 
I am for the good reason that I not know not who the his behind this Administration public . 
in the protocoles who gouvernent the conduct of our members of trade or of our members to the abroad , I not see nothing who the makes to indication by wrote , in their reports apartment or annual , the number of time where they will raised the question of the rights of the man , for that we can exercise a followed administrative work and whether the effectiveness real of this commitment moreover . 
well that the principle me paraisse acceptable in theory , I not believe not that he be of application Universal . 
in the case who we ' , he the is of a convention tax specific . 
he the is of a agreed bilateral . 
the bill of bill so many of country to the number which the in find unfortunately a who we makes to examine the question . 
in second place , I wish that we we of a Previous surgical in this who has relates to these agreements bilateral . 
I examinerais for my share the background of each country in the of rights of the man and I déciderais in service of this that I would observers if I wish or not to give the to the agreed the regarding , or still if I not like not use this instrument of our policy foreign for draw their attention on the problem . 
the senator Grafstein : 
as must the know the senator , the States - United have adopted a system , that we not we not still fact ours - well that he seems that such be the intention of the new Minister of the Affairs foreign in his new policy on the security human - in under which a assessment Annual is done by country , sometimes by region , of the abuses choquantes of the rights and freedoms of the individuals . 
the 251 of state the attention regularly and they are the subject of debates in the two Houses of the Congress American . 
we we favourite not not follow this model . 
we we decided deliberately of not not do of links . 
I not know not what side of the gold I finirais not adopt to the light of the new policy of security of the people who has been worded by the Minister responsible of the Affairs External and who has been réitérée by the Prime Minister . 
however , if we must we Engage in this seaway , he would generally better of to a debate here to of allow to all the honourable senators of in come to a conclusion as to the seaway to follow , to the place of we in take to a country in particular sake by a bill of bill . 
I discredit for the first time a the of i quick to the bill of bill and I note that he there has a or two or can - be same three other country - and I am well attention to this that I say in the here - to comments which . can probably saying the same something , of after of the sections of newspapers , in issue of a form systematic of abuses concealment of the rights of the human . 
I commend the hon. senator of in opposite of have raised this question . 
before of we to to adopt of the solutions of exception , I rather that he the of the comments for know if we should participate or not to this debate and see if we not should not examine systematically under this contempt the bills of bill of this nature . 
I comforting then more rassurant of operate according a framework préétabli to the place of proceed according the inspiration of the time . 
the senator Kinsella : 
a something who me just to the spirit in response to the question of the hon. senator , this is that he is necessary of respond drew to the abuses of the rights of the human account to the bad will . 
when . the in makes the very clear , he must act for refute these abuses of the rights of the human by bad will . 
in the case of a type systémique , hospitals or historic of discrimination , I am fully of agreed with you . 
he must have a policy more deliberately and more general . 
that respect all the aspects of the policy international , there including the trade international and the dynamic of the interest national . 
however , in all the case of abuses of the rights of the human , he not is not necessary of expect a improvement of the situation of the rights of the human for apply to a situation empoisonnée a kind systémique or hospitals of solution . 
he there has of the case where the . can see clear this kind of violation and the there deal directly . 
I not believe not that this treaty be essential for the interest of the country . 
he could however be interesting because that he is always good of have of the treated with several country . 
however , the Parliament could certainly draw many of attention the he announced that he the exclude a sure country . 
he is sure that of the discussions official have had place before that the bill of bill in so to this step and of the questions have should be raised . 
the officials the Pakistani also on our discussions and our debate of this after - afternoon and they the features the that the Canadians taking the standards provisions to the rights of the human to the seriously . 
the hon. Consiglio Nino Nino : 
honourable senators , I like continue in the same vein that the senator Kinsella . 
I am of agreed with him . 
honourable senators , I believe that we should we look on the question . 
the debate of yesterday 1 well to our discussion of today today because that we about of a relationship bilateral with a sure number of States different . 
we we concluded of the agreements , of the protocoles and of the conventions similar with almost all the country to the world . 
the senator Kinsella has indicated that deal with the state who fact the subject of the debate froisse the sense of the to - comments , because he the is of a state known for have breached the rights of the human . 
however , I believe that the senator Kinsella appropriate that of the tens of country have the same sad record . 
I like also me ensure that we understand that he not the is not simply of sign a agreed . 
he the is of sign a agreed who for the Exchange of information on of the companies and of the individuals and that on the Affairs of the Canadians with some of these country foreign . 
that me concern , because , very frankly , I not am not confidence to some of these States for that these information remain negotiates . 
if I am of the Affairs with a of these States , as this is the case now for the society Talisman to the Libya , I should accept the risk that some information that my country current to the government soudanais to my about and to the about of my company not be not also danger that they the would in under of the bill of other country of the world . 
this is a other aspect that we should examine more carefully . 
I I raised this question yesterday because that , he there has several months , we we had case to a bill of bill similar to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign and we we asked the same questions that today today . 
I not I not the Appendix that we we never from of answers . 
, my notice , the committee qualified to examine this bill of bill is the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
we can repeating the comments that have made the senators Lynch - Lynch , Kinsella and Grafstein and continue of ask to the representatives of the Department of answer to the questions that we we raised the last time that we we examined a bill of bill similar . 
the hon. LoisM. Wilson : 
honourable senators , I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition that raised this question . 
she the recorded in the new debate on the Position of the Canada to the regard of the rights of the human . 
. has mentioned that the Ouzbékistan , of same that the Libya and several other country , Ministry a problem . 
he seems that . examine these case of way thinks . 
I am of notice that . not can apply a policy general who convienne to all the country . 
sometimes , of the sanctions are cut ; sometimes , . resolution a policy of commitment moreover . 
he can ceased different strategies applicable to different country . 
I think that the Senate has need of a gallery for urge these questions . 
the committee who is in this case - this is can - be the committee of the Affairs foreign , and not the committee of the Banking . 
he must examine that , be here , to the over of a debate full , be in committee . 
I hope that the committee which this bill of bill will referred will seriously the question and in will share to the Senate . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I not like not prevent of other senators of to this question , but the senators government like that this bill of bill be referred to a committee . 
as he has been presented here , he must be submitted to the approval of the House of the Commons . 
I there that he would relatively easy of there to a amendment , in this sense that , if we supprimions , by example , the word Ouzbékistan , he not we would not business . 
the Department of the Affairs foreign role a role to the regard of these treated , but he in will of same for the Department of the Finance and for Revenue Canada , since this are of the conventions tax . 
if the comments held to the over of the debate are greatest , and I not I no reason of in douter , we should we ask why we should negotiate a convention tax with a country who has a sad record in the of rights of the human . 
why conclude a treaty with this country ? 
the people the more qualifiées for answer to this question are the officials who have rigorous the treaty , who the have concluded . 
as to the question who concern the senator Nino Nino , to know to what committee this legislation should be referred , I I asked of the information on this who the fact of usual . 
of any obviously , the legislation could be referred to the committee of the Banking or to the of the Affairs foreign . 
he the can that the committee of the Banking , after have examined the bill of bill , the veterinary to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
of any way , of after this that I I heard to the over of the debate , the study of this bill of bill not the will not without that the . there the questions that we we heard here . 
this is to the committee that these questions must the question . 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
pleasure - he to the senators of adopt the motion ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
( the motion is agreed and the bill of bill is read a second time . ) 
referred to the committee 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
honourable senators , when shall - we this bill of bill a third time ? 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I move that the bill of bill S - 3 be referred to the committee Senate Standing of the Banking and of the trade . 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
pleasure - he to the senators of adopt the motion ? 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I attention that the last treaty tax which we we been before , the bill of bill S - 16 , has been referred to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
he captured the Vietnam , the Croatia and the Chile . 
the committee of the Affairs foreign has fact of the recommendations interesting on , between other things , the protection of the information personal and the ability of the country countries of to in implement with success the parties of the treaty . 
he would pity of rompre the continuity that the . find in the report of this committee in term of the bills of bill of nature similar to a other committee . 
I urge the Leader Deputy to reconsidered the question and to propose that the bill of bill be referred to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , for this who is of the precedents , to the over of the sat Parliament , two measures legislation regarding of the conventions tax , the projetsde bill C - per and S - 2 , have been examined by the committee of the Banking . 
in the second session of the sat Parliament , a treaty tax , the bill of bill C - 37 , has also been examined . 
he has also been referred to the committee Senate of the Banking . 
some have can - be a better memory that me on this about , but I must say , in any her , that . me has explained that the bill of bill had been referred to the committee of the Affairs foreign because that the committee of the Banking was surchargé of work . 
this is why , according me , the majority of the bills of bill , exception made of the bill of bill S - 16 , have been claimants to the committee of the Banking . 
honourable senators , if the committee of the Banking fact well the work , he can cerner all problem similar to those that the honourable senators have raised , in the framework of the debate on the bill of bill S - 3 . 
, the need , . can recommend that the bill of bill be referred to the committee of the Affairs foreign for there be more ample examined . 
I underscored still a time on the fact that he the is of a bill of bill business of the Senate . 
this not is not a bill of bill that we we received of the House . 
we we a little more of flexibility to this regard . 
I think that the fact of refer traditionally the treated tax to the committee of the Banking is useful because that the taxation is a aspect important of this bill of bill . 
this is the aspect the more important of the bill of bill , but the he is question of a country with which we not want not do case to because of the matter in the of respect of the rights of the human , that becomes a other aspect important . 
a country has been appointed , and of other the will to the over of the debate . 
however , the better way of proceed in this the is to study of first the considerations tax , then , to the need , to study the legislation to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
the hon. Consiglio Nino Nino : 
honourable senators , I think that this not is not very important to what committee this bill of bill is referred . 
however , the given that the bill of bill with primarily of the relations bilateral between two country , the committee of the Affairs foreign could be the who would the more qualified to the examine . 
can - be the Leader Deputy of the government will he of agreed with the recommendation that that the committee at the questions who have been raised to the Senate , be certainly the questions related to the rights of the human , but also the questions related to the confidentiality and the protection of the life privacy in the case of the trade of information with some of these States . 
, my notice , we not we not examined these questions to further the last time 
the senators here attendance understand all the problem . 
each of the committees can do the work and answer to the questions that we we raised . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , if the debate of yesterday and of today today must be taken to the seriously , this are then these questions regarding the rights of the human to the the international who Heads the attention during the debate of second Reading . 
unfortunately , the sponsor of the bill of bill , who has this the debate on the principle of the bill of bill , not the give same not the only of come debate the new questions and of we serve of guide . 
I I found education the debate of the the days . 
I I well from a report of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign 115 of the 28 May 1998 . - senator Lynch - Lynch there has fact referring . 
he the was of the Bill bill S - 16 , who greats to the which we are now before . 
in the sixth report of this committee , the members of the - this have said have two major concerns . 
of first , they have proposed that , before that the government of the Canada , a bill of bill similar in the future , the Department of the Affairs foreign and of the Trade international give the insurance to the Senate that he has by to a présélection of the country countries for whether their ability of implementation in implement successful of the agreements and conventions appropriate . 
our committee of the Affairs foreign the is already focused on this principle . 
the committee could very well decide that he must include in the bill of bill a clause on the respect of the rights of the human . 
I believe that this would a legislation welcome and Progressive . 
that framework all to fact with the direction general of our debate in second Reading . 
the committee of the Affairs foreign has already examined this solution in the case of a treaty similar . 
I am of agreed with the senator Hays on this that he has said to the about of the part tax because that the second recommendation was on the implementation in place of the systems of data tax necessary in the two country and on the protection of the information personal . 
the the of the debate who has had place to the Senate , he would all to fact indicated that the bill of bill be referred to the committee Senate of the Affairs foreign . 
I like same propose a amendment , if I the can , to least that the senator Hays not change of idea . 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , to my notice , the bill of bill should of first be referred before the committee of the Banking , who in étudierait the Main objective . 
he could then be referred to the committee of the Affairs foreign if this is this that the Senate wishes . 
some arguments very valid have been raised . 
I not I no objection to this that the committee of the Affairs foreign at the bill of bill , but he the could well that he there that had a présélection . 
he the could that he there that a good reason of include this country or some other country . 
the senator Nino Nino : 
want - you parier a dinner ? 
the senator Hays :

question of privilege 
the hon. Lise Bacon : 
honourable senators , I I given notice of my intention of raise the question of privilege to the about of the committee Senate Standing of the transport and of the Communications . 
as you the know without doubt , honourable senators , this committee Standing has been authorized to study the question of the restructuring of the industry of the transportation Air to the Canada pursuant to the order of referred of the Senate in date of the 14 October 99 . 
pursuant to the order of referred , the committee must present the report before the 15 December 99 . Service my Speaker , the committee has the 8 meetings public during made he has heard 53 witnesses . 
the week last , we we interrompu our hearings public and we began the study of the drafts of the report . 
we in are now to the third array . 
we we well taken be of avoid that any publicity be made on our deliberations . 
all the drafts were marquées " array " and " " " . 
during of our meeting on the first array , I I taken well be of distribute of the copies only to the senators attendance , copies that I I then allow to the end of the meeting . 
for the study of the second array , I I fact , , the that of our meeting , a copy to each senator member of the committee . 
contrary to the meeting before , by confidence to the integrity of the senators and of their assistants and that their let the possible of reflect more length to the content of the report , I not I not récupéré the copies of this second array of our report . 
yesterday last , few p.m. to only after the meeting of the committee , I I learned that a journalist of the Presse Canadian had in his possession a copy of the array number 2 of our report . 
the Soleil of Quebec , in the edition of this morning , publie a clause wrote by this same journalist of the Presse Canadian in which . can read , and I quote : 
in a report before be tabled tomorrow to the Senate , the members of the House high , Liberal and Conservatives , the are heard to of give to the carriers American the Authorized of ensure the Liaison air between various destinations Canadian ... ... ... 
and the journalist , by says of the committee of the transport and of the Communications , on the clause in writing : 
of the side , the Toronto Star has also released today today a clause in which . can read : : 
according our sources , . the is to this that the committee Senate , who is on the point of complete the report , move of to to 33,3p. per the per of the actions of Air Canada " be backgrounds by a only actionnaire , which is now of 10 per , and of to the per of the actions " be backgrounds by of the interests foreign to 49p. per , against 25 per now . 
I am prepared to table , if necessary , a copy of the Quorum where the sections mentioned have been reproduits . 
honourable senators , this identifies the they to the good conduct of the business current of the committee of the transport and Communications . 
well that the information étalées today today in the media people of a array of a report who not is always not finalisé , they now of teinter strongly the perception that will the public of our report final . 
as I the I already said , our report not is not debated . 
we must still discuss of several points . 
unfortunately , the identifies and the reactions that she provoquerait could entraver the reflection serene and enlightened of the members of the committee . 
beyond - beyond of the damage subis to the committee that I I the honour of chairman , a such identifies is damaging to the together of the business of the committees of the Senate . 
this is the confidentiality of our discussions who is in because , and , by the fact same , the ability of the senators to debate freely of the questions who we are référées . 
for do properly this that . we ask , we must have the certainty that the work that we effectuons to camera closed rest " . 
nothing of this who the is own in committee not must be quarrels before that the committee not that fact report to the House . 
in the same comment , . ' the comments following , and I quote : 
is a they to the privilege the fact of Issuance the deliberations of a committee held to camera closed or of the reports of committees before that they not have been the to the clause of the members . 
he is surprisingly that a such something so to the Senate , a institution responsible and transparent and who makes the publicly of his activities . 
he is therefore unacceptable that . sente the need of to need to the media of the documents who , of any way , would been people public when the decisions Strategy would been taken . 
unfortunately , this identifies just the add to of other events similar who the are déroulés recently to the within of our institution . 
the 14 September last , the senator Andreychuk has tabled a question of privilege that she has réintroduite the 13 October last to the about of a identifies who the would has to the committee Senate Standing of the Peoples aboriginal . 
I hope that we know we ressaisir to time for to a term to these incidents who reassessed the credibility of our institution . 
a would of respect and of collégialité has always régné to the within of the committee of the transport and of the Communications . 
I I a great respect for the members of the committee . 
this is why I am profoundly surprise that a such something can happen . 
I know how this identifies has could this produce . 
I not know not if this is of way intentionnelle , accidentelle or by neglect . 
however , this identifies has had place and is therefore , to my sense , a they to the privilege of the Senate . 
I ask that you statuiez in this sense . 
I be then in legislation of present the motion next : 
that the question be referred to the Committee Standing of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure for that he the inquiry . 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I support the motion which we are before . 
a audit with of the senators of our side has happened all the reports , we know where the find our copies . 
I not is human in particular . 
the senator Bacon has said that he could the act of a identifies by inadvertent or by neglect , or of a identifies deliberate . 
this who is important , in the case present , is that the case be referred to the committee , with the degree of priority that she deserves , to that he not there that no doubt that . has respected the decency . 
that we tirions the case to the clear or not any least that the risk potential . 
in this report , we about between other of the degree of control of Canadian by of the interests foreign or by a only actionnaire . 
that could give place to of the spéculations who could do wrong not only to the industry air and to the investors , but particularly to the confidence that the Canadians have opposite - to - opposite our institution and the manner which she opère . 
the hon. Serge Joyal : 
honourable senators , I like me associate to the comments of the senators Bacon and Forrestall . 
I I the privilege of participate to the business of the committee of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure . 
the question raised by the senator Bacon is of a some way already matter to our committee since the hon. senator Andreychuk has already raised a question similiaire he there has someone time . 
he there has therefore a virus in the system . 
if of such situations the proper to short deadline , this is that he there has certainly of the people in our group , . not knows not which , who not have not a idea specific of their responsibility . 
I me deregulation of draw your attention on the way which the Parliament of the Britain - Britain with of the questions similar . 
I like draw your attention on two decisions of the House of the Commons to London who have suspended pendant10 days , without salary , a member who had has the report of a committee before that the committee not that authorized his disclosure . 
this member , I the said , has been suspended during 10 days without salary . 
in a other case , who has been released in October last , two members have fact the subject of sanctions of the share of the committee of the House of the Commons British , the who has asked the report and the who the has given . 
the two have been the to the then , the two have been suspendus for of the periods reasonable . 
they have should the rise and present of the apologize to their colleagues to the House of the Commons British . 
this question is taken extremely to the seriously in our system Parliamentary and in the tradition who we stewardship . 
the reason in is simple , as the has explained the senator Bacon , and I quote the comments of the committee British : 
this is to this step that of the pressure External could be orchestrated for influence the findings of the report . 
if the less leaves there to this regard , all the system of the committees special could be has in question . 
no of our committees not could accomplish his task and do report to this House of a manner valid and responsible if , to the step important and crucial of the drafting of his reports , the drafts of those - this the centrist to Dnieper , excusez the expression , to left and to right approvals 
he is , by therefore , extremely important - and I taking my colleague , the senator DeWare , who fact part of the committee of the privileges , of the Réglement and of the procedure - that these questions , who have been raised by the senator Andreychuk and the senator Bacon , so do the subject of a study of the share of the committee . 
we could and we hear not only on the Ethics that we we engagerons all to follow but also , unfortunately , on the system of sanctions that we should to in place for the ensure that of the incidents unfortunate of this nature not the proper more . 
this is therefore in this wish , honourable senators , that I like support the comments of the senators Bacon and Forrestall . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I like add few words . 
he is unfortunate that the question of privilege be raised to new to comments of facts almost identiques . 
I about , well course , of the question of privilege raised by the senator Andreychuk with of the committee Standing of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure . 
I add that she seems rather explicit , the the of the precedent where the Speaker , to to decide if a question of privilege was based , has quoted the comment 877 , to the page 250 of the sixth edition of the 286 Parliamentary of Beauchesne , who for : : 
nothing of this who the is own in committee not must be quarrels before that the committee not that fact report to the House . 
and still : 
is a they to the privilege the fact of Issuance the deliberations of a committee held to camera closed or of the reports of committees before that they not have been the to the clause of the members . 
in consequential , Honour the , that seems rather explicit and I you urge also to consider this case as based to that she be referred to the committee Standing of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure . 
the hon. Joan Fraser : 
honourable senators , I want support me also the motion of the senator Bacon . 
this is the identifies and not the publication who is to condemn . 
the hon. Anne C . Cools : 
honourable senators , I like participate very briefly to the debate . 
the subject of this debate must be perfectly clear . 
the debate is to convince the Speaker that he there has is and well had they to the privilege and that she must give here the any first priority to this question . 
for support this that her the senator Bacon has said , I me commend of the initiative , and I the thank of have statement the facts . 
in of other words , the content of the bills of report not must not be quarrels to the media and to the public before the Tabled of the report to the Senate . 
needless of the say , this problem seems to without has and same take of the magnitude , and he is obvious that he demands our attention . 
I attention that the senator Andreychuk has raised a question similar the 14 September . 
I believe have participated to this debate . 
of new , the 13 October , the senator Andreychuk has raised the same problem , and I him I managed " my support . 
the true question who the there to we , honourable senators , is the of know the he there has présomption of they to the privilege . 
I say to Honour the that of many senators seem be of this notice . 
decision of the Speaker 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
honourable senators , if no other senator not to take the speak , I rendrai my decision . 
I like thank the senator Bacon and all the honourable senators who have participated to the debate . 
I me recall that the senator Molgat , to the months of September last , had been before of a question similar . 
I accept therefore the question of privilege raised by the senator Bacon . 
I move that the question be referred to the committee Standing of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure for that he the inquiry . 
you pleasure - he , honourable senators , of adopt the motion ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
( the motion is agreed . ) 
the freedom religious in China in report with the pactes international of the Nations Nations 
inquiry - Adjourned of the debate 
the hon. LoisM. Wilson the the speak pursuant to the notice of inquiry following presented the 17 November 99 : 
- honourable senators , of the 23 October to the 5 November last , a delegation of seven people hosted by the Council Canadian of the Églises has examined , with the assistance of the Department of the Affairs foreign and of the Trade international , the challenges are our partners Chinese are opposite in the practice religious in China . 
the delegates , who are the major Églises chrétiennes to the Canada , have widely puisé in their history institutionnelle centennial with their partners Chinese for study the protection of the freedom religious in China . 
among the contacts ultérieurs possible , notons a meeting between a delegation Canadian interconfessionnelle and a group interconfessionnel in China , and a meeting to the Tibet . 
the delegation the is made that in the spirit of the commitment moreover , in the purpose of share of the points of view on the way which of the laws with the freedom of religion can the the obligations international for to the words of the two pactes of the Nations Nations debates to the rights of the man that the China contemplated of ratify . 
the delegation " that she was she - same the to a of the many agreements bilateral conclude between the Canada and the China and that she had complements the missions of assessment of the needs sent in China by the Upper Commissioner of the Nations Nations to the rights of the man , Mary Packwood . 
that offer a program overall of cooperation technical in the Administration of the justice , the reform legislative and of other areas of the rights of the human . 
during these two weeks , the delegation has visited six cities and discussed of questions with a broad wide of representatives of the Church and of the government , there including the under - Minister of the Affairs foreign of the China and the steering of the Board of the Affairs religious . 
the or Nations who them primarily on the persecution religious in China , the arrests and the détentions arbitraires , and that the abuses of the rights of the human , are were to across the peel of our culture . 
the arrests of people for of the ; political are ensued without no explanation , if this not is that . specific that the these have breached the bill Chinese , and this is generally perceived by the Canadians as a violation of the freedom of religion and of the rights of the man . 
some of these or are without no doubt greatest . 
this is the side dark of the life of the communities religious in China . 
however , . not specific never this that the laws and the regulations with the religion say and the reasons for which they have been the in place and why of the sanctions are for for those who the own . 
the provision of the Republic popular of China result of a history would by the confucianisme , the revolution marxiste and the need of control , of ensure the stability and the order in the management of a country who has 1.3 billion of people and a history and a context well different of the ours . 
the delegation not has never visited a city who had least of 10 million of people . 
the provision guarantees the freedom of belief of the citizens and protects the activities religious normal . 
however , she not guarantees not the freedom of the croyants of appreciation or of be this belief and not define not not more this that . does by the activities religious normal if this not is for say that human not can use the religion for the thoughts to of the activities who perturbent the order public . 
this zone grise ask some of the line that the Chinese do to the freedom religious which we go speak in Troops and , to because of this doubt , those who are law of administering the regulations , particularly in of the regions local very éloignées of Beijing , can exorbitant of these provisions . 
the provision specific also clear that the agencies church not are not submitted to someone form of mother foreign that this be . 
that the to the fact that the China redoute the intentions of the community religious international who has the to difficulty his sovereignty in the past . 
the the of the direction strongly privatized of groups church back of Zion only the salut individual in a country who efficiently many of price to the community , particularly when these groups come of Los Angeles or of Taiwan , they there are by as a meddling foreign . 
two ending of regulations allow of ensure to this that the religion not become not a source of déstabilisation or of threat to the security national . 
the regulations clauses of a interpretation according which the freedom is associated to of the rights actions ; in Troops , however , . the more the focus on the rights individual . 
each centre of activity religious is the of the of with of the government and of satisfy to six criteria , be be a place of culte , a leader up , a sure number of adhérents , a committee of management , a source legal of income and a behalf for a place of meeting . 
he is important of attention that in China , all group social is the of the of with of the government , prerequisite who not the limit not to the groups church . 
that the recorded in the fact that the . the the focus on the rights actions . 
of fact , the Art of the Science Social of of has said that the Christian were of good citizens Chinese . 
our partners of the Church protestante have up the Council redemption of China , a church post - confessionnelle to the within of which the people seniors the say of former Presbyterians , of former anglicans , and and of the . 
this church is fully Chinese in the legislation where she is his origins of the movement said " Three - Self Patriotic " , all as he in will of his Economy , of his Finance and of his sinful . 
the partners grab in the regulations a legislation of protection of their activities and a guarantee against any meddling of the share of Chinese not croyants , as that the is happened during the revolution cultural . 
through to this protection , the churches protestantes of China are a growth blend and their Main problem is to form enough of leaders of ability for satisfy to the ask . 
we we met a young woman who , by example , after have received a training of three months , is now - of the direction spiritual de1 $ people . 
well that minority in China , the Christian of this country are far more many that the Christian to the Canada . 
the situation of the Catholic is different . 
the churches Catholic parcels are désignées under the behalf of Church patriotique and they support the political government , by example the policy on the child unique . 
that night to the recruitment of the their , since little of families accept that their only child choisisse this service , empêchant the transmission of the behalf of family , same if their " could be " Chinese and Catholic to share full " . 
those who , by choice or by the force of the things , the Subcommittee for prier to the within of groups not registered can the do for several reasons : the allegiance of the croyants to a authority or a influence foreign ; the refusal of be confiné to a only place of meeting ; the refusal of the put to the authority of the association of the Chinese Catholic patriotiques or of the Council Chinese of the churches chrétiennes ; or finally the acceptance of the education and of the practices hétérodoxes may of threaten the order public . 
he there has also the cultes . 
the Chinese are very well the cultes who exist to the Canada and , to the Art of the Science Social , a professor we has reported to the about of the culte known under the behalf of the " boon of Toronto " , established close of the airport Pearson and which you you can - be already heard speak . 
no of we not the knew directly , if well that we we we proud to of the . - said for answer to the questions . 
the China has any a bill on the cultes the last day of our visit . 
all our partners without exception , of same that the government , indicated the Falun Gong as a organization déstabilisatrice , nuisible and to influence foreign . 
according them , this organization is very popular with of the Chinese least educated and more vulnerable , who are can - be still isolated of the modernization and of the benefits of the medicine modern . 
our delegation not has not taken Position on the Aristotle of the movement Falun Gong . 
during of our meeting with the under - Minister of the Affairs foreign , Yang Jiechi , I I fact of of various concerns to the behalf of the Minister of the Affairs foreign of the Canada . 
first , I I said that the Canadians the inquiétaient many of the arrests , of the détentions , of the bad treatment and of the abuse ill to the " of the Falun Gong , which the behaviour public has been not own and copy during their observe ininterrompues . 
since the Constitution would to the citizens the right of believe or of not not believe , . has the Appendix , to the Canada , that the Constitution not is not respected . 
as and how board - they clear this that is a " activity religious normal " ? 
second , the implementation in implement of the new bill on the cultes will she rétroactive ? 
third , how the community international can - she be assured that the people opinionated will right to a trial equitable and public ? 
what scope have the two pactes of the Nations Nations , signés by the China in 1997 and 1998 , but not still ratifiés , on the treatment should to the members of the Falun Gong ? 
these questions , of same that well of other that I not I not the time of raise during this short inquiry , not have always not found of answers unsatisfactory , but may a possible of continue our cooperation with the China to the about of the freedom religious , the the of the conventions international . 
we anticipate that he there will of other delegations and of other trade on the questions related to the faith and to the freedom religious and on the application of a policy regarding the religion , pursuant to the conventions international . 
we think that this approach is more facility that a approach who raises of the growing . 
we hope welcome to the Canada a delegation of representatives of the Board of the Affairs religious for alters our understanding step of the relations between the Church and the state and for élucider with them the mystery , to know why the Canada not has not need of a office of the Affairs religious . 
we anticipate also welcome a delegation of researchers of the Art Chinese of the Science Social , who , of together with our academic , can alters our understanding step of the religion in a society not confessionnelle . 
( on the motion of the senator Wilson , to the behalf of the senator Austin , the debate is adjourned . )

Churchill wrote that the " of the famous founding , " Sois prepared " is precipitancy by all as a invitation to do the duty . 
am prepared to defend the right and the truth , against kind and marées . 
honourable senators , in struck the documents spent to the wonderful career of the senator Derek Lewis , . . . - a life public so to the service and to the duty - , I I found how the influence of the baron Baden - Powell the had dismantling . 
Derek has been during well of the years a of the pillars of the Boy Scouts of the Canada , to been during a time the Secretary of the organization national , and he in is today today a of the vices - chairmen for to life . 
the senator Lewis , all the other honourable senators the know , is a human very modest . 
some could same the what of Baden - Powell of Newfoundland - Newfoundland . 
the legendary to that , to the time where the senator Lewis servait in the boy scouts , the senator Joan Cook , who is today today his next of Chair , was member of the along of Newfoundland - Newfoundland . 
during these long years of service he , the senator Lewis has spent his efforts to the too of the full potential of the young and to the creation of citizens responsible - of the individuals to the values axées on the interest of the community and of their country - without never losing of view the community international . 
the " of Baden - Powell , " Sois prepared " or " Be Prepared " , who 1 to his robust and who means " am always prepared mentalement and physiquement to do their duty " has been the of this distinguished senator that I I always been if proud of power what of real friend during all these years . 
the senator has been admitted to the Society of Newfoundland - Newfoundland in 1947 , two years only before that this nation , small but ô how important , not wants of the join to the Confederation Canadian . 
this year where we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of this union , we say unfortunately to the bye to the a of his son and clubbers the more outstanding , a man who has the all the ability of a people warmest , résistant and dynamic , the people of Newfoundland - Newfoundland , to the service of the life policy of this country . 
placed St. John s and lawyer respected , the senator Lewis has made the sense of the humour well known and the with to negotiate and to do of the compromise to the Senate of the Canada during of his appointment in March 1978 . 
when I I met the senator Lewis for the first time through to the policy - a way day of do knowledge for number of between we - Derek had been to Newfoundland - Newfoundland steering or counsel Main of many campaigns electoral federal . 
the dedication and the reliability of the senator Lewis are well known in this place . 
he has been member of virtually all the committees who have been constitués by the Senate and was being for the way infallible that he had of work with the other members for happen to a consensus on of the measures legislation often complex . 
the list is long and impressive , and he is important of in do of . 
during three years , between 1984 and 1986 , he has chaired the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , which he is member without interruption since 1979 . 
he has fact part of the committee Standing of the Rules and of the procedure or , as . the Order since 1991 , of the committee Senate Standing of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure , during a period to little close also long , be a little more of two decades . 
the senator Lewis has fact benefit of the very great know policy the committee Standing of the regulatory and of the other Statutory regulatory . 
he has chaired the committee Joint Standing of review of the regulatory during the more great part of the , decade . 
he has often fact part of the committee Joint of the impressions of the Parliament and of the committee Joint Special of the reform of the Senate , who has been up to the beginning of the years 80 . 
, this list already very long and remarkable just the add the participation of the senator Lewis to the business of the committee Joint Special on the Entente constitutional of 1987 and to the committee Special of the bill of bill C - 110 ( changes Constitutional ) of 1994 to 1996 . 
he not there has therefore not place of the surprise that this " Newfoundland - Newfoundlander to the spirit alerte and to the songs spontané that learning a of the best insinuation who be among all the people to never served to the House . 
he is renowned for the generosity with which he implementation the time , the soul and the energy to the service of his province and of the country . 
in quality of senator , he has always including that the Senate of the Canada , as I the said without has , is the place of work of the government , a NRTEE to the within which he the is win the respect and the admiration of all of the two sides of the House . 
for Derek Lewis , who has fact as of they in the movement scout to the country , the seaway of the success the is always only résumée to do the duty , to pagayer , as the has already said Baden - Powell , with the heart and his head and to be prepared , as the senator Lewis the has always been , to defend faithfully the right and the truth , what that be the context . 
right and truth . 
duty and honour . 
justice and equity . 
these words décrivent of way very valid our colleague who we leaving . 
he is of out also the support of the wife of the senator Lewis , the reinvent Grace , who is of the ourselves today today in the gallery of the visitors . 
we are many in this chamber to have very long bénéficié of their friendship warm and of their hospitality generous . 
all our best the accompanies in their new businesses . 
the hon. C . William Doody : 
honourable senators , I like to my turn add my good best to those views by my colleagues to the opportunity of the departure to the retirement of our friend Derek Lewis . 
I know the senator Lewis since 20 years and same before , to the time where we were St. John s . 
this is a man who fate guarantee of the plain . 
I then do saying that , during all these years , he not me has never been given of hear the less criticism or the less criticized to the any . 
that is of as more remarkable that he has has the right with success during any this period . 
but the more remarkable still , this is that , addition his practice of the right with the success that the . knows , he has actively behind for the Party Liberal of the Canada , this that he continues of , to this day . 
I not me recall not of a campaign election , federal or provincial , to which the senator Derek not that not participated actively . 
in the victory or the defeat , Derek was always a gentleman , poli , well high , well the and méticuleux to the so . 
in fact , I I already heard say St. John s that the time the more embarrassant in the life of Derek , this is when he the is fact take a day with the cravate defeat . 
little any the opportunity , that he earner or that he perde , all his activities were always marquées by a nice one of humour kind and sardonique who , according me , was particular to Derek Lewis . 
, the Senate , I think that . the he particularly of him for the work to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional . 
the senator Graham has very well enumerated , to fair as , the broad wide of activities which Derek has participated in this chamber . 
he has made a work invaluable to the committee of the Affairs legal , and his great knowledge of the right and that the approach all to fact practice and deliberately to the regard of the business of the committee and the tasks that . him included will difficult to replace . 
the attendance of the senator Lewis in this chamber is , well heard , a something which we can all be proud and that we should attempt of follow . 
. not in about not to my knowledge in the book of Claire Hoy , but I not me forward not to this that this kind of something draw many the attention of any way . 
I I sat with Derek to the committee Senate Standing of the Economy Economy , of the Budgets and of the Administration during long and , that still , the work to the committee not will not forgotten , particularly by your servant . 
the work of Derek to Newfoundland - Newfoundland in his profession has been dismantling by the same dedication and included of the detail . 
his career in as that lawyer has been whose during long by his our . 
he has been counsel of the notaires of the Law Society of Newfoundland of 1962 to 1978 . 
he is became chairman of the Law Honorary of Newfoundland in 1979 . 
honourable senators , Derek Lewis ( the right in the province of Newfoundland - Newfoundland since 1947 . 
this was little after the episode of the Confederation which the senator Graham has spoke . 
I trying still of determine if Derek was in favour of the Confederation or not . 
he refuses of the say . 
sometimes , he said that he is a Canadian to reluctantly . 
he the fact to the past , but I know exactly this that that to say . 
I trying of discover to the fair the he was for or against , because , as the honourable senators the in recall , the vote was very tie and he there has can - be of the ; for proceed to a new recount . 
Derek Lewis has played a role active in the Affairs of our province and of our city . 
the work with of the Boy Scouts of the Canada has been mentioned . 
he is very recognized to Newfoundland - Newfoundland for that and for the work in the Game Fish Mammals Society of our province and in various other agencies volunteers who are very important for the evolution orderly of the society to Newfoundland - Newfoundland . 
in effect , Derek has played a role active in almost all . 
he has generously given the time each time that . the him has asked and we him in are all grateful . 
I not copyright not in the details of the work of the senator Lewis for the Party Liberal , because the senator Graham is many better put that me for the do . 
of , , that not appear not also flatteur from of me . 
I wish to Derek and to Grace of good years of retirement . 
I included to that the wish that he take break of the Party Liberal as of the Senate , and : for of the reasons evident . 
thank , Derek . 
the hon. Joan Cook : 
honourable senators , to those of between we who their to the life public in graduated that he is possible of to a change who guarantee a better quality of life to all , he enough of look my colleague and friend , the senator Derek Lewis . 
he has a force quiet , a uniqueness extraordinary and a intellect outside of the common . 
as Derek not lack no opportunity of me the remind , the brevity is the soul of the intellect ; I say therefore simply that my association with his woman and him covers quelque30 years political agitées . 
the challenges have been many and diverse and we we known of the senior and of the there . 
if I écrivais a book to this about , I can ensure to the senator Doody that this would a best - seller . 
during this period , Derek was the trésorier provincial of the Party Liberal . 
the candidates and the workers of campaign election who unleashing of the money believed all that with enough of money , they could win the victory . 
I know that he has a patience of ange because that . the has very often the to the when in this sense . 
each time that we were défaits , Grace was always that , prepared to we comfort and to we do forget our only in we gavant of biscuits to the gingembre . 
all of first , he said that . not could not do the impossible and then , that this not was not the money who Pedro the victory and that the . earned when the constituents had confidence in we . 
also , I like repeating these words immortelles that has prononcées fire Don Jamieson in issue of the heritage of Newfoundland - Newfoundland , because that they you décrivent if well : 
Derek and Grace , I you wish of not never change and of have still during long the over in the canoe . 
the hon. Ethel Cochrane : 
honourable senators , I am désolée of see the senator Lewis we leave . 
I know that we we always he of the seats interestingly to the Senate , but , from all two of Newfoundland - Newfoundland , we we often been neighbours of seat in the of and we we also often lived together of the delay and of the changes of itinéraire . 
I not knew not the senator Lewis before of happen to the Senate . 
he had of the Coast is of Newfoundland - Newfoundland and me of the Coast west , to more of 1 $ kilometres of distance . 
the senator Lewis me has many help to extension these first months . 
he me has served of guide during this period and he has continued to the over of the years of me give of binge advice , and all that all to fact gratuitement . 
I not I never seen the senator Lewis déprimé . 
what that be the time to the outside or the concerns political to the within , . could always be on Derek Lewis for we back the moral . 
he has a ability remarkable for the remind of the blagues and for the recount to the good time . 
. not knows never to what the expect with him and he can recount the blagues the more drôles without same esquisser a smile . 
despite the spirit and the humour which he was evidence with of his friends , Derek Lewis was always very was in public . 
he has always maintained jalousement his life privacy and not has never sought to do great fanfare of the work and of his contribution . 
he has who well succeeded in his life public , in as that Solicitor of funds for the great Party Liberal , member of the executive national of the party and negligible faithful and seriously to the business of the Senate . 
during of many years , he has served the party , the people of Newfoundland - Newfoundland and of the Labrador and that the Parliament of way effective and effacée , without never seek to to in flagship his own accomplishments . 
before of be appointed to the Senate , Derek Lewis was a distinguished lawyer who practised St. John s . 
he was enormous respected and admired in the community . 
, the beginning of his career , he the is associated to Finton Aylward and to John you . 
this is therefore a Liberal am who the is associated to the very Conservative Finton Aylward , became by the the Justice to Newfoundland - Newfoundland and to the Labrador , and to a young John you , who has known a proceed career in as that Minister to the within of a government Conservative federal and who is today today Chancellor to the University Memorial . 
who knows this that Derek Lewis would work the he had seen clear during his Sexually and had changed of allegiance policy ? 
I am course that his colleagues of this study the join to we for address their best best to Derek . 
Derek and the wife , Grace , have a home on the Lake Hogans , St. John s . 
I know that , during the been , they unhappy the baigner all the legalities in this Lake . 
I hope that they continue of benefit of the Lake Hogans and of all the other wonders of Newfoundland - Newfoundland and of the Labrador during of long years . 
god you bénisse , Derek . 
the hon. Joyce Fairbairn : 
honourable senators , this is a day sad for the Senate that the where we must say Adieu to a colleague as the senator Derek Lewis , who has enormous contributed to the business of this legislative during more of 20 years . 
he the is victorious a place special to the Senate , as by the work that he has work that by the influence on of the people as me - same , the senator Cochrane and as of other , who have canvassed his advice and the support in their efforts for better understand and do communications our role in this chamber . 
the Newfoundland - alter , and more particularly the senator Lewis , Whelans to the Parliament and in all case to the Senate a point of view and a attitude well different of those of the other provinces , a so of fraîcheur Shipping who the to their history , the of the last province to the be " to the Confederation , this that she has fact the 31 March 1949 , to midnight least ten . 
we we many learned of our colleagues of Newfoundland - Newfoundland . 
we the we trusting discuss of the benefits and of the inconvénients of their new nationalité . 
I I certainly bénéficié of the intensité of the patriotism that they have made to the Canada without abandon a once of the emotion and of the pride who is to their home attends . 
Derek Lewis not is not a great parleur ; this is a man of action . 
he listening and he evaluated . 
when he finit by take the speak , that this be to the Senate or to the very many committees where he has sat , he the fact with be , wisdom and brevity . 
I I also noticed to the over of the years that he not lâche not . 
he is as a terrier with a routine , the he believe that a witness or a colleague his someone something or esquive a question . 
I the I taken during of the years for model to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional . 
when of great and difficult problems have surgi to the Senate in the matter constitutional of the changes to to to the system school of Newfoundland - Newfoundland , he me has given of very asset advice . 
the senator Lewis is a lawyer who has been described by none other that the party land - neuvien , John you , as " a man quiet , but a great spirit legal " . 
he not am not not more to in do the démonstration . 
he not was hardly more that a noviciate to the Senate that he was of change our institution in as that member of the committee Joint Special of the reform of the Senate , under the Speaker of our Speaker present , the senator Molgat , in 1983 . 
the senator Lewis has also métamorphosé the committee Joint of the review of the regulatory , to the business before ploughing and same incompréhensibles of the notice of some , in a form of his , causant of the dismay in some as home of the people who the were endormis in a false security in graduated that human not there prêtait really the less attention . 
as of other the have fact out , the senator Lewis has been member of almost all the committees important of the Senate ; all recently , he was the a of the personnagesclés of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign . 
however , in despite of his great experience and of the an sense of his responsibilities to the Senate , this is of his kindness , of his generosity , of the sense precinct of the justice and of his compassion to those who are least their that we which I me shall when I penserai to my friendship with the senator Lewis . 
well that he that before with enthusiasm the opportunity of serve the public , he not has never forgotten of where he had not more that the needs and the force of the people of Newfoundland - Newfoundland , his province well - rock , who him voue a great admiration . 
of , , to the within of my own party , the Party Liberal , . not will not St. John s without call Derek . 
what that be his for of work , or the time , he is always that for you . 
I I brossé a picture rather angélique of my sir colleague , but I will also out that he has a sense of the humour endiablé , that this is a great storyteller , and that he not dédaigne not a good rasade of rhum . 
he has said that the human that his retirement leadership the more is the wife Grace , who the has always seconded without défaillance , same when he the is launched in a new career who him has fact leave the Island regularly , week after week , during the two last decades . 
that in said long on the links who the bonds . 
I their wish to all two of many years of happiness together . 
Derek not has not still decided to what challenges he would now the deal , but , what that they be , I the encourage to not not abandon the tricot .

the hon. Lorna Milne : 
honourable senators , let - me of share with you few other stories to the about of the hon. senator Derek Lewis , to begin by the time where we we are from of friendship , I believe . 
. the would thought in a conte of Edgar Allan Poe : " revision a night monotone , where I broyais of the says ... " 
well course , the time not was not all to fact also unbecoming , but I was only in my office , to the mezzanine of the Senate , about four months after have been appointed to this House , and I commençais to in have a little marre . 
this last - that , . has struck doucement to the the of my office . 
this was the senators Lewis and Bonnell . 
Derek has said : " We Pension you find still here and we we ask the he you plairait of we with in China . " 
he not had virtually not last his sentence that I had the paletot on the walk and that I franchissais the the . 
since this day , Ross and me are their of the friends sincere , I believe , of Derek and of the " her Grace " . 
in fact , we shock of the see too little since few years , because that she is very dynamic . 
I I appreciate all the times that we we been together . 
he was always present and usually to the time . 
he former until to the any end of each sitting . 
each time that the interrogation of a client innocently to languir , he possession a question who ranimait the discussion and who newcomers a perspective completely new on the bill of bill to the study or can - be same a assure unforeseen . 
all chairman of committee knows to what point he is important that the good motion be introduced to the good time , and . could always be on Derek for that . 
the sense of the to - comments has always been absolutely such and the notice on the deliberations of the committee , perfectly definitive , because , as of other the have already said , the know of Law is fault . 
as all the Newfoundland - alter of more of 50 years , Derek has the of the time to become Canadian . 
in effect , he the is became to the body defending . 
I believe that he has voted to the least a time against the into of Newfoundland - Newfoundland in the Confederation . 
in fact , he people that this was a very bad idea . 
a time that the Canada is was to Newfoundland - Newfoundland , however , he the is interested to the policy Canadian with enthusiasm - with sometimes a little too of enthusiasm , can - be . 
Derek , I hope that you écrivez a book . 
not let not that to the senator Cook ! 
racontez the frasques to the world , the time where you you College the ordures to the nose of the troops of your former associated in your study of lawyers and this that you you already the in the coffre - very of the office . 
well course , that back to the time détestable where Derek was associated with a sure John you , who has already been a Liberal famous or malfamé of the other place . 
I me hasten of add that Derek is today today many more make , to this that he said , of the least . 
Derek , sir friend , the number of the people who have said here today today that they s you miss in said long on the kind of human that you are . 
I know that you me missed angry . 
you advice are , your assistance definitive and your wonderful and distinct sense of the humour will me be .

the hon. Consiglio Nino Nino :

you you can - be noticed that , when we we rencontrons , we we giving the with left rather that the right . 
this not is not the sign of a society secrète , but the of a magnificent society who has many fact to the Canada . 
the senator Lewis is since long a member he and zélé of the movement scout , a passion that we share . 
this movement has underlined his contribution of well of the ways , including in the him recently chairman - chairman Honorary of the body national , a honour who me has also been Search .

the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
honourable senators , 
these words , writing by Rudyard Kipling , not have of any obviously not been writing in believing to Derek Lewis , but he was the act of someone a as Derek Lewis . 
honourable senators , to the Senate , we produced the formula " honourable colleagues " in we ability the each to the other , but human here not is more hon. that Derek Lewis . 
Derek Lewis was , and is always , a man very kind . 
he is far am that his achievements , and he in has known several , are account only to the work and to his efforts . 
the senator Lewis not has never thought necessary of use the other for , to his for personal . 
. not would never could any Derek of act to the backs of someone a in the hope of current him - same , because Derek believer to the contrary that he enrichirait his own life in by the other . 
same if Derek has succeeded as lawyer and Parliamentary , I the see particularly as a man generous , with a sense of the humour grows , who has always been that for me support , to his manner understanding , but clear . 
when I I chaired the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , with the senator Nolin to my sides as chairman - chairman , the senator Lewis was the other member of the committee steering . 
when I I been Leader Deputy of the government to the Senate , I knew that he was always that , prepared to help quiet but résolument . 
Derek and Grace have graciously received all the members of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional to Hogans Pond , Newfoundland - Newfoundland , when we we are people in this province for there study the question of the system school . 
as Derek the knew very well , I had few reserves to the about of this amendment . 
I must by that I would well more of contrarier Derek that of contrarier the government . 
Derek will me be to this place . 
the too little phone visits of Grace to Ottawa will also me be . 
I their wish of many years of a retirement pleased , together , in their province adorée , including to Hogans Pond . 
I hope that we resterons in touch because that the good friends are few and that they are the best friends of all those who the are . 
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , to the opportunity of his retirement , we which today today tribute to our friend Derek Lewis , the man modest and quiet of Newfoundland - Newfoundland who has fact a long and famous career to the Senate . 
not is - this not a opportunity all route for take the time of we remind the balance delicate that the Senate supports in our life public and that the principles discrets , almost invisible , who their our work here important and dignified of faith ? 
when I am come to Ottawa for the first time in 1966 , for work as Leader of s of a Minister , . me has explained that he was essential that I me seek on the work of the Senate . 
I knew very little of things on the way which the Senate operated . 
by a day ensoleillée of July , I I asked a Boteler - you , by the through of Torrance Wiley , with a old friend who was then Deputy executive of the hon. John Connolly , the powerful Leader of the government to the Senate . 
. me has immediately guest to the meet . 
I am went in the magnificent office of out lambrissé and well enlightened located in opposite of the Senate , of the other side of the chorus , office that ' now the present Leader of the government to the Senate . 
close of two decades more later , when I I had the opportunity of be appointed Senate , a old friend , the senator jack , the father of John jack , to the other place , the is immediately the in report with me . 
the senator jack me has has the book Red of the Rules of the Senate and he me has said : : " Respectez the Rules and the Senate you keeping . " 
little after , the Scotians - Brunswickois to the frank - speak , the senator McElman , me has said that the work of the committees , this was the soul of the Senate . 
he me has reminded that , same if the most of between we had a allegiance to a party , we could remodeler a bad policy government quiet , without amidst or amidst , by the through of the deliberations of the committees Senate . 
he me has exhorté to work very to the within of the committees . 
then I I met the senator Ian Sinclair who , to the time , had all fair of be appointed to the Senate . 
before , he was , with gracefully , the duties of steering General of the Canadian Pacific , a of the more major companies of the Canada , and he was a legendary article in the as of the Affairs . 
the senator Sinclair has said that the experience in the Affairs him had learned that the better work - and , therefore , the better work fact to the Senate - is the who is chosen by the senators them - same . 
he has said that a good work to the Senate and in the committees apporterait his own award under form of satisfaction personal . 
finally , the senator MacEachen of the Nova - Nova - a former Leader of the government to the Senate - me has reminded to again occasions , and has reminded to all the senators of this side - this , that to of maintain our own credibility and the of the Senate , we we keep our disappear with the other place to the across of the corridor and that the other place of the other side of the street . 
the echoes of his advice the are fact hear to the Senate not more later that yesterday , when the senator Murray has raised the question of the study pre . 
the senator MacEachen the is firmly opposed to the study pre of the initiatives business , because she had for effect undesirable of reduce the credibility of the Senate in as that House of reflection , in as that House independent of the other place , of the other place of the other side of the street , in as that House independent to our own " and to those of the public to the service which we are . 
by therefore , to my sense , honourable senators , he must respect to the Senate a delicate balance between the principles . 
the flame of the power of the other place is always attirante , but if we we in scenes too , our work and the Senate him - same now of be quickly down in cendres . 
this are the first principles that I I glanés to the about of the Senate . 
the principles and the practice must go of hand . 
all that , honourable senators , in way of preamble to the tribute that I want to to my good friend Derek Lewis , who we leaving for a retirement well deserved . 
, my " , Derek has incarné all these principles . 
he comply our institution . 
he has learning a knowledge encyclopaedic of the rules of the Senate and respected his biodegradable . 
in the business of the committees , he was the artisan by excellence . 
Derek was was , méticuleux , appropriate , witty and thought . 
he is always was to distance respectueuse of the power . 
in a word , Derek was the senator by excellence and the lawyer by excellence . 
in this sense , he is a representative of a resources of more in more rare to the Senate . 
for all these reasons and for his company who we will , the departure decide a great vacuum to the Senate . 
Derek , you are to the across of your with . 
your work is work . 
you and Grace méritez widely of live a pleased retirement in good health . 
as . said in the tradition Jewish : " Puissiez - you live in good health until to 120 years . " 
god you bénisse . 
the hon. Landon Pearson :

the hon. P . Derek Lewis : 
honourable senators , I thank the senators for their tributes . 
same if this was in great part waited , I not contesterai nothing , particularly not the kind comments held to my regard . 
I aside this be to of other . 
I I had the privilege of be member of this House during a little more of 21 years . 
I I many appreciate of have had the possible of me associate to of the colleagues also various , informed and made , and I in am honoured . 
during the years that I I fellow here , I me am fact several friends families which I chérirai always the friendship . 
I I taken happy to work with the senators of the two sides of the House . 
my only regret , this is that the circumstances me have forced this last year of limit someone little my activities and of not have could therefore better do knowledge with the senators appointed recently to the Senate . 
he was a time where I not me souciais or of the world of the policy or of his players . 
however , when I me there am interested of close in me involving personally , I I quickly including all those who rely on this who and learned to sympathiser with them . 
, the departure , this is the curiosity who me has forced to take share to the life policy . 
as some of between you the know , a time that . the involved in a bill , . the find committed in a twofold who go of more in more quickly , and . finit by become accroché . 
some activities parliamentarians were if imprévisibles that I me unsure sometimes lost . 
he appropriate , to my notice , of to in place a program of direction to the intention of the senators newly appointed , not only for explain the procedure , but also for the inform of the different services and facilities the to their clause . 
in well of the case , I not I discovered these things that after have asked the question to of the colleagues , as the has fact the senator Cook . 
this is really pity , since this information is available , to the condition of know where the seek . 
, the over of the years , many of new senators have expressed the same concerns . 
I believe know that , since few years , of the measures have been taken for improve the things . 
he is personally important that the new senators the familiarisent as that possible with the Rules of the Senate . 
I I participated during of many years to the business of different committees and I I many appreciate the experience , well that this was sometimes difficult . 
I I been Right impressed by the quality and the exhaustivité of the reviews are we we livrions . 
as of other before me the have fact having , the work in committee is the a of the activities the more important of the Senate . 
I think including to two committees in particular . 
a of the first committees are I I participated has been the committee Joint of the review of the regulatory . 
he the was differently to the time . 
work with the staff and the representatives of the committee was a happy . 
they work if well the work ennuyeux who is to study and to excellent of the regulations and of the procedure . 
, the within of this committee , I I shifted under various chairmen which , of the side of the Senate , the former senators Lafond , Forsey , jack and Nurgitz , and that the senator Grimard . 
our chairman in year is the senator Hervieux - Hervieux . 
I I also co during a sure time this committee . 
I I also been during very long member of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , who has always been a of the committees the more busy of the Senate . 
I I had the happy of côtoyer of the chairmen as the former senators Stanbury , , and Nurgitz , and that the senators Beaudoin , Carstairs and Milne . 
the work of this committee was very interesting and important . 
the leadership has by the people to he the Speaker has enormous contributed to the accomplishments of the committee . 
I speak now briefly the question of the reform of the Senate who , since the time same of his creation , fact the subject of many of discussions and of controversy . 
I note that little after my appointment here , the question of a reform to to do of the Senate a body elected has of new surgi . 
in 1980 , a committee Joint of the two Houses of the Parliament has been established to of study of the ways which the Senate could be reformed in view of strengthen the role of representative of the people of all the regions . 
I I been appointed to this committee , who was co by the hon. senator Molgat and the hon. Paul Cosgrove . 
after have the of many meetings in various regions of the country and have heard many of evidence , of conscious and of discussions , the committee is came to the conclusion and has fact report to the two Houses that the Senate should be elected by the people and he has some of the suggestions on the way of the there take . 
the report has been tabled in 1984 . 
as the know the honourable senators , nothing not has changed since this time . 
I recommends to the senators of read the report . 
you find that the committee not the is focused that on the question of know if the Senate should be set of people appointed or elected . 
the committee not had not to determine if the Canada should have a regime bicameral of government or to the deal on the powers and devoirs who incomberaient to a second House . 
, the over of the years , these questions have in great part been left for the . 
, my notice , this are of the questions cruciales which he would of first answer before of stop the method of selection of the people who would part of a such second House or of draw the number of senators according the region or the province . 
, this regard , I am out that the senator Joyal is in are of form a committee officieux of distinguished academic for study these questions . 
in reason of the efforts that he makes , the senator Joyal is described in the press as the Sir Galaad of the Senate . 
we we forward of know the results of this study and the recommendations who will can - be made . 
in ending , I you thank all for the assistance that you me you made in my business to the Senate to the over of the years . 
I thank all the employees and the officials for their kindness and their cooperation . 
I wish to thank all particularly my Secretary , Sallie DeLaplante , who is , to the gallery , for his loyalty , the support and the effectiveness during if long . 
well course , I thank my dear woman Grace , who me has constantly seconded to the over of this period . 
let - me of mention a last something . 
this not is not a question of privilege . 
he seems that he there that a farceur to the Senate . 
he not there has not if long , probably by regard for my age and my comfort , . has the a coverage under my office . 
I know who has fact that . 
the senator Nino Nino : 
this is probably Grace ! 
the senator Lewis : 
this is possible , but I will the let to the next occupying of this been . 
I you thank for your patience and you offer my best best for the future . 
of the Senators :

the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the government to the Senate we has given the insurance , which we accept , that the Alternative of the Sea King in view of the activities aéronavales is a great priority of the Minister of the Defence national . 
he there has two days , the Secretary Parliamentary of the Minister has said , in response to a question raised to the House of the Commons , that the decision it to the Minister and that she the people on the office . 
today today , the under - Leader of of - Staff of the Defence has said that the forces Armed have signed the statement of the need to the end of June or to the beginning of July . 
other said , the Minister is since already a good time . 
why is - he ? 
the is - . further of the intention stated in the book white of the Defence of 1994 , according which he the was then of a priority and that . there your of here the end of this decade ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
as the has out the senator , he seems that of the business préliminaires have been wishes to the about of this decision . 
when I combines that with the insurance that I I received of the Minister , to know that this decision represents his great priority , I I good hope that a decision will taken in a future very grown . 
the Alternative of the canoeing of helicopters Sea King - - possible of évacuer the troops of the sectors chauds 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , these warning encouraged come five years more later . 
the patient not the the not very well . 
the Minister is to the aware of the operation Cobra , who has had place he there has few years , where we we be on the Sea King , to the case where we would forced of évacuer of the troops of the Bosnia . 
someone 4 500 military of the Forces Canadian are now in mission in of the areas dangerous , in the world world . 
what kind of equipment utiliserions - we for évacuer these people and the to in place course , if we we do opposite to a such need today today ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the senator Forrestall knows that the officers senior are without no doubt always in legislation of express the need of equipment Supplementary , need who the fact always feel . 
we we of the equipment who is in operation since very long and the Minister of the Defence national the is given as priority of do replace this equipment the more quickly possible . 
in this who respect the helicopters Sea King , the hon. senator has said and continues of saying that the program of Alternative not advance not enough quickly . 
I not can speak of this who the is happened in the past , but I hope that we properly in legislation of replace this equipment in a deadline reasonable . 
honourable senators , I not am not a strategist military , but I know that he there has some types of aircraft who are very well to move of the staff and of the equipment to of the regions of the world where we are called to speak . 
he must hope that this ability which . the is served recently remains good . 
the senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I me concern of the well - be of the members of the Forces Canadian . 
they are in of the aircraft who , when they are utilisables , not can be used that during a brief period . 
the equipment is old and little definitive . 
still yesterday or before - yesterday , we we should évacuer a school to the Cape - Cape because that a of Hercules has éprouvé of the problems of drives and has should the question , by legislation of précaution to the better , but he the was probably of a atterrissage of emergency . 
we not know not that the Labrador are blanketed to the soil . 
we versons10 million of $ , for sit to the table and for know this who will the to . 
this is presumably for that we can replace the F - 18 . 
if . can spending 140 million of $ to left et147 million of $ to right , why not not seek to obtain of participate to the conception of the new Cormorant or Sikorsky for the ensure that they are pool of Mothballed imply to the requirements operational formula in the statement of the needs that we we established since that we we began to consider the Purchase of the EH - EH ? 
why not can - we not buy this new equipment and the use ? 
honourable senators , the people start to believe that the actions of the government are amoraux , they finiront soon by believe that they are immoraux . 
jumping before that of other people not long . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I sharing the concerns of the hon. senator , as all the other senators of , , in this who respect the security of our military and their effectiveness NDHQ . 
the equipment which we about is a equipment complex , and of the equipment complex care can into in caused . 
in effect , same the equipment complex nine falls sometimes in caused and has need of be ago . 
I think that he is fair of say that the program of Alternative is already in good seaway of too . 
the program of Alternative of the under - submarines considerable of a funding to up of more of three quarters of billion of $ . 
a helicopter for to replace the helicopter of research and of search Labrador costs close of 800 million of $ . 
these programs are in over . 
the Alternative of the canoeing of helicopters Sea King - Request of copy of the statement of the needs 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
the Minister the undertake he to table here , to the House , the statement of the needs to the regard of the program who is already chosen ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I will me information with of the Minister and I suivrai the practice usual for table the document . 
the industry 
the ligue national of hockey - - possible of a assistance government for the teams 
the hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
this week , the board City of Kanata has announced that he reduce of 75 per the taxes foncières of the Centre Corel . 
the amount and économisée would then been to the team of the Rangers of Ottawa . 
the government has he the intention of help the team of the Rangers to same the Board federal ? 
a such assistance will she split also between all the teams of hockey Canadian ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , Mr. Manley , the Minister responsible of the issues of this kind , has indicated that he Roles various options as to a some assistance federal . 
course , this more recent legislation was welcome in the process . 
. can say that she is encouraging in the context overall . 
however , the Minister Manley has indicated that , same the he the is of a not in the good direction , he will still several elements before that the government federal not take a decision . 
, this day , the Minister not has taken no decision to my knowledge . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , what are the major objections to the idea of help financially the teams of hockey professional ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
I not like not so the objections raised by the different stakeholders during the debates , honourable senators . 
they the are enough well views . 
however , I can assume that . the against to this idea to because of the salaries high of the protocol , without speak of the salaries of the owners of the teams . 
I not formula not these arguments . 
I émets only of the assumptions . 
by the through Mr. Manley , the government has clear said that he étudierait the question , but that all that assumed a enchaînement of events . 
the more recent , this is - to - say the decision of the board City of Kanata , is positive . 
however , all this that I can say to the honourable senators , this is that the Minister not is not still prepared to announce a decision . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , I am enough should . 
I not like not the grants what that they be . 
however , I I thought that the government federal would all the efforts imaginables for give of the money to the Rangers of Ottawa since give of the money to of the people who in than already many not is not of the all came for the Liberal federal . 
, as of example , the year last , the Corporation CBC - Canada has received 844 million of $ . 
the year before , she had received 903 million . 
if I not me read , the chairman and the chairman - chairman of this society touch between 200 $ and 300 $ $ by year . 
the houses of edition have received 31 643 742 $ the year last . 
the chairman and the steering of the board of Administration of the Rogers Cable touch more of 1 million of $ by year , but this not are not of the stars who the produced in brutes all the samedis last before two million of sideshow . 
the book Blue , the Estimates Main of the Estimates , contains many of other examples of the same acabit . 
of the grants there are for for the filmmakers and the networks of television . 
. give of the money for wasn of the films that human not will never see ; the é and the producers touch between 50 $ $ and 200 $ $ by Film , without speak of their remuneration Annual . 
Mr. . Manley believes - he a only moment that he not will not the teams and the protocol of hockey of the small communities of the Prairies and of the back - country of the Ontario ? 
the government should have shame . 
on the plan cultural , the hockey is many more important for the Canada that all these case which I I spoke . 
you invitations duties these cheques as tomorrow . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I me am of see that the senator has of the ideas also opinionated on the question . 
I not certainly not of in do share to who of right . 
I I thought a moment that the senator was on the point of by the principles NDP - Conservative who , in the of development economic , prefers give of the money to those who the lose rather that to those who know in gain . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
this is the philosophical Liberal ! 
the senator Boudreau : 
answers delayed to of the questions Oral

in Saskatchewan , to the end of October , 1 267 customers were in arrérages compared to 953 to the same date the year last , while that to the Manitoba , these figures were clauses of 243 and would . 
he must mention that he there has usually a lag before that the effects of a crisis on the market not the do feel on the levels of arrérages . 
the SCA continue therefore of follow the situation of close to the over of the next year . 
, this at - this , the better way of help the customers who indiscriminately of the difficulties is of work closely with them to of find of the solutions who their will of extension this crisis . 
in as that society of state federal , the SCA is prepared to play the role of tool of policy public that . him will .

the changes Regional to the CSRN undoubtedly also the producers to obtain of the funds : 
the below of intervention of the income minimum of the CSRN is past of 10 $ $ to 20 $ $ for a particular and of 20 $ $ to 35 $ $ for a family of farmers . 
the meeting to the CSRN can now do a withdrawal and a Tabled to the over of the same year . 
the period of would for the avances on withdrawal has been constitutes to a year ( she was of 90 days ) for the producers who have withdrawn a amount Superior to the to which they had right in under of the floors of intervention . 
the costs of too - paid for the avances on withdrawal have been down . 
the producers who the are retirés of the program CSRN will the there reinstate after two years rather that three as this is the case now . 
in reason of these changes , the Administration of the ACRA has paid close of 380 million of $ to someone 19 $ producers . 
of more , a little more of 27 500 producers have withdrawn 304 million of $ of their accountable CSRN . 
these changes indicate well the commitment of the government of the Canada to do evidence of creativity and of flexibility in concevant of the programs who help the producers who in have the more need , and his will of continue of to of the improvements to of ensure to this that the more great number of producers Canadian possible so benefit of the assistance available . 
the business of the Senate

that to also say that the reports of these two committees will made to the Senate . 
the honourable senators must be vigilant and ensure to this that , if a committee fact report before the other , the he is proposed of study a report before that the study of the two reports be on to the order of the day , that be said suggested . 
the senator Kinsella :

is - this that that the is never fact before ? 
the senator Hays : 
I thank the senator Corbin of his question . 
I am that we we indeed on the point of create a new precedent . 
I think well that our experts of the procedure me would out the existence of a such precedent . 
but they not in have nothing fact . 
I in conclude that this practice is new . 
the senator Corbin : 
honourable senators , I believe know that a committee will responsible of some aspects of this bill of bill . 
this committee is authorized to present a report , but this report not will not examined before that the bill of bill not be referred to the other committee , who will to the turn the report , and the two reports will debated in same time . 
pays - you me indication how the bill of bill will sent of a committee to the other , or who the in chargera , if this not is not by our through ? 
the senator Kinsella : 
the Clerk the in chargera . 
the senator Hays : 
the senator out that the bill of bill not can the find that to a only place to the time . 
he not is already more to the Senate . 
we the we referred to the committee of the Banking with education of we in do report . 
I I explained , and we in we spoke yesterday , that the bill of bill will then referred to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
he not will therefore not examined to more of a place to the time . 
he has already been submitted to the committee of the Banking . 
when this committee in will debated , the committee of the Affairs foreign the in assisting . 
the chairman of this committee souhaitera can - be the table in same time that the report of the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
I think that this way of proceed will . 
if no attempt not is made for debate the Prime report before that the other not we be referred , I not see not how this way of proceed could be judged suggested . 
I hope that this observation assistance the senator . 
the senator Corbin : 
honourable senators , he is here question of a precedent who could have a impact on the operating future of the Senate . 
a time that a precedent is established , . parliament to the point for repeat the procedure . 
not would - he not more simple for the Prime committee responsible of study the bill of bill of in do report to the Senate , who inscrirait then a second order to referred of the bill of bill to the other committee ? 
he me seems that this would the way solutions of proceed in the circumstances . 
and , the bill of bill not would not all simply the in Awaiting someone share . 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , I attention to the hon. senator that the precedent there already . 
we not the are not today today , since we the we fact yesterday . 
today today , we force only this who has been fact . 
if someone a to the ask , this is well , but , according my agreement with the Leader Deputy of the Opposition , I not am that ask , to of ensure the order , of clarify the the the of the business for that he reflects this who looking in the bleus who you have been has to all , to the place of the a who believe in the é of the Senate of the 24 November , who have been distributed as of usual . 
the senator Corbin : 
honourable senators , I respecterai the decision of the Senate , but I wish simply to do a implementation in Custody in saying that he not would not approach to a such way of proceed by whim . 
we should having carefully the procedure . 
he me seems that , according the precedent to having in this case , the Prime committee should study the bill of bill , in do report , then the Senate reopened a other motion to referred of the bill of bill to the second committee , who in would report , then the two reports would in same time the subject of a debate . 
I not like not many the way which we we decided of proceed . 
the senator Hays : 
I accept the criticism , honourable senators , if this is well this which he the is . 
I then ensure to the senators that I be to the future more prudent for this who is of find of new ways of do , of the bills of bill to the committee . 
the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
honourable senators , the Leader Deputy of the government has tried of clarify the situation this after - afternoon , but , in another , the senator Corbin has poses that we we now a problem , because this Prime committee is the by the Rules of present the report as that he will prepared . 
he not can not expect that the other committee that presented the report . 
I recommends that the committee , the report as that the - this will prepared , but that we orders for examine this report that the other committee that examined the bill of bill . 
we respecterions and the Rules .

the senator Hays :

order orders OF 
bill of bill of implementation in into of the Agreement on the Station spatiale international civil 
second Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
- honourable senators , I say all of first that I am delighted of take the speak to comments of the bill of bill C - 4 , who act the participation of the Canada to the too of the great bill scientific and technologique that is the creation of the Station spatiale international . 
I attention in way that this bill of bill not has has no controversy to the other place . 
let - me of quote all of first the words exaltantes that has what the father of the program spatial Canadian , John H . Chapman : 
, the over of the second century of the Confederation , this are the links tissés in the space who maintiendront in place the fabric of the society Canadian all as the move of Railway and the télégraphe have soudé the provinces Diaspora to the over of the century last . 
Mr. . Chapman has then added : 
the progress technological fully of the exploration spatiale the répercutent in the activities normal of our world . 
honourable senators , the bill of bill C - 4 with of the exploration spatiale in the interest of all the Canadians and of the humanity . 
the bill of bill C - 4 allows to the Canada of become a partner to share full in the more great business , the construction and the and of the Station spatiale international . 
he officialise our participation in as that nation . 
our investment in of the bills of science and of Technology spatiales such that the Station spatiale international , are that the scientific , engineers and amenable Canadian roles a Position important on the market international . 
that allows to our country of continue to help to the child scientific and to our understanding of the who all world . 
the Station spatiale international is a symbol of cooperation international and of the effort concerté of the major Nations industrial of the world among which found the Canada in as that partner key . 
in his version clear , the Argonauts couvrira a neatly equal to a ground of football and logera a team permanent international of seven members which of the astronautes Canadian spécialisés in the areas of the biotechnologie , of the mention , of the observation of the Newfoundland and of the telecommunications . 
honourable senators , the legislation legislative which we are before the on the enforcement of the obligations of the Canada to the as of the Agreement on the cooperation Current to the Station spatiale international civil and on the application of the provisions of the Code criminal Canadian to the Canadians to on of the Argonauts . 
the parties to the agreed the engage to establish a framework of cooperation international between they in view of the conception detailed , of the development , of the and and of the use , to of the for harshness , of a Argonauts international civil . 
the bill of bill to the study the the legislation Canadian in harmony with the obligations international négociées in the framework of the agreed and , this by , ' the firm resolution of the Canada of participate to this bill . not can more historic . 
the history of the participation of the Canada to the bill of Station spatiale international date of the year where the Prime astronaut Canadian , é Garneau , has travelled in the space . 
in 1984 , the chairman Reagan had guest of the friends and of the allies to the join to the States - United in view of the construction , of the and and of the use of a Argonauts spatiale in orbite around of the Newfoundland , and this , to of the for harshness . 
in March 1985 , the Canada accepta the invitation and avisa the NASA that the contribution of the Canada would represents on the concept of a system of maintenance Bethune . 
this system not is nothing of least that the generation next of the gave spatial Canadian , who will to increase the Argonauts spatiale and to the speak a time that she will in orbite . 
in 1988 , the Canada , the States - United , the Europe and the Japan établirent formally a partnership in banning a agreed regarding the Argonauts spatiale . 
this document states the great principles and the touchstone legal of the cooperation Current to the program of a Argonauts spatiale . 
after the strengthens of the Argonauts spatiale in 1993 , the partners have finally guest the Russia to the associate to this who would become a Argonauts spatiale really international . 
the 8 April 1997 , during of a conference of press with the chairman Clinton , the Prime Minister of the Canada has réaffirmé the participation of the Canada to the program international of Argonauts spatiale and announced that the Canada would the parenting agile specially . 
this télérobot , known under the behalf of with consul , is designed for operate with a new gave parenting and well to the operations of patchwork and to the upkeep its . 
after three years of negotiations , all the parties have signed the new agreed intergouvernemental on the Argonauts spatialele 29 January 1998 , by formally a associated of the Russia . 
this agreed for a period of two years for his ratification , who must therefore the do the 29 January of the year 2000 . 
the bill Bill C - 4 allows to the Canada of ratify this agreed international and of approve formally our commitment to the regard of this partnership . 
in the discussions international , he is always question of the many accomplishments of the Canada in the area spatial , including of the Canadarm . 
this who is more important , the success of the Canadarm has spent to the Canada the credibility necessary for the aventurer still more far and illustrious of new progress in the consul spatiale of forefront , : with the confidence of the country who have a program spatial . 
he assure to the as scientific of the Canada a access draft to the conditions of microgravité of the space and creates of new benefits technological for the country all world . 
today today , the Canada recueille the benefits of his participation to the bill in words of contracts for the industry spatiale Canadian and in words of comforting , the comforting of participate to the a of the more major prouesses of the history in the area of the " . 
the Canada the is to a performance equal to three or four time the value of the Investment initial and to the creation of many jobs in the area of the Technology of forefront . 
the participation of the Canada to the construction of the Argonauts spatiale has démarré under of excellent under . 
in December last , we we attended to the implementation in place of the gave spatial and of the system of vision artificielle Canadian to the for of the montage of the two first modules of the Argonauts , the module American " Unity " and the module Russian " Zarya " . 
in May last , this is with great pride that we we seen Ms Julie Hervieux become the first CIBC to increase to on of the two first modules of the Argonauts . 
the year next , Mr. é Garneau simultaneously his third mission in quality of member of the crew of the STS - 97 . 
this mission will essentially so to the has of the its solaires of the Station spatiale international and comportera two " in the space Mr. Garneau coordonnera . 
AprèsM. é Garneau , Mr. Chris Hadfield simultaneously his second mission . 
with all our fellow , we assisterons to the first exit of a Canadian in the space in the human Mr. Hadfield , who will for mission of dramatically the new gave consul of the Canada on the Station spatiale international . 
managed this apparatus in place , the Canada and all the other country of the world g with wear and pride how working the gave spatial Canadian and the new gave consul who future to the construction of the more great structure spatiale and of the more great laboratory of microgravité never them . 
as that this system of maintenance Bethune will Operational , through to the has of the with consul to the base of the gave spatial , the astronautes will Canada in orbite of the tasks complex in full effectiveness and in any security to from of the comfort relatif of the modules of the Argonauts spatiale . 
in of other words , if the Technology consul Canadian not had not existed , this Argonauts not would could be built or entretenue with the effectiveness and the strengths The . 
in March , the government of the Canada has " to the Agency spatiale Canadian a funding stable and Standing to the as of the program spatial of the Canada . 
this decision testimony of the commitment firm of the government to the regard of the promotion of the Science and of the technologies of forefront on which the support the economy World based on the know and the Canadians for stay to the before - Custody in the area . 
our investment in the Technology spatiale the day in the right over of our commitments in the of protection of the Environment , such that out in the Protocol of Montreal and the agreements of Kyoto . 
the Canada is the had of RADARSAT , the an satellite who has for to our country of take the first place to the world for this who is of the management of the Newfoundland to from of the space . 
today today , we produced RADARSAT for monitor the floods , as in the case of the flood of the saying Cross to the Manitoba , for support the operations of management of the disasters , as to Kobe , to the Japan , and for better do understand the effects of the War on the effect local and their Environment , as in the case of the Vietnam . 
our investment in the area spatial we allow of do current the découvertes scientific . 
through to the experience which by the scientific world of the space among which the Canadians are recognized for their role decisive , we told more on the who , on the effects of the sun on the Newfoundland and on the way of operating the conditions of microgravité unique , this who we allows of obtain of the information elevating on the system distress - Companion , the routine , the cerveau and the effects of the been on the body human . 
the experience Canadian in the area of the Science spatiales the penchent , by example , on the problems of health which the cancer and the diseases of the routine as the osteoporosis , a illness who one more of a million of Canadians . 
our Investment fact current the Innovation , who has of the benefits in our daily . 
of our days , we not seem not aware that , each time that we allumons the téléviseur , écoutons the forecasts of the time , which visit to the doctor , allumons our computer portable , take our telephone of voiture or enfilons our shoes of , who absorbent the chocs , we produced of the products and services who have bénéficié of the research spatiale . 
our investment exceptions also the industry spatiale , who employ of the thousands of Canadians and has of the income of more de1,4 billion of $ , which 45 per people of the exports , this who is the percentage the more high among the country who have a industry spatiale . 
through to the strategy industrial of the Canada , who has fact of the consul spatiale and of the Lightstations a agree strategic , our industry has happened of the technologies innovative who are their in in the world world . 
of other country industrialized of Prime plan are call to the expertise of the Canada for do of their contribution to the Argonauts spatiale a reality . 
EMS Technologies , of Ottawa , has recently result a market of due million of $ home Mitsubishi , to the Japan , for provide the component Ministerial of the contribution Japan to the Station spatiale international . 
of other commandes could to the value total of the market to 24 million of $ . 
by - that all , our commitment to the regard of a sector spatial dynamic is a commitment to our young , our future scientific , engineers and astronautes . 
in way of conclusion , I say that the Station spatiale international will to do current the telecommunications , the Science and the Innovation , the observation of the Newfoundland and the exploration spatiale . 
the ratification of the bill Bill C - 4 is a step important in this who is a commitment international sustainable and beneficial of the Canada . 
the bill of bill , who act the participation Canadian to this business remarkable , is a not that we franchissons with confidence , to the time where the Canada and the humanity the apprêtent to do a show of géant . 
( on the motion of the senator DeWare , to the behalf of the senator Kelly , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the speech of the Throne 
the Adresse in response - Motion an end to the debate the eighteenth day of sitting - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Hays , seconded by the hon. senator MLA : 
that the deliberations to the order of the day for the resuming of the debate on the motion Honourable to the Adopted of a Adresse in response to the speech of the Throne , given by His Excellency the Gouverneure general before the two Houses of the Parliament , the remission the eighteenth day of sitting where the order will been debated ; 
and on the motion of amendment of the hon. senator Kinsella , seconded by the hon. senator DeWare , that the motion not be not now agreed but that she be amended in deleting the word " eighteenth " and in the replacement by the word " fourteenth " . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I like you remind that I I proposed , as several leaders assistants of the government of the two parties before me , that the interventions in response to the speech of the Throne the remission the eighteenth day of sitting where the order will been debated . 
other said , the deliberations would completed in eight days of sitting . 
the key objection of the senator Kinsella is that this motion tortuous unduly the number of senators given to speak on this motion . 
in fact , he is went until to say that that could be dangerous . 
I me see therefore in the obligation of try of him explain the reasons of this motion . 
honourable senators , we we had five days of deliberations , with in average , of the interventions of three senators by sitting , this who fact a total of 15 senators to have taken the speak , nine of the Opposition and six government . 
well that we not we not subject by the rule next , he is however interesting of learn that the ) 50 ( 1 ) of the Rules of the House of the Commons states : : 
the deliberations on the Order of the day to resuming of the debate on the motion of Adresse in response to the speech of the Throne and on all the amendments there proposed not must not overtake six days of sitting . 
honourable senators , this is two days of least that this that I move in my motion . 
well heard , the other place has of the rules similar regarding , by example , the debate budget . 
how explain this rule of the other place , and why this motion would - she a tradition here ? 
that the ask , to my sense , by the fact that the response to the speech of the Throne has always been for the senators the opportunity of to virtually not any what about , and not not only , as the has left hear the senator Kinselladans the intervention , the plan of action proposed by legouvernement - well that this be desirable . 
in of other words , a senator can ask to take the speak for deal of not any what question , without that his colleagues not in have been charges to the pre , and to which they could wish answer . 
he there however to the Senate a way for do this kind of speech and this is the notice of motion or the notice of inquiry . 
after a notice of a day , necessary in the two case , the speech is given . 
honourable senators , is the way appropriate of raise of the questions in this House . 
nothing not we from of proceed and . 
the notice of a day is required for a good reason . 
if the speech of the Throne rest recorded to the Paper during too long , . risk of use this clause of the order of the day to of other for that the for for . 
the senator Kinsella concluded , in the screening of figures , that the time Allocation to the debate on the speech of the Throne not is not sufficient . 
I not want not me moquer of him , but to the page doubling of the é of the Senate , he concluded : 
, the pace of two p.m. by day , ... ... ... that would a total of 16 p.m. . 
according this scenario , seulement32 senators could comment this who must be , of the point of view of the government , the great bill overall of the session . 
least of the third of the members of the Senate could therefore participate to the debate ... 
honourable senators , let - me of correct the figures of the senator Kinsella . 
if each senator can speak pendant15 minutes and if we can spend two p.m. by day to the discussion , then eight senators could each day speak of the Adresse to His Excellency . 
by therefore , if we autorisions 16 p.m. of debate - eight days expanded by two p.m. by day - 64 senators could take the speak , be two time more that the number up by the senator Kinsella and about the two third of the senators in this House . 
. not can not say that this be unreasonable . 
according the proposition of the senator Kinsella , be two p.m. by day during 14 days , this proposal would à112 senators of take the speak . 
, my notice , this is that many more of time that the debate not in ask . 
the senator Carstairs : 
this is more of senators that he there in has to the total ! 
the senator Hays : 
in fact , since 1967 , the number way of senators to spoke of the speech of the Throne the figure very exactly to 20,73 . 
by therefore , little any the way of neat , the motion guarantees that all the senators who the wish will normally participate to the debate . 
of more , and that intéressera my colleagues of the other side , the precedents seem look in favour of 8 days and nonde 14 . 
the comment 271.1 of Beauchesne there : : 
after that the government has proposed and seconded the motion of Adresse in response to the speech of the Throne , the House has of eight days of sitting to the safeguarded for complements the debate on the motion . 
honourable senators , this is exactly the same comment mentioned in the rules in the other place . 
in our House , honourable senators , this was the use one by many , there including by my predecessor , the hon. senator Graham . 
the 2 October 1986 , the Conservatives , by the through of the senator Doody , have fact approve a motion identical by the Senate . 
then , of new , the 13 December 1988 , the senators have given their approval to again occasions to this motion who has been accepted to the unanimously when she has been introduced by the senator Frith , in 1983 . 
in summary , honourable senators , the amendment not is not valid to my notice , not so because that the calculus are erronés , but particularly because that he will to the any of all the precedents and because that he draw unnecessarily the debate on a about , then that the time Allocation enough ample . 
the figures are enough éloquents .

the triumphs , the link beyond between the say and the of , has émergé as the - of one of the history . 
the logical , of Locke to Bosanquet , has the the say to the when . 
the logiciens not have however not succeeded to understand the spirit poétique . 
also the poetry has she émergé indemne to the long of the unwelcome , enveloppée of mystery between history and science , between so and truth , as the more may annonciatrice of the literature and of the culture . 
the great criticism Owen Barfield has a day wrote : " - point of touch the more obvious between the sense and the poetry is the triumphs . " 
the triumphs , posing Shelley , has délimité the area flou between the words and the of . 
the say was the poetry before the prose . 
and this is and that fact " the debate on this that please the poetry and the history . 
the history is - she truth , or the truth the which she better in the recount or the austérité of the poetry ? 
spend criticized to the era common , to our cybermonde , of the books to the claviers of computer . 
the rise quick of the media electronic , who will now soon exceeded by Internet , has forced some pseudo - criticism to support , for thrust a false clameur , that the age of the literature , and therefore the age of the poetry and of the prose , one to his end . 
for so Mark Twain , the announcement of the death of the literature is rather premature . 
. can support with more of into that to the age hamstrung , the importance of the literature , the secession of the poetry , among now still more important that before for a society civil . 
the poetry contains the history popular and the memory popular as the history only not can succeed to the do . 
how we memories - we the facts historic ? 
, the over of the period unto of David , he there had the psaumes . 
in the war of the Péloponnèse , he there had the Iliade . 
in the first era Christian , he there had the Sermon on the montagne . 
in the Prime Commonwealth British , he there had the sad poetry of Milton . 
the First War World , who is illustrée in the chamber who we around , not is - she not évoquée to said in the Smart At face of honour ? 
before the arrived of the Europeans to the Canada , the mythes poétiques of the Peoples aboriginal abondaient in our country . 
same Jacques Cartier was poet . 
as that he has accosté on the land who the appellerait the Canada , our country is became rich in poètes and in poetry . 
more of 1 500 poètes have been published to the Canada . 
we we had the happy of welcome to the Senate the late Jean LeMoyne , who we has the visit in as that poet of forerunners . 
. me said that the Canada the the more great number of poètes published by capita in the world . 
all the country , great and grandchildren , are a regain of life through to the words of their poètes . 
we we a nice pléiade méconnue of poètes : of Atwood to Callahan , to Klein and to Cohen , of Johnson to Pratt , to Birney and to Scott . 
Louis Riel was a poet which the his have been published . 
in French , of LaPointe to Miron , to Legault , to Henault and to Roy , a rich treasury of poetry and of imagination creative continues of ambiguously . 
, the that of the next millennium , honourable senators , not appropriate - he not of redéfinir the role of the poet to the Canada ? 
since the 16 century , the poet official of the Court is considered as a part vital and Canada of the life of the Anglais . 
, the end of the years 30 , the Library of Congress , to Washington , has resumed the idea and the is associated a " poet - board " . 
with this simple bill , we could celebrate the his of the poètes and occurrences the poètes , the Parliament and the people in a great harmony creative . 
the approach the in this bill of bill is simple and effective in words of cost : 
the Speaker of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of the Commons , Futures of together , being the poet official of the Parliament to from of a list confidentielle of three names Before by a committee chaired by the bibliothécaire Parliamentary and composed by , of the as General of the Library national , of the archiviste national of the Canada , of the Commissioner to the languages official of the Canada and of the chairman of the Council of the Arts of the Canada . 
the duties of the poet official are minimalistes , and this is wanted . 
, the over of the mandate of two years , the poet official of the Parliament : 
has ) cheques of the 9uvres of poetry , including to the for of the ceremonies official of the Parliament ;

the Sergeant socialist Prince has been the military aboriginal the more affirms of the two war global . 
he has served in fact to the over of the War War World . 
yet , when the Sergeant Prince and business home him , during 15 years , he not has could vote in the framework of the election federal or provincial . 
I I always thought that the better legislation never taken by the very hon. John Diefenbaker , and the government , has been of give to the aboriginal of the country the right of vote to the election federal . 
when I what before this school , I think to the situation of the aboriginal . 
in effect , because that I I up to Halifax , I I had very little of contacts with the aboriginal . 
I the praising sometimes when they were in city , to the spring , sell of the choirs of May , the fleur emblématique of the province . 
they frappaient sometimes to the the and we their achetions always of the choirs . 
this was my only touch with the aboriginal in my province . 
the aboriginal not make not a part important of the people of the Nova - Nova . 
by against , their contribution is certainly important . 
however , when I I déménagé in Alberta in 1965 , I me am was in a class of daughters to leSt. Mary s Girls High School , with of the young women of this that . was to the time the Scarcee Reserve , who was stretch to the limit of the city . 
this was the only school of studies high where she had the right of go . 
these daughters were always guarding to the gap of all the other daughters of the class . 
they participaient rarely to the discussions of the class and abandonnaient very quickly the studies . 
very little of between they 578 the 10e year , and I not me recall not that a only of between they be arrived in 11e year . 
honourable senators , I like power say that the situation has substantially changed since 1965 , but the truth is that she not has not many changed for the aboriginal of the country . 
in effect , when I enseignais to Winnipeg in 1981 , I me remind of a young man in the over of geography of 10e year who the is rose and has said of way injurieuse this that he quite of the aboriginal . 
he me has multitude completely stupéfaite . 
I me wish stand in the class , in as that professor , and écoutais a star of 15 years speak of other human , of his fellow of the province of the Manitoba , in débitant of the lies and of the things inaccurate that he not could have learned that of the mouth of his parents , of his colleagues or of his fellow . 
after me be been of the had initial and have began to do of the comments on some of his comments , I I found that he was do a unity of this over on the life of the aboriginal to the Canada and I me am implementation to the thing . 
I am not be never came to across of the prejudice of this young man . 
I was fascinée by the fact that he not was not unborn to the Canada . 
this was a 1915 . 
he was came to the Canada to the age of two or three years . 
his parents were educated , well éduqués . 
the father was professor of mathématiques ; his mother enseignait to the Faculty of his dental . 
this was of the people educated . 
yet , this star had a opinion so racist on our aboriginal that this was troubling . 
I i therefore that I not would not should be if vehemence when I I been convoquée to the school of my daughter Catherine when she was in 6e year . 
by the of a bad experience that she had his in 5e year , we had decided of the send in a other school . 
impossible in a new community , Cathi not said not great - something , this is - to - say until to the day where he there has had a discussion in his class on the aboriginal . 
the students have fact of the comments negative . 
new in this class , Cathi , to the great pride of his mother , has sudden said that the students not knew not well of what he was question . 
she has reminded the fact that I was retournée to the education after his birth and that I had committed a Crie of the North of the Alberta as gouvernante . 
this that Cathi knew of the aboriginal , she the had learned of Theresa . 
the - this him had unequal this that he there had of better in his community . 
honourable senators , little after have been elected to the Assembly legislative of the Manitoba , I am for visit the school of the a The grew . 
an Lathlin , who was then Leader and is now Minister to the within of the government of the Manitoba , had transféré the students of the Division school of Kelsey to The grew for that they so be éduqués in the school of the contingency . 
he believed that they not Ouje not in their school the experience cultural that they were live , that this school not could not answer to their needs and he wanted that they headed home them , in their community . 
Mr. . Lathlin me had delve to visit the school . 
I must say that this that I there I seen was enough remarkable . 
in 1965 , the students the ennuyaient , but in this school aboriginal where . enseignait the customs and the language aboriginal in more of the rest of the program school of the province , the students were pétillants and débordaient of enthusiasm . 
this was remarkable . 
the students aboriginal have of , won the majority of the price to the exposure scientific of the North of the Manitoba . 
this was a event remarkable . 
honourable senators , I I seen the same phenomenon when I I visited the school For of the Earth to Winnipeg . 
this is can - be for that that I am a if ardente partisan of the self government for the aboriginal . 
I wish to this principle because that I am outset that the aboriginal not will never do the progress that they should do as that they not the administreront not them - same , and we we the responsibility of do in so that they parviennent to this self government . 
honourable senators , this is a secret of polichinelle to the Senate - and I know that number of between you are well the Affairs aboriginal - that he there has - least of aboriginal that of not - aboriginal in the institutions of education post . 
certainly , of the progress have been made . 
he there has now more of aboriginal who are doctors , lawyers and dentists . 
we we same the opportunity of be among we , in this room , not least of five senators aboriginal who Whelans all a important contribution to our institution . 
but this is dangerously . 
of other statistics 18.7 that the Peoples aboriginal this the rate of death the more high to the Canada , as to the birth , this who is tragic , that home the young . 
these Late are account to of the accidents , to of the fire and - this who is the worse tragedy of all - to of the suicides , the young aboriginal showing the rate of suicide the more high home the young to the Canada . 
by , , no of between you not the surprendra of learn that , home the aboriginal , the diabetes is endémique . 
a doctor has same comparé this illness to the small vérole or to the rougeole , that we we made with we in as that immigrants counterparts on this mainland and who have in the death of a number record of victims . 
now , they long prematurely to because of the diabetes instable . 
we know that the diabetes can the control by a diète . 
. not affecte not enough of resources to the fight against the diabetes for that this illness not kills more the aboriginal to the Canada . 
no of between you not the surprendra not more of know that the aboriginal have still the rate of unemployment the more high . 
he not is not came that 90 per of the aboriginal resource to the work be to the unemployment . 
he not is not came in the North of the Manitoba that the children have of the marshalling with the justice because that , frankly , these children consider that he worth better live to the centre of detention youth of Winnipeg that in their own community aboriginal . 
honourable senators , when the senator Gill has spoke of his objectives and of his aspirations , I not I could me prevent of think that we educated all enormous of his presence to the Senate . 
we in educated all because that he we he constantly , to the like of the senators Watt , Chalifoux and Adams , the questions to of the effects on the aboriginal . 
the aboriginal have the right of be treated as of the citizens to share full of this country . 
this is therefore say that he must their give the same opportunities that to all the other Canadians of benefit of care of health , of a education and of a government of quality . 
we we now since a sure number of years a response if to the report of the Board Royal on the Peoples aboriginal . 
we not we not received of response if . 
I please each of between you of from of the government to the power that he provide the more quickly possible a response if . 
honourable senators , to the over of the last weeks , I I followed with interest the visit of the members in the province of British - British in the framework of their study and of their assessment of the treaty nisga' has . 
the racism for who , to my notice , is unfortunately always present in our society the is concern . 
, my great regret , he is acquiescence by a party policy that I consider détritivore . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the senator Carstairs : 
I give to my colleagues aboriginal the insurance that I the support and that I the encourage in the any of their fight to to do of the members of their people of enemies citizens Canadian . 
the senator Kinsella : 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , the speech of the senator Carstairs is united . 
he the can that we we in are of create of more great problems for the future . 
I am sensitive to the question on which he the is given . 
a other something me agace in the speech of the senator Carstairs . 
the report of the commission Royal wended of the comments probantes regarding the Late of children , the problems révoltants in the area of the education and the problems of order developmentally and parent quasi sterilize to deal . 
why the government not has he not still responded with into before these problems ? 
is - this only a question of money or must - he there see other something ? 
the senator Carstairs : 
senator Grafstein , I not think not that this be only a question of money . 
I believe that he there has that a lack of will policy . 
this lack of will policy will perdurer because that he not there has not enough of Canadians not aboriginal of all the broaden who the are montrés loans to defend the because of our Peoples aboriginal . 
the senator Grafstein : 
the hon. senator Chalifoux is here . 
she and me we we are by on the matter of the without - homeless of Toronto . 
she has sought also actively that me to convince the government of the deal to the problem of the without - homeless . 
we are enchantés that . that responsible a Minister of coordinating this effort . 
she has fact a magnificent work in all the country . 
of more , we hope , in the sillage of the speech of the Throne , power convince the cabinet of act quickly and assiduously . 
such are our expectations . 
that the said , in struck the matter of the without - homeless of Toronto , I me am heurté to a very puzzling problem . 
in under of the Constitution of the Canada - I not know not if this is the clause 95 or 92 - , this is of the government that matters the Indian and the Lands Indian . 
however , I I been surprised of see that , notwithstanding the Constitution , the departments not assumaient not their obligations Constitutional to the regard of the Indian who live to the outside of the reserves . 
of where the seriously problem which we are face to Toronto , that where a great majority of the without - homeless are of the aboriginal who live outside of the reserves , to the outside of the Lands Indian . 
however , the government not has no responded opposite to this deficiency in this who respect the obligation made by the Constitution . 
then , who is responsible ? 
I ask to the senator , who just of do a very course speech , if she has exploré this deficiency in the of responsibility and if we , of this House , can do someone something for which to this irresponsabilité constitutional . 
the senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I like say to the hon. senator that this problem constitutional not the is asked that in the case of the without - homeless , but that I me am battue in my riding for a question similar who respect the care of health for the children aboriginal . 
when a child is rodents of a community aboriginal and transféré in a service for children of a centre of the Science of the health , all the care easier to this child are to the for of the government federal because that he the is of a child living in a community aboriginal who provincial therefore of the responsibility federal . 
however , for of the reasons that I not understand not , the province of the Manitoba , is responsible of the services of care to home . 
by the of a dispute of jurisdiction between the Minister provincial of the Health and the counterpart federal , these children aboriginal remain often to the Hospital because that , a time that they expanding in their community , no service of care not their is assured . 
the taxpayers Canadian pay therefore more for that these children be soignés to the Hospital . 
this who is more important , these children are planners of their family and of their community and not can not maximiser their opportunity of guérison in the with of the people who the unhappy and the in roles the better . 
I would well wanted have a solution to propose to the senator . 
all this that I then him say is that we must to many of other debates as the this by the senator Gill , in will that the other place the there interest . 
the hon. Sheila Finestone : 
honourable senators , this Exchange and the interesting statement of the senator Carstairs me have fact think to the bill of bill C - 31 , that I I had the déplaisir of shepherding to the House of the Commons to the beginning of the years 80 . 
, the time , we dimensions the question of the rights of the women valour in tribe . 
, the end , he the was of to end to a aberration by which a aboriginal who he for woman a not - aboriginal could i to his children the rights learning to his birth and other rights which he could the an , then that if the sister of this man had to by a not - aboriginal , she weakening all his rights tribal , all his rights to the land and that the right of live in the contingency . 
she not could nothing i of the heritage ancestral to his butchered of second or of third generation . 
this bill of bill was allow to the women of go on the Lands réservées to the aboriginal , their territory ancestral , and of fact of all the rights and privileges accorded to their brothers , maternal and Fathers . 
unfortunately , he not there has not been provided enough of funds for fund the construction of houses or of schools for allow to the children and to the families in this situation of the integrate fully in their companies respective . 
he is unfortunate that we not we not built the kind of facilities who could answer to the needs of these families in the of housing or provide of the schools for receive these children , this who has led to a dysfonctionnement social to the place of facilitate the life of these women and of their family . 
her the senator could - she we propose a way whatever who we would to we , to the Senate , and to our colleagues aboriginal of exercise a some pressure on the other place , for respect the commitments , constitutional or not , who are of the values fundamental in the society Canadian for that we can all be gathered in a only people ? 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
honourable senators , the period the for this debate is completed . 
you pleasure - he of the extend for allow to her the senator Carstairs of answer ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , the senator Finestone has specifically asked this that our House could do . 
I believe that we we two choice . 
all of first , we can have point to the committee Senate Standing of the Peoples aboriginal . 
this is the committee who is responsible of study , and who has examined this kind of question . 
however , he so sometimes that he be necessary of own a little our committees . 
I believe that this that the committee apprécierait without doubt , and this was the case by the past , this would the Tabled of a motion to the Senate his our desire of see the committee of the Peoples aboriginal about a some study . 
the senator Finestone : 
that this motion be proposed .

the officer responsible to Ottawa has advised the responsible to Halifax of let these candidates the present to the review , adding that they not the down can - be not . 
he seems indeed that they not the have not succeeded because that or the a or the other of these two men not has never brought the tunique Red . 
this is a good indication of this who the was to the time .

the transport 
v. of the operations of the company air Inter - Canadian 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
I am course that the Minister , who just also of the Canada Atlantic , has taken note of the fact that the a of the carriers Threat of our region not is more in operation these days - this . 
that has a impact direct not only on the Airports of the region , but also on a important reach of the workers . 
w ( 1420 ) 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , unfortunately , I not I not had the opportunity of read or of hear the statement made by the chairman of Inter - Canadian . 
I believe understand that Inter - Canadian continues of have of the talks with his major partners , this is - to - say his employees , NAV CANADA , Canadian and of other Income . 
the purpose is of solve some problems and of ensure the any of the services . 
. me said also that the service Air is used to all the destinations expressed by Inter - Canadian to share three places where of other solutions are available . 
that shows well the period of uncertainty in which is - the sector of the transportation Air . 
that the still more the focus on the principles out by the Minister of the Transport to the House of the Commons and publicly . 
I will repeat these principles here for the stewardship of the honourable senators . 
the statement of principles émise by the Minister énumérait clear the five objectives of the policy public of the government , this is - to - say the protection of the consumers against the price inordinate ; the keeping of the services to the small communities , this who concern particularly the hon. senator ; the protection of the rights and the concerns of the employees ; the keeping of the competition in the legislation of the possible ; the control Canadian in the facts . 
these objectives two those of the government . 
the v. of the operations of Inter - Canadian - - possible of a review by the committee of the transport and of the Communications 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the Minister of his response . 
I note that he has resumed in his response the statement in which the Minister of the Transport has statement these five principles for the first time to St. John , to the New - Brunswick , to the end of the been or to the beginning of the fall . 
the Minister of the Transport has repeatedly these principles when he has before before the committee Senate Standing of the transport and of the Communications and when he has appeared before the committee Standing of the transport of the House of Commons . 
that seems be the - cornerstone of the response of the government to the problem of Inter - Canadian , who is well real . 
the 13 August , then that the problem not was that appréhendé , the government has invoqué the power extraordinary provided to the clause 47 of the Act on the transport . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I acknowledge the concern implicit in the question of the hon. senator . 
however , he should rather address his question to the chairman of the committee . 
I not like not spokesmen the authority of the committee in the the . 
the senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , I wanted address my question to the chairman of the committee . 
in effect , by courtesy , I I tried of the join , but . me has said that she not would not in city of any the week . 
the Canada Atlantic and of other places of the is of the Canada are a interruption of the services Threat regional . 
this is a fact . 
this not is not a situation abstraite that appréhendait the government when he has invoqué the clause 47 . 
the ascertain has been referred to the committee . 
I I attended to some of the meetings of the committee when he has examined the five principles out by the Minister . 
the - this not think he not that some measures should be taken to that our committee of the transport can the meet this week ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I know that the Minister is very aware of the situation . 
in fact , he continues of the follow of close . 
we think that he not there will no perturbation important of the Liaison with the communities expressed by Inter - Canadian . 
, some places , unfortunately , the interruption of the service by Inter - Canadian not will no impact real , as this is the case to Sydney where all service had already been withdrawn before this day . 
the question of the hon. senator is important . 
the Minister continues of monitor the situation . 
I bring certainly the concerns of the hon. senator to the Minister and , to the first opportunity , to the chairman of the committee . 
I me sense very difficulty to the comfortable of say that a committee Senate should the meet other that by the of the decision of the committee and of his chairman . 
the v. of the operations of the company air Inter - Canadian - - possible of a assistance government 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
my question has relates to the situation of the society Inter - Canadian , the transporteur regional independent the more important to the Canada . 
as the senator Kinsella the has said , this transporteur Air regional connection the people of the region of the Atlantic . 
since three days , however , of the hundreds and of the hundreds of travellers have seen their bills seriously disrupts by the interruption of the services and the keeping to the soil of the had of this company . 
this last saying she - same work to a plan of survival . 
given given that his survival depends including of the granting immediate of a assistance of 15 million of $ , that is - this that the government of the Canada is prepared to do for the help to answer now to his needs financial pressants ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the government of the Canada is prepared to do in so that no centre not be left without service . 
as that I far , he not there has not for the time of centre where he not there not of service of alternative . 
the Minister has said that he would follow the situation . 
he is surely in communication with the responsible of Inter - Canadian . 
this that he is prudent of do for the time , of the notice of the government , this is of continue to monitor the situation and ensure to this that a service of alternative be available . 
the senator Oliver : 
honourable senators , the hon. Minister has said that as that he far , he not there has no centre in the region of the Atlantic who be without service . 
however , the services have been seriously disrupts . 
many of people have seen their bills of trip retardés and have been incommodés because that the service has been interrompu and that the had have been blanketed to the soil . 
in his response to the senator Kinsella , the Leader of the government has said that he there had of other opportunities . 
this not is certainly not a solution permanent . 
the Minister would - he the please of we say what legislation permanent the government will for that Inter - Canadian reprenne his prohibit soon , with a plan Standing ? 
by the past , the government has helped , financially and other , the Airlines air Canadian . 
that will he do for a transporteur who connection the region of the Atlantic ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
this is the question the more important who concern the Minister of the Transport and the government . 
the solution permanent must to the of the objectives of policy that I I out he there has little of time . 
the solution permanent will she a place to Inter - Canadian or to a other transporteur , we not can the say for the moment . 
in pending , we must ensure to this that the communities not be not private of services . 
as that I far , they have of the services in this time . 
he there has a solution of alternative in all the communities .

Élections Canada 
the Manitoba - - loss of data negotiates 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , according the Globe and Mail of today today , the life privacy de675 $ thinks - be all the semiconductors of the province - has been abusing to the months of January when a official of Élections Canada has lost a a enclosing of the information confidentiels . 
he the was of the behalf of semiconductors , of their question , of their date of birth , of their pardon and of their for of driver . 
these information personal are useful to the businesses legitimate as to the activities criminal . 
. we said that the a would presumably in a place of enfouissement and that Élections Canada would taken of the measures for that situation incident not the occurring more . 
he is clear also that a principle basic relatif to the protection of the information personal has been breached , to know the principle of the consent . 
the data allow for a reason given not should never be used to a other end without the consent of the human concernée . 
some thinks not have not had the opportunity of give their consent to the a or the other level of government . 
I I two questions to question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
of first , the government the excusera he of this unfortunate incident with of the people manitobaine ? 
then , the government abandonnera he the attitude cavalière and adhérera he to the principle basic of the consent - as in this who respect the information who him are releases by of other governments that in this who respect those that he their question ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the incident which about the senator is really unfortunate and not of the all about . 
the a who has been many wended of the information personal from of the Division of the semiconductors and of the for of driver of the Manitoba . 
this a is came in the possession of Élections Canada , who has recognized that she has been deplore in a bac to PCB and that she not has not been recouvrée . 
this a wended of the information as the behalf , the question , the date of birth , the pardon and the number of for of driver and of plaque of outdated of thinks . 
Élections Canada has tenure the full responsibility of the loss and this is without hesitation that to the behalf of the government , I , my apologize to all the people affected . 
all of the after the incident , Élections Canada in has informed the authorities provincial , who him had sent the a . 
a inquiry has been implied on - the - face . 
Élections Canada has then fact call to a Auditor of the outside for to in magazine his process of security , then the in implement the changes reflected by the Auditor . 
this incident is certainly regrettable , but he is to hope that he not the happen not . 
the transfer of the data personal - - principle of the consent 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , I me am of this that the hon. Leader that presented of the apologize . 
this may will of the more furniture . 
I know however if I I received a response complete in this who respect the principle of the consent . 
if the Leader not can not provide the response on - the - face , I him cannot grateful of me to a response regarding on the policy of the government regarding this principle very basic . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I not am not all to fact sure of well before the nature of the question supplementary . 
the hon. senator would - she of forward to new his concern ? 
the senator Spivak : 
I believe that the data who are allow in a purpose not should not be used to a other end without the consent of the human interested . 
he there has a enormous amount of information , as we the we learned , , who are sent to the government and to of other agencies . 
and , of the businesses vendent of the understaffed of customers without the consent of the these . 
that the the allure of a problem in itself . 
I believe understand that this incident is of nature accidentelle . 
that not example not least the need of clarify this that I consider as a principle extremely important . 
the senator Boudreau : 
I thank the hon. senator of his implementation to the point . 
I understand the argument .

honourable senators , during of the review to the Senate of the Act election to the Canada , some of between we had of the reserves regarding these same provisions , to know , in what legislation the information personal would - they protected and the procedures implemented in place would - they or not expertise ? 
the government of the Canada and Élections Canada we have amorphous that this kind of things not could not the produce . 
I am vehemence that the Leader and Élections Canada say now that Élections Canada is in are of to in place of the procedures for prevent that these incidents not the occur . 
must - he in déduire that he not there had until to now no procedure or no system of control in place since the Adopted of the Act election ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I not like not that my hon. colleague in is a such conclusion . 
however , of the recommendations have been made to that of the measures further be taken and colleague . 
a number considerable of information are sent to Élections Canada and , fortunately , the kind of incident which we about today today is rare . 
in fact , the he has attention our attention , this is s because that that the happened very rarely . 
these provisions have been renforcées , . - in amorphous . 
what that be the provisions taken , I not broaden not until to say that he not risk not in the future that the information be unwitting released . 
. me assure however that these provisions are in seaway of be renforcées and that situation incident not is more a of the apply . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , by the of this very serious offence , not appropriate - he not of to in place a committee of monitoring , or a group of resolute , who veillerait to this that that not the occurring more ? 
these assurance we have already been data in the past , and he seems that the . that today today fact call to the Technology new for transfer these issues of manner rather entailed . 
my confidence is ébranlée because , on the plan legislative , particularly in the of protection of the life privacy , we take virtually all that the system works and we we coopéré in this sense . 
the time not is - he not help to a review independent for we ensure that the procedures ensured are indeed in place ?

he should exercise a some pressure for deal the question .

the SCRS slow now a inquiry of security Economy , and the Inspecteur General , who provincial of the Solicitor General , fact also inquiry .

the steering of the SCRS has guaranteed that all the measures necessary are taken for ensure the required respect of the political determined in the of security . 
still a time , he must let the CSARS and the Inspecteur General of the SCRS continue their reviews independent .

the committees parliamentarians can invite all the witnesses that they our appropriate .

the case of the MMT not has not created of precedent for the response of the government in any other case fully of the chapter 11 of the NAFTA . 
each case is considered individually , according the well - based . 
the group Special established to the words of the Agreement on the trade within ( ACI ) has presented the report before that the other hardship court not in come to this step . 
the group has concluded that the legislation regarding the MMT to the level of the trade interprovincial was contrary to the objectives of the agreed . 
for conform the bill to the decision of the group Special of the ACI , the Canada has withdrawn the MMT of the list of the products chemical Treaty by the shut regarding the trade interprovincial and the importation . 
that has also for to the Canada of deal to the secrecy with Ethyl Corporation . 
the case of the MMT in the framework of the NAFTA not is not for beyond - beyond of the arguments debates to the jurisdiction , and no sentence final not has been made . 
the society Sun Belt WaterInc. ( Sun Belt ) , of California , has presented the year last a " Notification of the intention of put a administer to the arbitrage " , in Conformity with the provisions of the chapter 11 of the NAFTA regarding the regulation of the differences between a prohibited and a state . 
by two time , and all recently in November 99 , Sun Belt has sought to an the procedure of arbitrage in means a Notice of arbitrage to the Canada . 
however , the two documents in question not failed not to the requirements procédurales of the chapter 11 of the NAFTA , and the Canada has , in consequential , informed Sun Belt that , to the notice , no procedure of arbitrage to the words duchapitre 11 not had been enclenchée . 
our Position is that no procedure of arbitrage to the words of the chapter 11 not can begin before that Sun Belt not that presented a Notice of arbitrage unfortunate . 
in the documents made to this day , Sun Belt claims that the British - British has taken , between 1989 and now , various " measures " contrary to the provisions of the chapter 11 of the NAFTA , there including the Building , in 1989 , of for of export of water in vrac , and the conduct of the prosecutor General to the regard of the action in justice to be of January 1993 . - allegations of offences took by the Canada to the regard of the NAFTA improve the sections 1102 ( Traitement national ) , 1105 ( Norme of treatment minimum ) and 1110 ( Expropriation and compensation ) . 
the Antarctic and the regulation adopted in 1991 by the British - British prevented the exports of water in vrac are filed under the been that they are contrary to the right international , but no reference direct not is made to of the offences to the provisions of the NAFTA . 
the Canada to constantly increase the transparency in the procedures provisions to the regulation of the differences between a prohibited and a state . 
in the legislation of the possible , he encourage the opening in these procedures and ask to the requérant of do of same . 
the Canada is determined to one drew the administer introduced against him by the Sun Belt to the words of the chapter 11 of the NAFTA , if this administer is Before to the arbitrage according the rules . 
in the case DESONA , a court set in under of the chapter 11 of the NAFTA has recently the a judgment fully to the advantage of the Mexico , in concluant that the - this not had , in the here , legalistic no of his obligations to the words of this chapter . 
this is the first time that a court set in under of the chapter 11 of the NAFTA for hear a case involving a prohibited and a state makes a sentence final . 
in his findings , the court has set of the line clear as to the difference of the obligations duchapitre 11 regarding the Investment who had been raised in this case . 
the sentence shows that these obligations not are not extensibles , and that their scope is limited . 
the ORDRE orders OF 
the speech of the Throne 
motion of question in response - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator MLA , seconded by the hon. senator Furey , Honourable to the Adopted of a Adresse to His Excellency the Gouverneure general in response to the speech that her has given during of the opening of the second session of the 30 - sixth Parliament . - ( 
5e day of the resuming of the debate ) . 
the hon. Douglas Roche : 
honourable senators , he there a80 years about , in the turn of the Paix , this magnificent symbol of the peace who authority a comforting world to the Parliament of the Canada , . has recorded the words following , got of the Proverbes : " Faute of vision , the people in without preferment ; happy who be the bill . " 
, the time where we we préparons to enter in a new century and a new millennium , we should reflect intensément to this proverbe of the Saintes Écritures . 
what is our vision ? 
that envisageons - we for the Canada : a country of abondance , fact of great espaces , of industries and of resources , of progress technological and of great energies human ? 
how envisageons - we the Canada by report to the rest of the world , in this period crucial of the history of the world , where the human have the power of to the security to the humanity , on the world of God ? 
the arrived of a new century ask of centrer our attention not only on we - same in our country draft , but also on the village overall the possible by the prodiges of the Technology . 
when we regardons the world in the together , we should be surprised and shame of see the great suffering tolérées by the systems political of the world . 
the 20 century has been the more sanglant of the history of the humanity , then that more of 110 million of people have been driving during of the war , this who represents three time more that all the Late account to the War since the all Prime century after Jew - Christ . 
during that of the war are which and drink and of major amount of resources , the more those of our world grab their situation the eroded still more . 
sixty country the getting regularly since 1980 . 
the services of housing , of health and of education are occupation is in the world world . 
w ( 1500 ) 
same if we , to the Canada , are incredibly he in service of the standards international , this not is not a reason for be Commission or murmur of we . 
, the over of the ten last years , the number of poor to the Canada is past of 3,7 million of people to more of 5 million , this who represents 18 per of the people . 
more of 1.5 million of children , a child on five therefore , live in the poverty . 
the problem of the without - homeless has been qualified of disaster national by the mayors of the ten more major cities of the country . 
in all the Canada , the governments consistently in the funding for to the programs social , to the health and to the education . 
the governments réduisent their deficits to the backs of the poor . 
in the years 90 , the appropriation spent to the Program of assistance public to the development of the Canada have been down de37p. per , and yet , to the time current , our Estimates military not are pushed that of 19p. per to our Estimates during the being years of the War Cold . 
the Canada has dépensé690 million of $ for participate to the War of the Gulf et18 million of $ for the bombs larguées on the Kosovo and the Serbie to the spring last . 
, the Canada as to the abroad , we do opposite to of the disparités choquantes and to of bad priorities . 
in a world of abondance , the justice social seems more insufficient that never . 
we missions to of the war who not should not have place . 
the major showdown have of the weapons nuclear who it constantly in danger the humanity . 
the governments of the world funding a militarisme excessive to the backs of the poor . 
short , the priorities of the government in the of Estimates military are follement " by report to those who with the Estimates program to the development economic and social to a time where the lack of development is now recognized as the the more great threat that can know on the plan of the security the States the least développés . 
this is a situation of two negative , two measures to the risen immense in the framework of which the governments would of a side that they are unable of fund the needs social in reason of the deficits and genealogists of the other of the are great to the War and to his preparation . 
the year same who has followed the summit of the child in 1990 , who the is being by of the speech and little of money , the government has suddenly found 60 billion of $ for participate to the War of the Gulf . 
the industry of the weapons is if puissante and the influence is if envahissante that the - this affecte almost all the aspects of the society Western . 
the country Nations paying double 483 billion of $ to the Defence , but only 48 billion of $ to the assistance public to the development , who is supposed answer to the needs of security human of the regions the more déstabilisées in the world . 
same this small amount of assistance is has in question , but the appropriation military franchissent the process government without be filed . 
the reality , this is that a development economic sustainable could do into good number of the reinforcing pre to the War . 
this is that the lesson that we should from desannées 90 . 
he can happen that the employment of the force be legitimate in the soon of the peace ; however , if the . not redonne not to the Council of security the role prééminent as only source of legitimacy regarding the point to the force , the who short turnarounds to the anarchie . 
. not can let the NATO determine she - same to what time he there will point to the force ; yet , to the opportunity of the summit grand the fiftieth anniversary of the NATO , who the is own little after the beginning of the bombing to the Kosovo , the meeting have taken deliberately the decision of the credit the role of arbitre responsible of decide of the time timely of use the force . 
the gloatingly excessive of the NATO heritage now the inequality and the confidence . 
the Russes and the Chinese not are never a who dominé by the NATO . 
already , the consequences of the War of the Kosovo have beyond of far the cost human . 
the hopes that the . was for a system of security World the are fracassés against the écueils of the power . 
the confidence suscitée by this that . believer be the end of the War Cold is today today having . 
a new , to the armements nuclear is to fear if Washington , Moscow and Beijing not are not to work of new . 
the world the who all right to the gulf nuclear , perfectly peel by the India and the Pakistan . 
the danger that this the weapons nuclear will grew . 
this over should people the people of good will to the within of the government and of the society civil to act . 
the Canada not can more the exempt of a action décisive in the abstenant of vote to the Nations Nations , as during of the resolution introduced this year in the framework of the new program and Requesting to the showdown nuclear of the Engage without answer to enter of the negotiations Work to the Elimination of the weapons nuclear . 
that he the whether of the weapons nuclear or of the War of the Kosovo , this who is in because , this is the law of the right . 
how the right international will he imposed in the years to come ? 
the will he by a Oath military who wants of this that should be the right or by a effort within world who implementation on the respect of the law of the right in the framework of the Nations Nations ? 
is the question fundamental who the there to the Canada to the enter of the new millennium . 
honourable senators , same if the picture that I just of tracer is sadness , this is with hope that I like do opposite to the new millennium . 
my hope ahead in the better understanding that we we in as that community human of a world interrelié in each an of activity . 
despite the war , the hunger , the number of without - homeless and the diseases who touch of the million of people human , the world advance however to a new manner of lead the Affairs international , who require a more great participation of all and who is more represents on the people . 
this movement can create the conditions supportive to a culture of the peace . 
. said often that the War is inexorable , that she fact part of the nature human and that the human the battent since always . 
this analysis is lift . 
the people human not are not génétiquement programmés for do the War . 
he not there has no part they inherent to our nature who happened the violence . 
the UNESCO fact out that the War starts in the head ; of same , he we must do enter in our spirit the new concept according which the peace is absolutely necessary in a era technologique of destruction mass . 
for as the pessimisme present , he must recognize that the War not is not inexorable . 
the violence such that . the has view in Iraq , in Bosnia , to the Rwanda , in Somalia , to the Kosovo and , not émerge not inexorably of the interaction human . 
as the haine and the incitation to the violence panic by the inégalités Social and economic , and 7.02 to a supply easy in weapons Mudslide , are if evident , he is essential and none of discover how prevent that of the differences not escalate in conflict overwhelmingly violent . 
the real problem here not is not that we know all of the violence tender and of dispute , but rather that we know how act . 
be that we not justified no attention to the tueries who the produced in the regions who not are not to the centre of our interests , or then , as in the situation to the Kosovo , we déchaînons a civil of destruction under been of save the humanity . 
the examples of the points chauds in the world indicate that the potential of violence can be was by the application hâtive , habile and intégrée of measures political , diplomatic , economic and military . 
same if of were suffering are , , . not can deny that the parties in War have falling the weapons to the Salvador , in Namibia , to the Mozambique , in Africa of the South , to the Guatemala and to the pomp . 
the agreements of peace in Ireland of the North and to the East - East , same the they are précaires , are that the desire of peace of the man can come to across of the stories of conflict . 
since 1945 , the UN has rigorous 172 regulations diplomatic who have the a term to of the conflict regional , there including the end of the War between the Iran and the Iraq and the withdrawal of the troops encroachment in Afghanistan . 
the War and the violence are generally the consequential of decisions political délibérées . 
rather that of expect that of the conflict have move for speak and of seek then to consolidating the peace , he is more human and more effective of prevent the violence in the attaquant to his causes first . 
this is the secession of a approach for a culture of the peace . 
the efforts fuelled of the UNESCO in view of promote a culture of the peace are inspirants . 
in response to a ask who him had been reply by the Assembly general of the Nations Nations to that she tender the idea of a culture of the peace as approach in view of prevent the violence and the conflict armed , the UNESCO has defined the standards , the values and the objectives to to promote a culture of the peace . 
w ( 1510 ) 
a spirit of peace , this is a together of values , of attitudes , of traditions , of behaviours and of ( of life who reflect and analysis the respect of the life and of the rights of the human . 
this is reject the violence under all his forms and this is the Engage to prevent the conflict violent in the attaquant to their causes first by the seaway of the dialogue and of the negotiating . 
. not acquiert not a spirit of peace of the day to the next . 
, the place of being the way of thoughts the War , the Canada should support of all the negative the efforts of the Secretary General of the Nations Nations , Kofi Annan , who has underlined recently in these words the need of promote a culture of the peace : 
he seems sometimes that the culture of the peace not has no opportunity before the culture of the War , the culture of the violence , and the culture of the impunité and of the intolerance . 
the peace represents can - be a challenge of size ; she is can - be also linked of the actions conduites in of many areas and without doubt , to the opportunity , of a small the of inch of the opportunity . 
the process can the could to the time long and painful , to the time fragile and imparfait a time chosen . 
honourable senators , these ideas have been expressed with into to the conference in favour of the peace hosted to - Hague in May last ; this event of four days has réuni7 $ people of per nationalités different attack attend to of the séminaires and of the than , see of the expositions and participate to a myriad of activities in favour of the peace . 
for the defray of a culture of the peace , the Canada must develop of the political who exceptions the security of the human , the implementation in place of new coalitions and the any of new talks , who respect the law of the right , who privilégient the initiatives of peace , the taken of decisions democratic , and the interventions humanitarian allowable by the Council of security . 
he is finally of amend the political in into in under made of the billion of $ are spent to the Sudan and to the militarisation , then that , fault of financements , are sacrifiées of laudable initiatives in favour of the development and of the actions all also laudable in favour of the peace and of the security . 
honourable senators , the culture of the peace is a objective achievable , certainly , but he is also incontournable . 
in the absence of a culture of the peace , of the million and of the million of human now of périr . 
the Canada can - he work in favour of the law of the Nations Nations in the of resolution of the conflict ? 
I think that we the can and that this is same our duty of the do . 
the Canada can - he the associate with of the States to the views similar for convince the country pool of a ability nuclear of the Engage in of the negotiations to to eliminate this Sudan ? 
I think that we the can and that this is same our duty of the do . 
the mandate Prime of the Nations Nations - save to the generations to come the affres of the War - should Establishing a of the concerns fundamental of the government of the Canada . 
the perspective of a culture of the peace can we give a into creating in this next millennium . 
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , the senator Roche would - he of answer to a question ? 
the senator Roche : 
certainly . 
the senator Grafstein : 
the senator Roche and me we already discussed of this question . 
however , I like always hear this that he has to say , particularly in this who respect the role of the Nations Nations . 
the Secretary General has recently blamed the Nations Nations for their failure to Srebrenica . 
of other observers have said the same something , be that the Nations Nations had misses to the task seen the events s to Srebrenica . 
I you the remind briefly : the Nations Nations have established to Srebrenica a found where the people were be in security , but of innocence victims the enfuyant for the réfugier under the flag white of the Nations Nations there have been massacrées . 
the Secretary General Kofi Annan has said that this failure was output to the Nations Nations . 
how réconcilier the opinion of the hon. senator , who see the Nations Nations as a body overall , protector and pacificateur , with the reality of this body who , put before the difficulty , the find dépossédé , impuissant and without point ? 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
hon. senator Roche , I regret of duty you interrupt , but I must you remind that the time who you was Allocation is expired . 
are - you the leave of continue ? 
the senator Roche : 
yes , I ask the leave of continue . 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
is - this of agreed , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed 
the senator Roche : 
I you thank , honourable senators . 
the senator Grafstein has criticized reducing the Nations Nations . 
I hope that he not me in want not of say that the description not was not complete . 
I not I never said that the Nations Nations were a institution perfect , not more that I hustings the government of the Canada of institution perfect . 
however , he is certainly of support of the political who improve to establish of the conditions propices to the peace , and this is exactly this that understanding of do the Nations Nations . 
I donnerai a only example . 
the government of the Canada has seconded the training of a force police permanent who would mobilisée in case of conflict for save of the lives . 
, because of the Opposition of the major showdown , the Nations Nations not have not still agreed or the in implement a such force police . 
, the that of the next century , we should restore the law of the Nations Nations and not not allow to of the associations regional , same if this are of important associations as the NATO , of the replace to the authority of the Nations Nations to as of Main officer legal of peace and of security in the world . 
is what should be our point of mire .

the Day World of the AIDS 
the hon. Erminie J . Cohen : 
honourable senators , I rise the speak today today for out the Day World of the AIDS . 
, the least 109 country recognize this day , which draw the attention on a illness who affecte of the people in the world world . 
the Day World of the AIDS is to awareness more the world to this terrible illness and to to of the funds additional in view of there to end . 
he there has already nice lurette that the AIDS not is more assimilé to a illness of their . 
this illness contagieuse mortelle the attack to all the walks Social , without to the of the race , of the pardon or of the situation social or economic . 
ONUSIDA , the body of the Nations Nations responsible of study the illness and of retarded the spread of the virus , has recently released a report reaps the terrible threat that this outbreak fact weigh on the world world . 
someone 5,6 million of people will infected this year only , this who ups to 33,6 million the number of people human achieved of this illness . 
the impact to increased of 10 per by report to the year last , the AIDS continues of the répandre as a fire of brousse . 
the spread of the HIV properly to the use of Substances injectables is become a problem none . 
he is great time that the Canada resolution a approach in this who respect the health public , as the have fact already the Britain - Britain , the Netherlands - Lower , the Australia and the Switzerland , who overwhelmingly to the toxicomanes the access to various models of treatment , without the limit to the promotion of the forbearance , but all in rolls the assistance financial amounts to the centres of treatment . 
the twelfth Day World Annual of the AIDS the question to the young of the world world . 
the theme of this year is " - children and the young : 
Écouter , learn , live " . 
this is all to fact timely the given that , according the report of the UN , the most of the victims of the AIDS contractent the virus before of have reached the age of 25 years and long before of celebrate their 30 - fifth anniversary . 
. believes that the information with of the young is the approach the more facility who be for reduce the spread of the virus of the HIV . 
today today , 20 years after that the first outbreak that struck , ONUSIDA believe that the worse rest to come to least of a developing of the efforts in view of eradicating this illness . 
, the enter of the new millennium , we must focus our efforts on the education , the prevention , the improvement of the care of health and finally , hope - the , the treatment . 
for happen to to a term to this terrible outbreak , we must start a call to the leaders of the country of the world world to that they conjuguent their efforts . 
this not is that in working together that we can hope come to across of this illness .

question PERIOD PERIOD 
the Affairs foreign 
the dépassement of the Estimates of would for for some celebrating of the Canada 
the hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate and respect the question that I I raised the week last to the about of the Department of the Affairs foreign , who would beyond fun per the appropriation original some in the budget Main of the Estimates . 
the forecasts the are high now à130 million of $ for the business of construction , dont70 million for the construction of our Embassy in Germany in reason of the transfer of the capital allemande of Bonn to Berlin . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
this is shame ! 
the senator Stratton : 
these questions have been raised before the committee of the Finance to the time where he the looked on the Estimates Supplementary of the Estimates . 
I I asked to the the - speak of the Council of the Board of justify this dépassement of 50 per of the costs and of me give of the figures iterations . 
they have promised of obtain the information and the Leader of the government to the Senate has fact of same . 
I must recognize that the senator Hays has always answered enough quickly to our questions . 
I poured that he can be on a work more important , because the senator Carstairs there put more long . 
a Senators : 
he just of the Alberta . 
the senator Stratton : 
a contend would - he more effective that a Manitobain ? 
I not the believe not ! 
two questions have been raised , the a to the meeting of the committee of the Finance and the other to the Senate , the week last . 
they are relatively simple . 
I I last by find the response to according 5 of the daily The Ottawa Citizen of this morning . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate should can - be me ask the answers to these questions . 
I could him say that to Seoul , in Korea , he there has a dépassement of 22 million of $ . 
of more , this dépassement could have in the cancellation of the bill . 
the Department has bought a ground for 15 million of $ he there has five years . 
this ground is vacant . 
if . using the method of calculating of the interests on the cost of abdication choosing million of $ on five years , . getting a cost of abdication of 8 million of $ on these 15 million of $ . 
he there has then the residence to New Delhi , in India , who has cost 200 $ $ of more that provided . 
the senator Nino Nino : 
that represents many of money in India . 
the senator Stratton : 
that is - this who the what to the Department of the Affairs foreign for that he not can not control the costs ? 
I can understand that . know all of the body of off in the sector local of the bâtiment in a country given , but that not has nothing of new to the Department of the Affairs foreign . 
he fact this kind of something since of the years . 
he can certainly have a better control on the costs that to the time current , where the costs dépassent fun per the estimates robust . 
this is all to fact absurd that we we a bill to Seoul with a dépassement of 22 million of $ and that . the denies of so that the ground rest vacant . 
the Leader of the government want can - be answer . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the hon. senator of his comments . 
the senator homme man : 
répondez to the speech , I you please . 
the senator Boudreau : 
in a some legislation , I sharing the frustration of the senator to the regard of the fact that the Leader Deputy of the government not has not answered more quickly to this question in particular . 
however , I acknowledge also that in General , he does quickly and I the in thank . 
in this who respect the problems precise that the hon. senator raises , he is obvious that we we of obtain the more possible for our money in the case of all the bills of construction , in we fiant on the resources local of the country . 
, in judge by the information that the hon. senator has admit with we , these resources local have been someone little imprévisibles during the enforcement of these bills . 
I date of obtain of the information more precise for answer to the concerns of the senator . 
the senator has mentioned the case precise of the ground left vacant . 
. not can that hope that this ground civil that triplé of value since , this who we would of not not order of cost of abdication and can - be same of wasn a be . 
the senator Stratton : 
I believe that the Senate and the Canadians deserve of best explanation . 
these dépassements of cost are bashful . 
how réglerez - you this problem ? 
how empêcherez - you that that the occurring to the future ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
the senator has raised a point important . 
I I said that I forward to the senator the réassurance of the Minister that he there would a review of these problems and that , he must the hope , of the measures would taken to of avoid that that the occurring . 
the development of the resources human 
the level doing of the provision of the pension of the insurance - employment 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , imitant in that the senator Stratton , I like me also add a preamble to my question . 
in the report of the 19 November 99 , the Auditor General about of the surplus of the pension of the insurance - employment . 
the rate of premium to the insurance - employment are through by the Board of insurance - employment , who so of the representatives of the employees , of the employers and of the government , and they must be approved by the cabinet , on the recommendation of the Minister of the Finance and of the Minister of the Development of the resources human . 
these rate should allow of cover the costs of the program all in still relatively stable regardless of the graduate economic . 
he is normal that the . prévoie a level doing of the provision , but the bill not give no Previous on this who is a level doing . 
in a letter sent to the Minister of the Development of the resources human in July last , the Auditor General has underlined that the surplus of the pension of the insurance - employment today now the level of the 10 to 15 billion of $ that the actuary of the pension Justice sufficient for satisfy to the requirements of the bill . 
the Auditor General has said : to the Minister , the given that the surplus dépassait the level felt sufficient by the actuary : 
the the of the of present of the surplus , he there has place of book and of make the factors screening to determine the level doing of the provision . 
in the response that he give to the Auditor General , the government the summer simply of make the process screening to establish the rate and not give not the to the suggestion specific him enjoignant of book the factors screening to determine the level doing of the provision . 
honourable senators , to the end of March , the surplus of the pension of the insurance - employment will higher to 26 billion of $ . 
, a time given to the over of the next year financial , he forecast the 30 billion of $ . 
the case if , what is this amount and how is - he established ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , as you the know , he there has a very generous surplus in the pension of the insurance - employment . 
, comments , the generous surplus is the result of a healthy economy , of a economy as the that we know in the time . 
a of the consequences of a economy blossoming , this is that the needs are must answer the regime of insurance - employment are least have that they not the would in of other circumstances , and we we réjouissons all of this situation . 
by the of this growth , the premiums of insurance - employment have been reduced of way would to the over of the last years . 
I not I not the figures in with , but I can easily the obtain and you the to and I am am that the hon. senator knows that he there has had a reduction phased . 
some would that this reduction phased not is not opinions enough quickly or that she would should the continue . 
the Board of the insurance - employment , who establishes the rate , has adopted a point of view someone little different . 
, my notice , she the shows prudent . 
however , we should recognize that the government and the economy have the deserves of we have the in presence of this interesting challenge . 
the senator Oliver : 
can - be the hon. Minister has he devancé the Minister of the Finance and we has he given of the forecasts economic ? 
however , my question was specifically on the provision of the pension . 
if she the one now to 26 billion of $ and that she happens to the over of the next year financial à30 billion of $ , when the amount will he enough high ? 
what would according the Minister a provision get ? 
when the employers can - they the expect to benefit of a relief ? 
the senator Nino Nino : 
a allègement real ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the employers can the expect to of the allègements terms , as to the over of the last years . 
, the as and to legislation that the programs have given the results expected , of the allègements have been accorded by the government federal . 
, how must the rise the provision ? 
I not can give a response exactly to the question of the senator . 
that depends of the of of the economy to a time precise . 
of other factors can enter in line of the . 
what that he in be , he worth better pécher by excesses of taken . 
I not can give of opinion personal on the levels done of the provision . 
I believe not not me wrong in saying that if the surplus continues to increase , he the could very well the government contemplated of other cuts . 
the Council of the Board 
the report of the Auditor General - - licensing of markets to a provider unique - - to of a mechanism of review required of the markets 
the hon. Marjory LeBreton : 
honourable senators , in the report of November 99 , more specifically chapter 30 entitled : " - markets of services professionals conclude with a provider unique " , the Auditor General the is focused on the practice agreed by the government of credit of the markets of services professionals to a provider unique . 
according this practice , the government crunch of the contracts without approach to the competition , and this to the profit of a provider unique . 
the Auditor General the is also focused on a mechanism called the " notice of action of contract " , or PAC . 
honourable senators , the contracts are supposed be made by seaway competitive , however . what addition to the rules for choose a provider given . 
as the quoted the Auditor General : 
... the most of the markets that we we audited this year not résisteraient not to the review public . 
the figures are " . 
according the Auditor General , close of 90 per of the markets to fact the subject of a audit have been accorded in despite of the regulations . 
honourable senators , the contracts of 25 $ $ and more regarding of the markets to provider unique are approximativement 1,34 billion of $ of the Estimates of the government . 
however the services provided not are absolutely not age . 
of more , the amount of work proposed by the provider is rarely working of manner criticism , and the rules regarding the coupled of the PAC not are not properly observed . 
in addition , only a small number of these markets destiny to the rules sitting the point to a provider unique . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , we our all that , in the circumstances considered , the licensing of a contract to a provider unique not is not the better way of proceed . 
however , he can there have of the circumstances - and the hon. senator the knows surely - where this is appropriate . 
in this case - this , the Auditor General has given the opinion on some contracts . 
, the term of a review enough detailed of these contracts , he has felt that the lines guidelines not were not always observed . 
I am course that the Minister in question will good reaction to the comments urgently of the Auditor General , and I projection that he in will the and Glenney in consequential . 
the senator LeBreton : 
honourable senators , when he is question of 1.3 billion of $ or of 90 per , . can to speak of " approximativement " . 
this word has therefore a new means . 
honourable senators , still a time , the Auditor General has said : 
Élargir the face of the reservations or not not in to the represents a decision Raise , of the share of some officials , of amend the balance of the values that the government has established for orienter the conduct of his Affairs . 
I me deregulation of remind , honourable senators , that , same if in the book Red of 1993 the Liberal had promised of reduce the Estimates with to the services professionals and special , the government has increased substantially the point to the under - traitance . 
in fact , to the over of the put This Hour Has22 Minutes of the week last , . has said that the book Red would should win the National of the Governor General of the category of the his of imagination . 
trying he of preserve the power and the influence with of those who benefit of the contracts to provider unique ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , in this who respect the book Red , the government will felt by the Canadians in time timely . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
you there be . 
the senator Boudreau : 
he the can that I there am . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
not , you there be and , hon. senator , you souhaiterez be here . 
we properly that we also . 
the senator Graham : 
there be - you ? 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
I there be . 
Halifax - Centre . 
the senator Boudreau : 
we we more of candidates , if I understand well . 
this is a example that I not am not sure of recommend . 
for in to to the question , I believe that the Canadians jugeront the government on his performances general had regard to the book Red . 
I not think not that he there someone excuse that this be to the government for give of the contracts who not would not in the interest of the Canadians . 
the Minister will clearly take to the seriously the comments of the Auditor General . 
the senator LeBreton : 
if the contracts are accorded in the interest of the public , he not there has no reason for that we not we nothing know to their about . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the hon. senator has expressed clear his concerns . 
all the governments recognize that , in some case , of the contracts must be accorded other that by the system of while normal . 
the Finance 
the report of the Auditor General - - problems from to a under - estimate of the surplus budget 
the hon. Roch Bolduc : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
the Auditor General has underlined a deficiency in the policy of the government , who sphere to do of the assumptions too prudentes by report to the growth economic and to the rate of interest . 
he unless that this method was useful to the time of the deficits because she Pedro to the markets financial that all was under control , but that , in period of surpluses , she brings the government to spending more to the end of the year financial . 
according the Auditor General , since , if the . fact of the forecasts prudentes , the surplus real will probably higher to the surplus provided : 
, the time where that becomes obvious , to the end of the year , he is generally too later for influer on the results in reducing the taxes and the taxes , this who fact that the increase of the Estimates becomes the way the more effective of eliminate a surplus " excessive " . 
each of the two the Budgets contained of new Estimates important who have been imputées to the year where the budget has been tabled . 
honourable senators , the Auditor General said then that " that from very little of the Estimates of end of year Conducted by the departments who have of funds exceed , except that he the is not more of million , but of billion of $ who people of the spend of the taxpayers " . 
not is - he not time that the government révise this practice who is to Engage of the Estimates has in end of year simply for amend the importance of the surplus or of the deficit said ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I I read some of the comments that the senator refers . 
the Auditor General the concern of the fact that the government under - believe the surplus for a reason or a other . 
. can him give all the ; that the . to . 
in something these remarks , I me every of see to what point the time have changed . 
I me recall very well of the time where the Auditor General critiquait the government year after year because that he had surestimé the revenues , amplifié exagérément the data , seriously under - esteemed the deficits and , by therefore , was the people essentially . 
this is this that were some levels of governments , and this was a practice dangerous . 
of the point of view of the accounting or of the management , this is can - be a mistake that of be too prudent when . for the surpluses . 
in this case , this is a mistake who is of far better to the other so , that . has seen during if long in this country . 
the senator Bolduc : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the government using the same through that the colleague , the Minister of the Finance . 
of any obviously , the surplus budget of this year will higher to the announced in February 99 . At place of keep these funds , why the government not - he not the taxes all of the , knowing that he there will a surplus ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , of the projections have been made by various organizations and institutions yours in our country regarding the performance of our economy for a period of several years and the surpluses probable for this same period . 
in General , . for of the surpluses for the five next years . 
I am of agreed with the Minister of the Finance present for say that , same if of such projections are useful to some for of planning , the period should be many more short for the budgétisation and the planning of the programs government . 
of way realistic , a period of two years is to little close the period maximale with which . can work for the budgétisation and the planning of the programs . 
I acknowledge however that , if we are too cautiously and if the surplus is more important that provided , he not could can - be not be used immediately . 
the Defence national 
the report of the Auditor General - - implementation in implement of the Program of Ethics of the Defence 
the hon. Michael A . Meighen : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
in his campaign in favour of the bill of bill C - 25 , who was to amend the Act on the Defence national , to the spring of 1998 , the government has said to the Canadians that all the recommendations related to the inquiry on the events of Somalia had been implemented in implement . 
yet , in the part of the report to on the Defence national , the Auditor General out of first that the Program of Ethics of the Defence not has not still been fully the in implement . 
this program was the - cornerstone of the recommendations related to the inquiry on the events of Somalia . 
the Leader of the government agree he that the recommendations related to this inquiry not have not still been fully implemented in implement , and can - he we say when we can we expect to this that they the be ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the Minister and the Department working to the What of the program that the senator has mentioned . 
the criticism of the Auditor General was rather that this program not operated not as he should operate according him . 
this is a observation useful that the Minister will certainly to the seriously in his efforts in view of complete the implementation in implement of this program . 
the senator Meighen : 
honourable senators , I am anxious of see soon released a report we fear that . has debated the implementation in application of the program .

response regarding to a question orale 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I I the response to a question that the hon. senator Sparrow has raised to the Senate the 16 November 99 , to the about of the possible of protect more the people against the violence . 
the justice 
the possible of protect more the people against the violence 
( response to a question raised by the honorableHerbert O . Sparrow the 16 November 99 ) 
few provinces the concerned of the prohibit with violation of home . 
this type of behaviour criminal is serious and based of the fear to the citizens , particularly to the people seniors . 
the press , who has recently reported of the incidents to Vancouver , in British - British , has attention the attention on of such actions . 
according the Centre international for the prevention of the youth ( CIPC ) , located to Montreal , " flight with violation of home " the does of the effraction of home with flight qualified , this is - to - say flight of property with threat or use of violence or the two during the perpétration of the act criminal , or well with use of a weapon attacking or of a s of weapon . 
of such actions have place when the people are home they , the objective of these actions the of steal of the property , of the money and of the Substances addressed . 
in a report of 1996 on the statistics criminal to the Canada , the Centre Canadian of the statistics legal ( CCSJ ) has the the of the rate of impact of the prohibit with violation of home . 
the CCSJ publie of the reports on the major trends of the justice criminal . 
the prohibit qualified have decreased in 1998 for the second year consécutive , with a decline of 3 per , the effractions have decreased of 7 per and the actions criminals violent , of 2 per for the sixth year consécutive . 
during of the meeting of the under - ministers federal , provincial and territorial responsible of the justice , inducted and 26 February 99 , he has been agreed that the question of the flight with violation of home would referred to the senior officials for that be completed to this about of the opportunities of measures , legislation or other . 
a document to this about is in preparation . 
the Centre national of the prevention of the crime has borne to the CIPC a study on the ways of reduce and of prevent effectively the cambriolage of residence and the flight with violation of home , in which the degree and the magnitude of the - this will be évalués , to the plans national and international , and will be discussed the factors of risk and the best actions of prevention . 
this document will help to develop of the strategies not legislation of prevention in the of flight with violation of home . 
, the words of the provisions current of the Code criminal , a condemnation for flight qualified or flight with effraction system a only maximale of diversion to perpétuité . 
a such only reflects the fact that the Parliament consider that these actions criminals are very serious . 
if the flight qualified is made with a weapon to fire , a only minimum of diversion of four years is order . 
of the judgments recent with the flight with violation of home reflect the principles and the objectives of the determination of the only . 
of the , very unclear have been prononcées . 
in R . . Matwiy ( 1996 ) , per C . C . C . ( 3e ) 251 , where the contrevenant had made a flight with violation of home , the Court of call of the Alberta has felt that the actions criminals who them they to the right of the citizens to the security of their home and to the protection against the intrusions must be Softwood with the more great seriously . 
the court has reminded that the Court Supreme of the Canada also had recognized the uniqueness inviolable of the home staff and that this inviolabilité was the a of the principles of the way way since part . 
few judgments of the Alberta have prepared that the only minimum for the flight with violation of home was be of eight years of diversion and that this act criminal sort a only minimum more toughest that the flight to with they of a bank or of a institution commercial . 
a judgment recent of the Court Supreme of the British - British , R . . Bernier , has court to quatorze years of other a contrevenant who has participated to a intrusion in a home . 
the Justice Bouck motive his decision in saying that before that reappear the ridding of the country of domiciles , the Court of call of the British - British numbers a only of diversion variant of four to nine years when the into by effraction was particular of a flight qualified but that the magnitude of the situation was now that the Court the precludes of the only normally put in of such case ...

second Reading 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Stollery , seconded by the hon. senator Hays , Honourable to the second Reading of the bill of bill C - 4 , Act to implementation in implement of the Agreement concluded between the government of the Canada , the governments of States members of the Agency spatiale European , the government of the Japan , the government of the Federation of Russia and the government of the States - United of America on the cooperation Current to the Station spatiale international civil and Dolly of the changes related to of other laws . 
the hon. William Kelly : 
honourable senators , I am happy of speak today today of the bill of bill C - 4 . 
however , I want all of first congratulate the senator Stollery of the statement on the bill of bill , who was clear and of quality . 
the bill of bill C - 4 is necessary , because he provide to the Canada the grounds devise which he has need for respect his obligations to the words of the Agreement on the cooperation Current to the Station spatiale international civil . 
if I I well including , the States - United have ratified the agreed in April 1998 . - Japan the has ratified in November 1998 . - Germany and the Norway the have also ratified . 
the process of ratification is in over to the Canada , to the Kingdom - Kingdom and in of other country European , and the . the is set the 29 January 2000 as date target for the ratification complete of the agreed . 
he not there has that in Russia , country déchiré by of the problems political and economic internal , that the ratification not is not imminente for the moment . 
as each the knows , in our regime , the conclusion of agreements international is the prerogative of the Crown . 
the approval of the Parliament not is not necessary for the agreed proprement said ; however , she is necessary for harmonize some aspects of the legislation Canadian with the agreed . 
the the of the fact that he the is of a agreed international who has of the impact major for the Canada on the plan economic and in the sectors of the research and of the Technology and the the of the fact that the agreed with of several aspects until to now inexplorés , I think that . would could give to the Parliament more of time for examine the bill of bill and the agreed and that their impact . 
I the and I hope that these questions will scrutinized carefully in committee - of the least , I hope that they will examined more carefully that to the other place . 
what that he in be , I believe that this is a bill of bill which we should approve the principle with enthusiasm . 
this bill of bill is necessary for that the Canada can play the role of partner in the a of the more grandioses bills scientific of the history , to know the Station spatiale international civil . 
honourable senators , the participation Canadian to the Argonauts spatiale not represents certainly that 2.5 per of the cost total , according the estimates , but our task is to provide the Service of maintenance Bethune , or SEM , who will a part of a importance capital . 
, my knowledge , the SEM will to the patchwork of the Argonauts spatiale and to in ensure the maintenance during any his life useful . 
the SEM is composed of equipment and of facilities the finding as to on of the Argonauts that to land . 
among the elements to on of the Argonauts , . the the system of télémanipulation of the Argonauts spatiale , who is a gave spatial sophistiqué , and the system of maintenance Bethune . 
the Canada provide also the parenting to service special , who is a robot to two gave . 
the Canadarm and the system of télémanipulation of the Argonauts future all the two to the patchwork and to the maintenance of the Argonauts spatiale during any his life useful predicted of 10 years . 
the facilities to land Debates by the Canada starts a complex of operations of the SEM located to the seat Main of the Agency spatiale Canadian to St. - Hubert , to the Quebec . 
the Agency spatiale has been a important catalyst for the contribution of the Canada to the industry . 
the industry spatiale of the Canada is become a rouage important of the economy Canadian . 
as the senator Stollery the has fact out , she is to the origin of income of more of a billion of $ , which 30 per people of the exports . 
she represents 5 $ jobs in more of 250 businesses of a across to the other of the country . 
this is a industry in which the sector private Canadian has played a role of Prime plan . 
the sector private proceeds about a million of $ by year in R - D linked to of the bills spatiaux . 
. for that the participation of the Canada to the bill of Argonauts spatiale will 1.4 billion of $ and produces to the Canada more of six billion of $ and 70 $ years - people in employment . 
the Argonauts spatiale we will of do of the progress in the telecommunications , particularly in the telecommunications without son , who are if important for the Canada in reason of our great reference geographical and of our many communities vital . 
the Argonauts spatiale will of do advance the technical of observation of the land , a sector of two billion of $ by year who is in full expansion and where the Canada the is already as Leader of leadership through to Radarsat . 
in despite of the importance of the industry spatiale for the economy Canadian , particularly for the growth of the economy of the next generation , the funding government of the Agency spatiale Canadian is past of 378 million of $ in 1993 - 1994 to 350 million this year . 
I must say , honourable senators , that I hope that that not is not a sign before - coureur of a scenario which . authorization of time in time . 
we we in effect trend to conclude of the agreements , to we Engage in of the bills very important then to reduce gradually the contribution that we had agreed of be to the origin . 
I hope that this not is not this who the what . 
I I said more earlier that this initiative deserved , to my notice , our support from . 
I not say not that only in reason of the benefits economic to short term , but for several other ; . 
the Station spatiale international not has no role military direct . 
by example , she not can not serve to start of the satellites or of the missiles . 
that guarantees that she will only to of the for harshness . 
he must all particularly support and encourage the participation of the Russia to the bill . 
the experience Russian , with the Argonauts spatiale MIR , represents of great benefits for the bill . 
the module of service Svezda , launched in October by the agency aerospace Russian , will of first will of habitation and of centre of control of the Argonauts until to the arrived of the module USS Destiny , to the beginning of the year next . 
the fusées russes Proton and Soyouz are also of the elements important of the bill . 
the Parliament Russian not has not still " the process contacted of ratification of the agreement , but I believe know that the participation Russian the fact as provided and the shall . 
of a point of view can - be a little more absorbing , I say that the participation of the Canada him give the right of use the Argonauts for lead of the experience scientific and technical . 
in under of the clause 21 of the agreement , the results of all the business of research wishes by each of the partners would his ownership independent . 
for that the Canada is the better party possible of this opportunity without precedent , the Agency spatiale Canadian has the on at a program in microgravité to that the researchers Canadian diversifying of the experience in the conception and the conduct of experience and in the use of equipment spatial . 
the program in microgravité includes also of the funds for the training and the implementation to the point of the equipment necessary to the conduct of business of research in the Argonauts spatiale . 
by therefore , the Canada will fresher of a ability industrial and of research who him will of use the full ability scientific and of research of the Argonauts spatiale . 
finally , honourable senators , he there has 40 years , a young chairman American we off to the challenge of urge the new sector of the space . 
when he the has fact , the world vivait in the sovereigntist of the War Cold , in the fear Increase that the competition between the two superpuissances inherent by all to a conflagration nuclear . 
the chairman Kennedy not saw in the , to the space that a , to to allow to a superpuissance of the give a over economic , scientific , military and Johansson by report to the other . 
what move we we across ! 
, the over of a century who has known the first balbutiements of the required , we we sent a man on the Lune . 
we we sent of the sondes in the confins of the space . 
we placerons soon a microphone who we will of hear for the first time the sons business of the world Mars . 
we not are more to the doors of a new border , as the said the chairman Kennedy . 
we we now he this territory and we we doing to benefit of the many benefits that he Ben . 
however , he any more that all of out that in the framework of a initiative as the of the Station spatiale international and of any a series of agreements international to relates to the space , our occupation of the site not has nothing of territorial and is rather of the objectives scientific and of learning to the profit of any the humanity . 
we happen the space not not with of the instruments of War , but well with of the instruments of peace . 
honourable senators , drove of this spirit , I you please of well would study the bill of bill C - 4 . 
I will forward of participate to the time to the study in committee and to the step of the third Reading , if necessary . 
the the the Speaker : 
if no other hon. senator not wishes take the speak , I remind that he has been proposed by the hon. senator Hays , seconded by the hon. senator Moore , that the bill of bill the the subject of a second Reading . 
you pleasure - he , honourable senators , of adopt the motion ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
( the motion is agreed and the bill of bill is read a second time . )

( on the motion of the senator Hays , the bill of bill is referred to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign . ) 
the Act on the Assent Royal 
second Reading - Motion of amendment - Point to the rêglement - Adjourned of the debate in the Awaiting of the decision of the Speaker 
the order of the day Order : 
the hon. Anne C . Cools : 
honourable senators , I like do few remarks to the about of the bill of bill S - 7 . 
I was opinions the 9 June 1988 on the predecessor , the bill of bill S - 15 , who was identical . 
honourable senators , I believe in the Constitution of the Canada , in the monarchy constitutional , in his institutions and in Majesty Majesty , the Queen ElizabethII. 
, my arrived to the Senate , I I came oath of allegiance to Majesty Majesty . 
he is of my duty , the the of this oath , of confirm the rights and interests of Majesty Majesty in as that third part integral of the Parliament of the Canada . 
the Act constitutional of 1867 , clause 17 , states : 
he there will , for the Canada , a Parliament who will composed of the Queen , of a House high called the Senate , and of the House of the Commons . 
honourable senators , I thank the hon. senator Lynch - Lynch of have for the held of this debate who falls to point , of as more after the results of the referendum australien on the monarchy . 
the 6 November 99 , the Australiens have voted by 55p. per against 45 of keep the Queen Elizabeth II for monarque . 
the bill of bill S - 7 the on the prerogative Royal of Majesty Majesty regarding the granting of the Assent Royal to the bills of bill adopted by the Senate and the House of the Commons . 
the subject of the bill of bill is the Assent Royal who give force of bill to the bills of bill adopted . 
the bill of bill S - 7 there a problem constitutional important and none . 
how the Assent Royal , the instrument same who give force of bill to a bill of bill , can - she she - same do the subject of a bill of bill who , a time adopted , will receive the Assent Royal for have force of bill ? 
honourable senators , the prerogative Royal is the touchstone of the government by the executive and she makes possible the fact that the government be responsible . 
the prerogative Royal is if essential that the Statut of Westminster of 1931 stated that any amendment to the Kingdom - Kingdom of the succumb to the Throne or to the as Alaska or to the 1993 was receive the whatsoever of the parliaments of the States of the Commonwealth , which was part the Canada . 
the Statut of Westminster said in part : : 
whereas that he is , since the day is the symbol of the free association of all the members of the Commonwealth British and that they are represented by a common allegiance to the - this , of declare in preamble that would consistent to their situation constitutional the obligation of opt now any amendment of the rules of succumb to the seated and of Presented of the 1993 Commanding to the whatsoever of the parlements of the dominions as to the of the Parliament of the Kingdom - Kingdom ; 
honourable senators , the media have reported in September the act of the Governor General a , Mr. Roméo LeBlanc , relatively to the armoiries of the chairman - king , the lion and the language of the lion . 
the readers of the National Financial should know few facts regarding the prétendues armoiries of the chairman - king . 
the armoiries in question not are not " the armoiries official " Mr. Roméo LeBlanc , as . we the has said , but the armoiries royal used to the Canada , phase - and to wrong - appelées the armoiries of the Canada . 
of same , these armoiries not can not be appelées armoiries of the chairman - king because that they are part of the armoiries of Majesty Majesty of the Leader of the Canada , as the has confirmed the Recognition of 1921 . 
wide on a other Governor General who has withdrawn a insignia Alaska of the office of the Governor General , Mr. Meyer has wrote : : 
, the over of the mandate of Gouverneure general , Ms Jeanne Sauvé has recently the paper to letter , the plats and the assiettes of Rideau Hall , and until to the guérites of the residence of the Governor General , of the day who was used since the beginning of the Confederation . 
she the has replaced by this that his laquais décrivirent as the " lion chairman - Alaska " , this is - to - say the emblème who fact the subject of the dissatisfaction Mr. LeBlanc . 
some say that this is a generates absolute and a at for the House of the Commons . 
the ministers find simply too disruption of there attend . 
this is became too disruption for the Prime Minister , then for the ministers , then for the members , then also for the judges of the Court Supreme of the Canada . 
fumisterie ! 
the honourable senators , however , meetings faithfully to the Assent Royal in this Room , to the Senate , the House of the Assent Royal . 
honourable senators , I challenging those who argue that the Assent Royal is a may formality . 
they the trompent . 
their deal false or erronée not can , to force of répétitions , become true or fair . 
Benjamin Disraeli , who has been Prime Minister of the Kingdom - Kingdom to the end of the 19 century , has described in the thing of 1852 , Horse George Bentinck : 
has Political Biography , the real force and the real sense of the Assent Royal by the Queen . 
he wrote : 
in as that Division of the Parliament which the decision is final , and therefore sollicitée in last , the opinion of the sovereign remains free and not compromised until to this that the whatsoever of the two Houses that been received . 
this veto of the monarque English not is not not more a formula vacuum . 
he not is not difficult of imagine the case where the year , seconded by the sympathy of a people loyalist , could any a s anticonstitutionnel and a Parliament corrompu . 
honourable senators , this is the real place constitutional of the Assent Royal in our monarchy constitutional based on the responsibility government . 
the Assent Royal is this step Parliamentary and is the only step in all our process legislative Parliamentary where the three elements establish the Parliament the Subcommittee for form the Parliament of the Canada in the framework of the enacted of laws , of the changing of measures in laws . 
the Assent Royal is this act quintessenciel in our system of government first responsible who country the presence of the Queen to the Parliament , this point turning in the process of Adopted of the laws to the Parliament . - Assent Royal not is not a simple formality . 
this is a procedure essential . 
this is the act the more visible of the Queen of the Canada , who , since the Confederation , the fact to the Senate for of good reasons Constitutional . 
the senators must protect the visibilité of the role real of the Queen in the Parliament of the Canada and our Constitution . 
the Clerk of the House of the Commons is the under - Clerk of the parliaments . 
the huissière of the shall says is the messagère personal of the Queen who role this role between the Queen and the two Houses for allow to the Queen of the duties of his duties parliamentarians . 
the duties Constitutional of the Parliament of the Canada not can be accomplies that to the Senate . 
all the Parliament the meeting here for the speech of the Throne , that . was before the speech of the sovereign . 
until in 1947 about , the Governor General of the Canada had his offices in the Block of the East . 
still all recently , the Governor General had here , to the Senate , for proroger the Parliament and dissoudre the Houses - of the duties parliamentarians important who the exerçaient of way visible until to this that , for of the ; administrative , the prorogation and the disbanding the do in private , to the residence official of the Governor General , far of the " of the public , of his knowledge and of his understanding . 
the people not can not know , because that . the him his , his own language , culture and customs political then that the Position of the monarque in as that pivot is reduced . 
the convenience administrative not is not a ground valid for disbanding of the practices Constitutional essential . 
the former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau has described the strategy categorized current of the Quebec material " independence testy " , material " étapisme " , a concept invented by the late Prime Minister separatist of the Quebec , René Lévesque . 
they want such or such power now , such other power then , and earlier or later , the Québecois finiront by see that they are gouvernés more by Quebec that by Ottawa and they will then the great like in giving the to their bill . 
we in do as with the monarchy to the Canada ; we supprimons a says in the behalf of a Department , we do people a insignia here or that , we renonçons to such or such tradition , and of the . 
honourable senators , the senator Lynch - Lynch believe that the change that he move of to to the Assent Royal must to by a bill of bill . 
he has reason . 
a bill of bill the is for amend of way also fundamental the order constitutional of his Majesty and of the Senate to the Canada . 
the senator move of amend the prerogative Royal of Majesty Majesty in this who has relates to the Assent Royal given to the bills of bill . 
this change made a restriction . 
the bill of bill S - 7 limit the year of the prerogative Royal in the of Assent Royal and , same , limit the provision of the Senate . 
a amendment of the prerogative Royal of this magnitude not can be took that by the seaway of a bill of bill , in the respect of the practice constitutional , of the right and of the biodegradable parliamentarians . 
, the about of the consent Alaska , Beauchesne said : to the ) 726.1 of the sixth edition : 
honourable senators , this is a example of the étapisme of our monarchy . 
honourable senators , in this who has relates to the step of the deliberations surrounding the consent Alaska , lecommentaire 726 ( 2 ) of Beauchesne said : : 
the use to that the consent Alaska be " as the pre of the debate . 
the is makes nulles and not anticipating the deliberations pensioners in view of the Adopted of the bill of bill . 
, comments of the consent Alaska and of the second Reading , the comment 727 ( 1 ) of Beauchesne said : : 
the consent of the Crown is vital each time that he the is of questions an in because his prerogatives . 
well that the consent can be " to not any what step of the deliberations before the Adopted clear of the bill of bill , the use of the House to that he the be during of the Presented of the motion to second Reading . 
honourable senators , the counsel of Majesty Majesty , the ministers , the conseilleurs private , Futures pursuant to the rules determined , have , constitutionnellement issue , quality for obtain the consent Alaska . 
by therefore , during of the study of a bill of bill with the prerogatives royal , he there has all place of believe that they can mean the consent Alaska . 
however , for a simple Parliamentary , the situation is very different . 
for a simple Parliamentary of a party of Opposition , the situation is also interesting . 
if the bill of bill of this Parliamentary of a party of Opposition receives the support of the government , the situation would strange on the plan constitutional , because the ministers of Majesty Majesty , his distinguished counsel , in denying législativement and parlementairement of maintain and of defend the prerogatives of Majesty Majesty , belong in calling these prerogatives same , made they receive their authority , their power and their prééminence government . 
this situation risquerait of lead a crisis constitutional . 
however , I underscored here on the simple parliamentarians and on the legislation in which they could , with their bills of bill , amend the prerogatives royal . 
honourable senators , the communication who the is for obtain the consent Alaska of Majesty Majesty has been every in the fourth report of the committee Standing of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure , who has been presented to the Senate 6 November 1985 . 
I believe that this committee was then chaired by the senator Gildas Molgat . 
the third recommendation of the report said , to the page 1469 : 
that of the representatives of the Senate meeting of the representatives of the House of the Commons for write a resolution in view of the preparation of a question who must be introduced jointly by the two Houses to His Excellency the Governor General the advisable of well would approve some changes to the ceremony of the Assent Royal opinion in this report . 
the words key are " question " and " the advisable of well would approve " . 
all the sources who are authority suitable that the House must receive the consent Alaska in the case of all bill of bill who amend the prerogatives royal of the Queen , before that he not be adopted in this House . 
honourable senators , in this who has relates to the Position of the simple parliamentarians and to the obligation that they have to the House to the about of bills of bill similar , Alpheus Todd , in the thing already quoted , has wrote : 
this means should be given before the Presented of the bill of bill . 
but when a bill of bill of interest public who does to this description is supposed be presented by a simple Parliamentary , and not in under of the power of ministers , the House should the address to the Crown for him ask the leave of act to this about , before the Presented proposed bill of bill ; ... 
, no time he not has said how he continued proceed for ask and obtain the consent Alaska of Majesty Majesty , condition pre vital for that the Senate at and resolution this bill of bill . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch has the duty of present a question to Majesty Majesty the Queen for him ask of increase to this that we considering this bill of bill . 
this is on this motion to this question that the debate public and Parliamentary the ensuivra . 
motion of amendment 
the hon. Anne C . Cools : 
: said , honourable senators , I like propose a amendment to the motion . 
I move : 
that the bill of bill S - 7 not be not now read a second time , but rather when the sponsor remplira the condition exigée by the bill of the Parliament before the Adopted by the Parliament of a bill of bill of initiative Parliamentary amend a prerogative Royal , this condition preliminary the the means of the consent Alaska of Majesty Majesty to the study by the Parliament of his interests in the bill of bill S - 7 , who move of limit and of amend the formalités of granting of the Assent Royal by Majesty Majesty to the Canada , and of the same the of amend the provision of the Senate . 
the hon. Eymard G . Corbin : 
honourable senators , I like that . me being a question and a observation by the of the speech of her the senator Cools . 
in the framework of his remarks , she has used the word " laquais " in issue of the staff of the residence or of the office of the Governor General . 
the senator Cools : 
I I spoke of what ? 
I not I never nothing said of such . 
the senator Corbin : 
you the you well said . 
our practices parliamentarians we prohibit of do of the remarks certain on the human of the Queen or of the Governor General . 
I am sure that that the over also to the staff of the House and to the of the Governor General . 
I am also sure that the words of her the senator Cools have beyond his of . 
this not is not to me of him remind that he is inconvenant of use of such words , but this is very clear in the spirit of all . 
I me ask if the senator Cools would withdraw his words . 
I raises the question in the same spirit who we would we against to the use of this term for describe the staff of the Senate . 
I not believe not that we should describe of the so the staff of the residence of the Governor General . 
the senator Cools : 
honourable senators , I thank the senator Corbin for his question . 
I attention that he the wrong and that I not I not said this that he me fact say . 
I wish to say clear to all the world here that I am probably the more great partisan that the monarque and the Governor General have had to the Senate . 
I wish to well make that these comments not are not the pale . 
the senator Stratton : 
is - this that you we méprisez ? 
the senator Cools : 
if you want take the speak , not you gênez particularly not ! 
these comments not are not the pale . 
I the said , this are the comments of the chairman of the Division of the British - British and of the Yukon of the Corporation héraldique of the Canada , Mr. Rean Meyer . 
I I read to the senators a letter Mr. Meyer has written , the 8 September 99 , to the National Financial . 
if the senator Corbin the wishes , I him fournirai with happy a copy of this clause to that he can the examine and see that these comments not are not the pale , but those of the author of the letter . 
I wish to well make that I am so caring to the office of the Governor General that I love that the Governor General come here each time that a Assent Royal the is . 
my comments improve today today to encourage the Gouverneurs worry of the Canada to exercise their did powers in as that representative staff of Majesty Majesty . 
this bill of bill has his supporters as he has his detractors . 
. me said that several former Gouverneurs worry not are not delighted of some provisions of the bill of bill . 
I thank still the senator Lynch - Lynch of have launched this debate because the Assent Royal fact part integral of the Senate . 
when I I been appointed here , I I fact the oath of be loyal to Majesty Majesty and I jure before God of the be . 
this is exactly this that I am in tain of do . 
the senator Corbin : 
honourable senators , for to on this that I I said to the senator Cools , he not would not that she the wrong on my attitude . 
she has has many of sympathy home me for support the point of view . 
however , we must do attention to this that we say . 
he is came that , in the other place , the Speaker Justice that . not can not do indirectly this that he is , of do directly . 
when . quote a letter or a clause of newspaper of the pen of a human who not is not a another in the debate , his comments among those of the orator . 
well that this soitM. Meyer who the that wrote , this is the senator Cools who has proféré this word to the Senate . 
the senator Cools can in think this that she to , but I believe that that not made nothing to his applicable . 
I believe rather that that rabaisse the level of the debate . 
the senator Cools : 
point to the Rules 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I point the Rules . 
I ask to the Speaker of take in consideration this motion that he overcome then suggested . 
he not there has nothing in the bill of bill who amend the prerogative Royal or the Assent Royal . 
the bill of bill move simply that the ceremony traditional , who not is not subscribed by a bill , be préservée and , in way of other possible , that the granting of the Assent Royal the which to the way of a message . 
the prerogative of Majesty Majesty , the Assent Royal , third part constituante of the Parliament , demeurerait exactly the same . 
the bill of bill not fact that propose two practices different of granted the Assent Royal , which the a is the that we produced already to the least two time by year . 
this motion will more far that the bill of bill . 
she one a point who not is absolutely not raised in the bill of bill , to know the prerogative Royal . 
by therefore , I ask to His the the Speaker of the declare suggested . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I finish propose the adjournment of the debate . 
however , the senator Lynch - Lynch ask a decision and I not know not the he is of adjourn the debate in of such circumstances . 
if . can the do , then I move the adjournment . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , . has invoqué the Rules . 
the practice usual in this case require that the Speaker witness the other senators who wish speak of this point to the Rules . 
when the Speaker is of notice that the Senate has received enough of information , he can the deal or take the question in advisement . 
I entendrai therefore the other senators who want speak to the about of the point to the Rules . 
the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I am of agreed with the point to the Rules of the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
the bill of bill which we are before , and that I support , result of a practice of this House and not move nothing of more . 
the Governor General , and by therefore the Queen , must maintain a way of granted properly the Assent Royal to a bill of bill . 
the present bill of bill with of the process to follow for granted the Assent Royal . 
according my interpretation , this legislation legislative not impropriety no the prerogative . 
the objective of this bill of bill is of to end to a ceremony who had place in this House then that or the Governor General or the members to the House of the Commons not were attendance . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
our procedures conventions a series of guarantees . 
he must give a notice for that the honourable senators know to the advance what proposal will introduced . 
all condition pre put to the freedom of the legislative or of a Parliamentary of present a motion in the a or the other House of the Parliament must be explicitly the in the Rules . 
no rule not every of the obstacles that the senators should have to overcome before of power present a motion . 
the motion of amendment which we are before said clear that the sponsor of the bill of bill S - 7 should , before of present the bill of bill , satisfy to some conditions . 
I believe that this is that the point crucial of the order to the Rules presented to the Speaker . 
we must take great be of preserve the freedom who is multitude to all the honourable senators , who not must not be entravés by of the conditions other that those who have been determined for facilitate the good conduct of our business . 
the condition who is put here , according the wording direct of the amendment , move a form of censorship , in this sense that she move a so of review pre which all senator should the put before of power present a motion . 
the clause 2 of the Rules said : 
" bill of bill " : a bill of bill of the Parliament , that he be private or public . 
the legislation does to this definition , and he not there has nothing of other in the Rules which this motion of amendment can and , to my humble notice . 
the senator Cools : 
honourable senators , I like answer . 
without repeat all this that I I said , I ask that , for the study of the order to the Rules , any my intervention , the points that I I raised and the Statutory that I I confined be taken in consideration by Honour the . 
before of responding to the senator Lynch - Lynch , I wish to do out that the objection me seems suggested . 
of , , he not has not known explain why the motion is , according him , irregularly . 
I déconseille to the honourable senators of point the Rules in the hope of avoid of debate of some questions important . 
I not pretend not that this be this that the senator Lynch - Lynch was or had the intention of do . 
however , if the senator Lynch - Lynch raises a objection , he is of the duty , I believe , of we explain his ; and of quote the precedents and the authorities on which he the based . 
of after this that I I heard and this that the senator Lynch - Lynch has said , he not the has not fact in this case - this . 
my amendment is good . 
I not about here or of the content or of the well - based of the bill of bill in itself , contrary to this that has fact the senator Carstairs . 
the senator Carstairs support the bill of bill and discutait therefore of the content and of the well - based . 
for the moment , we are before of a order to the Rules . 
the honourable senators , all as His the , not are not without know that we not must not we in back to the Speaker of the Senate for manner the questions provisions to the Constitution and to the right constitutional . 
these questions must be settled by the together of the Senate . 
my amendment is not answer . 
I in I has copy to the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
I not I not said that he must him impose of the line . 
honourable senators , with this point to the Rules , he not the is not of determine if the senator Lynch - Lynch has the right of do this that he fact . 
this that we must determine , this is if the senator Lynch - Lynch welcomes of a manner who is consistent to the Constitution of this place , to the Constitution of our country , to the laws of our country and in the interest of Majesty Majesty the Queen . 
we we discussed been of these questions . 
I will read a of the statements the more assign never made on this question . 
this statement has been made to the House of the Lords , the 30 March 1911 , by Lord Lansdowne . 
the honourable senators the recall can - be that this was to the time a debate key . 
I remind to the honourable senators that he there has had to the Kingdom - Kingdom , to the time , a problem of the fact of the amendment of the powers of the Lords and of Majesty Majesty regarding the granting of the Assent Royal to the bills of bill adopted to the House of the Commons . 
this was a debate very important , honourable senators , and I me would attendue to this that the senator Lynch - Lynch , some precedents and information historic . 
for the moment , I will quote Lord Lansdowne . 
he has said : : 
, our notice , this is certainly to they to the right of the Parliament that of adopt , in the a or the other of the Houses , a bill of bill who has of the impact on the prerogatives of the Crown , that , without the whatsoever of the Crown . 
honourable senators , the consent Alaska equivalent to the whatsoever pre . 
he and : 
I think that human not the contestera . 
we concluons also , of after these precedents , that same if this Assent can be obtenue to not any what step , the procedure normal is of the obtain before the Tabled of the bill of bill . 
the or that I I used in my speech precedent shows clear that he has been agreed that the consent Alaska should be from before the Tabled of the bill of bill . 
all the sources by authority continued that he can be from , including by of the ministers Futures in the framework of their responsibilities , to a step later . 
he not fact not of doubt that this debate the on since of the years . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch not we has not said of what way he does satisfy to the Assent Royal . 
. can try of agencer the things not any how ; however , the fact is that any initiative or all bill of bill Parliamentary proposing of amend the prerogative Royal of Majesty Majesty must of first obtain the consent , this who is a other way of say that " the Assent must be granted to the advance " . 
this used , honourable senators , has over also in a other area of the prerogative Royal , to know the initiatives financial of the Crown . 
in the case of the recommendation Royal , this is more difficult . 
that is provided to the sections 53 and 54 of the Act constitutional of 1867 . 
this recommendation must be made to the House of the Commons before the Tabled of the bill of bill . 
as to the consent Alaska , he can be " more later . 
little any how . addressed the question , honourable senators , the fact is that human not can show of way again and credible that . can have a discussion to the Senate to the about of the future of the powers of Majesty Majesty relatively to the Assent Royal without consult of first the Governor General or Majesty Majesty the Queen she - same . 
this is specifically because that this question has been négligée and écartée these last years that I I presented this amendment to the motion to second Reading , to that a debate can the begin on the question of know if the consent Alaska is necessary . 
he me seems that he must more that the Senator outlive of the senator Carstairs or of the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
I I to the least statement the precedents and the facts historic and I can give still many of other invisible if the debate the on . 
the the the Speaker : 
, the order , the he you pleasure . 
senator Cools , I you I inquire because that I I had the Appendix that you vouliez speak of the further of the bill of bill and not of the order to the Rules . 
there has he of other senators who want speak on the order to the Rules ? 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
. not one not to the Assent Royal . 
this not is certainly not we who will that . 
he the is of a prerequisite constitutional that we respect . 
the bill of bill move simply of allow of express the Assent Royal differently , the form current the remained . 
by therefore , I believe that all the grounds of the motion are await and that this is this that should declare the Speaker . 
the the the Speaker : 
there has he of other honourable senators who wish speak on the order to the Rules ? 
if , I take the question in advisement . 
( adjournment of the debate in pending the decision of the Speaker . )

the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I not repeat not this that I I said more of a time here . 
if I me against to this kind of motion , this not is not that I want blame the chairmen of the committees .

he there has four committees in this situation , which the of the Affairs foreign , the of the Banking and of the trade , and the of the Affairs legal and Constitutional . 
I not want not say that he there has of the committees who are least important that of other , but this are that some of the committees the more active . 
someone a their has imposed a time who the force to sit to 15 p.m. 30 , knowing very well that he is came more of a time recently that we used beyond - beyond of 15 p.m. 30 . We are same achievement sometimes until to 17 p.m. ou18 p.m. . 
by therefore , these committees must ask constantly to the Senate the leave of sit in same time that the Senate . 
why not can - . not replicating the time of the committees and the adapt to the time of the Senate to the place of ask to the Senate of adapt the time to the of the committees ? 
this is also simple that that .

we should respect our calendar here and decide that , the Wednesdays , we lèverons the sitting to 15 p.m. 30 , little any the situation . 
this is this who had been agreed to the time . 
now , we done rarely the Monday last , but we want that the sitting of the Wednesday be always short . 
this system not works not . 
after the making , I hope that someone a carrying a calendar more realistic that the which we begin now . 
still a time , I timely my frustration , that many shared , to my notice . 
I am am that if , to our return in February , of the changes not have not been Regional , . refusera of give the leave for to the Senate to amend this calendar who , of any obviously , not works not . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I I taken the speak the last time that the senator Lynch - Lynch is spoken on this question , and I the am still a time . 
I not am not in disagreement with him . 
in fact , I understand very well the argument . 
in as that Leader Deputy of the government to the Senate - and I believe have the cooperation of the senators of in opposite on this question - , I believe that we seek to improve the calendar .

Energy , Environment and resources natural 
motion to to Authorize the committee to examine the Act Canadian on the protection of the Environment - Adjourned of the debate 
the hon. Mira Spivak move , pursuant to the notice of motion of the 2 November 99 : 
that the Senate urge the government to about on - the - face the review of the Act Canadian on the protection of the Environment and to give the first step of this review to the Committee Senate Standing of the energy , of the Environment and of the resources natural . 
that the Committee Senate Standing Senate of the energy , of the Environment and of the resources natural entreprenne on - the - face the review of the Act Canadian on the protection of the Environment as he is recommended unanimous in the seventeenth report of the committee who is 115 of the 8 September 99 and who has been tabled to the Senate the next . 
the the the Speaker : 
leave is - she granted of amend the motion such that proposed by the hon. senator Spivak ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Spivak : 
I move that the motion amended be on to my behalf . 
the the the Speaker : 
you pleasure - he , honourable senators , of adopt the motion such that amended ? 
the senator Spivak : 
honourable senators , this motion exhorant the government to about on - the - face the review of the Act Canadian on the Environment not is not my way hurling of proceed , or in fact the of the senators of this side - this of the House . 
we take power amend a bill of bill who it angry to wanting before that he not be adopted . 
unfortunately , we not we not could improve the Bill bill C - 32 . 
. we has imposed the stomping to two occasions , a time in committee and a time here , to the Senate . 
he not we has same not been possible of we ensure that a some clause of the bill of bill had well the same sense in French and in English . 
the senators of the other side have proposed in their report majority that the government stakeholder the next review of the bill of bill C - 32 immediately after the Adopted . 
that will to all the Canadians of express their notice and of follow the progress that fact the Minister in this who respect the Progress and the definition of concepts as the " strengths " , the " quasi - Elimination " , the " agreements government in the of Environment " and the " principle of the taken " . 
, our notice , let the are leave the pier then ask to the conducteur of to and of you say where will the are not is not a way of do . 
we we the duty of we ensure of the means of these concepts and of ensure to this that these concepts be clear définis in the bill of way to this that they be compréhensibles for all the Canadians . 
we we heard the pleas passion of a former official , who we has asked of not not overlooked of define this that he was hear by " cost - effectiveness " . 
he we has been asked of not not let the officials the dépatouiller all only when they at to apply the bill for protect the health public and the Environment . 
the senators of in opposite want do the things differently and they we have therefore fact of the proposals . 
, true say , a part of this that they have recommended not is not achievable . 
the review mindful , provided to the clause 343 , must allow of bye the entirety of the provisions of the bill and the operating . 
we not can not whether by where the are is past before that he not that made the parcours , but we can all of same bye the program of routing established by the mécanicien . 
we can we look on the guideline of application of the bill , ensured by the Minister . 
as the has proposed the majority to the committee , we can begin by give to the Canadians the possible of express their point of view and then monitor the evolution of the things . 
. not can deal that nine marine by day , 365 days by year , or plusde 13 marine by day , if the . the the of the days fériés and of the for of week . 
is - this that this is feasible ? 
presumably , some of these 23 $ marine not are more used and this would a real rallye that of seek to the discover . 
for those who the are still , the Minister has the choice between two options . 
then , the members can try of do the part the more complex of the work , this is - to - say obtain the data who recommend if the exposure to a substance to a does given on a period of time given is separate for the people human or for the Environment . 
in of many case , there including for some of the few marine who the find on the list of the marine of interest priority , the data of exposure are very difficult to obtain . 
this is for this unique reason that several marine not have not been réglementées . 
the second option who the offer to the Minister is to meet these steps and to credit the process . 
I know that , to least that he not choisisse this last option , some industries are ready to the continue in justice . 
he not would not in their interest that the members classent their marine chemical as toxic . 
I am désolée that this be someone little complex , but he would many of time for rapporter all the arguments and explanation who we have been provided during the process of this bill of bill . 
I hope that you me croirez on speak for this type of manila . 
that is - this that this will ? 
a process being or a process that some industries prefers . 
the members of the committee would implement useful , same the they not were that airing this who fact problem . 
he would also useful that the Minister ask the plan that he does follow for wasn the quasi - Elimination . 
our committee has received the note of service in which a of his senior officials had wrote that the quasi - Elimination , such that the new bill of bill the for , would impossible to wasn . 
we like know exactly how the Minister does proceed for obtain of good results . 
this is important for the Canadians , in particular for those of the North . 
. advocating the model Canadian to the negotiations in view of develop a convention World on the reduction of the polluants converter persistent . 
in the absence of a treaty rigorous , the Arctic Canadian continue of be the worse dépotoir to the world of PCB toxic such that the wastes , the products of the désagrégation of the DDT and of other products chemical bioaccumulatifs persistant in the air . 
by therefore , when the delegates to the for of the treaty on the POP the meeting in March next to Bonn , the Minister should be prepared to put to the review the model Canadian . 
of here that , we should have fact our devoirs and given to the Canadians the opportunity of express their opinions . 
for of the reasons very practices , I move that this review immediate that place before our meeting of the committee of the Senate . 
first , the program of the committee of the other place is already full . 
he not has not still succeeded to complete a review of the system regarding the pesticides . 
the Minister has promised a important legislation legislative regarding the cash in danger and , with a little of opportunity , we should have to we look on of the measures legislation regarding the change climate . 
our committee not has currently not a biggest backlog of bills of bill to study . 
second , this is our committee who has been submitted to the bâillon and who has proposed that the review starts the more quickly possible . 
third , the committee of the other place the is interested by intermittence to the Act Canadian on the protection of the Environment during six years . 
he the is well fought and , in across of blistering , the point of view has been rejected by a government who has listened the groups of pressure of the industry . 
he would fair of say that he has contribute all the efforts possible , of the least for a sure time . 
of this side - this of the House , the objective to long term remains of improve the legislation legislative . 
we item between other things speak for correct the fact that the legislation legislative not require not that the government resolution of the measures in view of eliminate gradually not would - this that a senior of the elements toxic the more polluants . 
these polluants are Mortgage for all the Canadians , and more particularly for the people of the North . 
the bill not require not that the government respect a principle of précaution who means really someone something . 
in reality , he there has contradiction between the two languages official . 
. excludes the tis of a participation to a new committee Advisory national . 
. not recognizes not the efforts loans volunteers by of the companies responsible of the sector private . 
he not there has no legislation they the of the concerns specific regarding the health environmental of the children . 
. reduced the power of the Minister of the Environment and . policies the taken of decisions to the Governor in board , particularly for this who is of the questions regarding the products of biotechnologie . 
. withdraw also the power of the Minister of the Environment of examine the effects seeing of products biotechniques . 
on this last point , . can the hope , the government am to present to new the bill of bill C - 80 on the foods . 
of the groups of interest and that of many scientific of the Department of the Health the are interestingly to this that the cabinet the empare of the power of the Minister of the Health of protect the Canadians , because this is the duty . 
I hope that this bill of bill will reformulé for the better . 
we had hoped study the question during many more of p.m. to the committee before that the bill of bill it not become bill . 
however , that not the is not happened and this is now of the history former . 
we welcome the senators of in opposite to support their own recommendation and to clamour a review exhaustive of the Act Canadian on the protection of the Environment by our committee the more earlier possible . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
her the hon. senator Spivak would - she of answer to a question ? 
the senator Spivak : 
yes . 
the senator Hays : 
the motion original of the hon. senator offences the government to take some measures . 
we we agreed that she be amended for that . written rather a study complete by the committee that the hon. senator behind . 
is - this that a something which the committee has discussed ? 
in of other words , normally , a work of this nature just generally of the committee to the the of his discussions and of the wish of about a study special . 
is - this the case in the here ? 
the senator Spivak : 
not , as the hon. senator Hays the knows very well . 
that the referring to a legislation agreed lines by the committee during the review of the Act Canadian on the protection of the Environment . 
if the Senate wish refer the question to the committee , I think that the committee will examine the question and see the he can manila this study in the calendar . 
he is question of about a review . 
the last has taken five years . 
this is in service of that that I pretend that our committee should about this review rather that a committee of the other place who , as the honourable senators the know , would many of other things to study before that that not we parvienne . 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , I know that . not had not discussed of the motion to the committee . 
is - this that the senator Spivak could raise the question to the committee Whole and we say the he to lead the study or not ? 
the senator Spivak : 
he appropriate can - be that someone a adjourned the debate . 
( on the motion of the senator Taylor , the debate is adjourned . )

the Day international of the people disabilities 
the hon. M. Robertson : 
honourable senators , tomorrow , the 3 December , will place the Day international of the people disabilities . 
the Canadians the joindront to of the million of people in the world for celebrate the progress made in the matter world with the people disabilities . 
the Senate of the Canada there at . 
all the Canadians , but particularly the Canadians disabilities , rely on we for promote their vision of a society where the equality of the opportunity for all would a reality . 
the senators are , well course , all to fact supportive to this vision , and today today represents a other not of more to the realizing of this vision . 
the senators the remember without doubt that in 1998 , we we are engaged to develop a strategy to to improve the access to the Senate of the Canadians disabilities and to their allow of participate more to the Affairs of the Senate . 
that includes the visitors , the Canadians back of the information on the Senate , the participation to the business of the committees , the employees of the Senate and the honourable senators of this House who are disabilities . 
we we deliberation for a approach to three consistently : a guide of the senator on the disability , a plan of action and of the sittings of training and of education . 
the " Guide of the senator on the disability " is a document of reference to the use of we all ; he give of the information and of the advice on the way of answer to the questions that the pose some Canadians to the about of various déficiences . 
this is also a guide practice who confirms our role drives in the research of the equality for all and of the changes to to to the level community . 
he is of a Reading quick and I the déposerai to the Senate the week next . 
I attention to the senators that this guide will also available on the Intranet of the Senate to of in allow the Reading with assistance technologique . 
the text paraîtra soon in braille . 
the second track includes a plan of action in the of disability , who the which realistic and give of the results mesurables . 
some of our colleagues and officials to the Senate have undertaken of develop this plan , encadrés by a team of experts of the condition of the disabilities . 
the questions are complex and the plan will relatively exhaustive , in this that he will of the information , every of the situation of the employment , of the assistance technical , of the facilities and of the security . 
this document in is to the first cycle of the development . 
the plan of action of the Senate of the Canada not will not our Environment , or of manner tangible , or of the day to the next , but he could , in time timely , serve of example to the other representations perspective . 
I am impatiente of me join to the senator Carstairs for you present this plan of action in February 2000 . 
the third track of our strategy the on the conduct of sittings of training and of education to the condition of the disabilities , includes a Consideration of information on the questions of appropriate disciples , a list of the major players of this community and of the information on the prospects and the obstacles in the next millennium . 
the document explicatif will also prepared in February 2000 . 
honourable senators , is how we can give to the together of the Canadians the possible of participate fully to the business of the Senate . 
he not is that fair that , in this that of the Day international of the people disabilities , we renouvelions our commitment to the regard of the integration and of the equality for all . 
the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
honourable senators , the senator Robertson the is montrée very generous to my place today today , in this that of the Day international of the people disabilities . 
, various occasions , she has spoke to the first human of the pluriel . 
honourable senators , he must understand that this is to the senator Brenda Robertson that we must this action . 
I I only participated to the production of the document who you will release the week next and to the development of the plan of action that you seen more later . 
of other people important have participated to this action ; they are guarding to the gallery North . 
if they are guarding to the gallery North , honourable senators , this is because that this gallery is now accessible to the people disabilities . 
are attendance to this tribuneM. Skip Brooks , Mr. Lawrence Euteneier , Mr. Jim Turner , Ms ; Fleury - Morena , Ms Pina DiFranco and Ms Julie Richer . 
are members Ms Marie Trudeau , Ms Bernette Quade Mr. é Clairoux . 
I thank her the senator Robertson of open the seaway to this initiative . 
the Francophonie 
the hon. Jean - Robert Gauthier : 
honourable senators , I about often of the Francophonie international . 
also , several people me have asked this that was the Francophonie . 
that me remind a experience , he there has few years fellow , then that I I had the happy of meet Valéry Giscard Ban Estaing , the former chairman of the France . 
I was informed of my colleague , the hon. senator Ban Ban . 
I I asked the question Mr. Giscard of Estaing , to know this that represented the Francophonie . 
he me has answered : " said is the France ! " 
I I including that he there had a misunderstanding , because that for me , the Francophonie , this not is not the France , this is many more that that . 
then I I sought and found the definition that is : 
the Francophonie is of first the community of the Peoples who , to of the degrees various , speak or use the French in their life national or in their relations international . 
but she is also a together of organizations and of associations , government or not government , incurred in of the sectors of activities and of the areas of interest common to the members of the community French . 
since the changeover of the member of the Francophonie , who Subcommittee the leaders of state and of government of the country to the French in sharing , the Francophonie is become a place of dialogue policy and of trade who well to the mobilisation of the resources necessary to the activities of the cooperation of the Peoples . 
honourable senators , I believe that this definition is exactly . 
the Day national of commémoration 
the tenth anniversary of the tragedy Westray to the École Polytechnique 
the hon. Catherine S . Callbeck : 
honourable senators , the 6 December 99 in the 10e anniversary of the tragedy Westray to the École Polytechnique of Montreal . 
the 6 December , he there has 10 years , a man armé of a fusil has election in the school and killed 14 women simply because that they were of the women . 
this event is a order cruel to all the Canadians of the fact that the violence made to the women is a problem by too draft . 
this tragedy we has forced to take conscience of the importance of this problem and has considerations our efforts in view of to end to the violence made to the women . 
the Canadians have acted in being the 6 December the Day national of commémoration and of action against the violence made to the women . 
, present , each year , the Canadians the remember and their tribute not only to the 14 women who are 116 this day of 1989 , but also to the women who live all the days under the threat of the violence and to those who have been victims of actions of violence délibérés . 
. has also organized of the events as the Campagne of the rubans counterparts , who encourage the men to put a taped white and to the Engage to not never make of actions of violence against the women or to close the " or to stay nothing on this kind of actions . 
the Council Advisory of the situation of the woman of the Island - Edward - Prince - Edward has the on at a Campagne of the rubans violets who famous the eighteenth anniversary this year . 
in the framework of this campaign , . distribue about 8 $ rubans violets and of the cartes to the people of the Island . 
this program contributes to awareness more the people to the violence to the regard of the women and of the children . 
the government federal and the governments provincial to the Canada have also taken of the measures recent . 
the Declaration of Iqaluit , proclaimed squeeze , the 6 December 1998 , in all the provinces and all the territories of a across to the other of the country , reflects the determination of the governments to to end to the violence against the women . 
this are that of the measures positive , but he rest still many to do . 
this year , the 6 December , I hope that we take all the time not only of remind the remember of all the women victims of violence , but of consider to of the measures concrete to take for avoid the violence against the women .

in September 1998 , 40 country had ratified the treaty , of so that the treaty is became bill international the 1 March 99 . 
the treaty testimony not only of a commitment to unable the world of the mines land , but is the result of the any of objectives humanitarian of the share of the government Canadian and of the Minister of the Affairs foreign , Mr. Axworthy . 
we should also one the work of Mines Diversity Canada and of other agencies animés of the same ideas who continue their efforts to of build a culture of the peace .

the hon. Janis Johnson : 
honourable senators , I like draw your attention on the events who the produced to the Manitoba to the about of the bill of dérivation of the waters of the Lake Devil . 
this is a behalf effrayant for a bill of be hydraulique effrayant . 
the state of the Crosby of the North for gushed the water in too of the Lake Devil in the saying Cross . 
as you the know can - be , the saying Cross facing the border for enter to the Manitoba and just the look in the Lake Winnipeg . 
the saying Cross is the habitat of someone 50 cash of poissons of water Freshwater and the biologistes consider that she is the second seaway of water the more rich to the Canada after the River St. - Lawrence . 
, because of the problems of flood to the Lake Devil , the state of the Crosby of the North to creuser a factual of drainage of three miles of long who resulting in the saying Cross . 
the Lake Devil is strongly salin and he contains of the products chemical toxic . 
something more important , . there ' of the poissons extremely agressifs and without potential commercial who are foreign to the waters Canadian . 
these cash of poissons are to the pool hydrographique of the Gulf of the Mexico . 
the saying Cross , as all the rivers of the Manitoba , the discredit in the pool hydrographique of the Arctic . 
these affected hydrographiques are divided by a up natural and their cash respective are demeurées separated since 10 $ years . 
the introduction of the poissons of the Lake Devil in the saying Cross would also risquée that the introduction of the peace in Australia . 
in as that senator of the Manitoba , he of a ground riverain of the Lake Winnipeg and member of the group of monitoring of the Lake Winnipeg , I can you ensure that that will become a bill very controversial . 
the Lake Winnipeg fact already opposite to of serious threats .

the levels of water artificiellement high have virtually destroyed the marais of the Lake Netley , we are .

is a a of the second page of this letter : 
he not fact no doubt that Inter - Canadian is the victim of political and of measures conçues for serve the interests of other stakeholders of the sector , which several have advantage to this that Inter - Canadian disparaisse . 
we we we to this that the shareholders of Inter - Canadian insistent for that we ask to our lawyer of examine the situation in detail and of take all the measures court and other to our clause for rectify the situation . 
what is the Position of the government to the regard of his responsibility for the difficulty that the chairman of Inter - Canadian said internalize by the of the events who have followed the ascertain taken to the words of the clause 47 of the Act on the transport to the Canada ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
I thank the hon. senator of his question . 
I not I not had the opportunity of study carefully the letter of the chairman of Inter - Canadian or his statement regarding the situation of his company . 
the he think have a ground for agrees of the the against the government of the Canada , I am sure that he the will . 
I know the magnitude of the difficulties financial that Inter - Canadian having now or éprouvait before that he be question of approach to the clause 47 . 
I not know not if these difficulties financial older of before this point or if they are account to of other factors debates to the and of this company . 
the responsibility of the government of the Canada has been stated clear by the Minister of the Transport when he has described the principle according which the service to the small communities Canadian is sufficient and continue of be sufficient . 
he is difficult of say if this responsibility the over to the fate of a company particular in of the circumstances data . 
the government and the Minister have clear established the principles of their action . 
I not will not the repeat , because I am sure that the hon. senator knows all the principles who guideront the action of the government . 
the Affairs Indian 
the Nova - Nova - - attempts of suicide in the contingency of Membertou - Request of measures concrete and stately for help the communities aboriginal 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
the week last , to Sydney , in Nova - Nova , four children , seniors of 9 to 13 years , are achievement in the forest in their contingency , profoundly to to crudely end to their days . 
two boys of the a Membertou , third contingency Mi' kmaq in importance of the province , have really tried of the those the life in the during to a tree - a with a chord to linge and the other with a chord . 
the police and the other children have succeeded to cut the string to time . 
of the communities are in crisis across to the Canada . 
of the children aboriginal , of the children Canadians the tuent . 
according a study specifically in 1997 to the University of Toronto , the rate annual of the suicides home the aboriginal seniors of 15 to 24 years is of about 110 for per $ people - in comparison of 25 suicides for per $ people home the people of the same group of age in the rest of the people . 
Tuesday , the board and the Leader of the a Membertou have imploré the Department of the Affairs Indian of the help in finançant properly of the programs of counselling for to the parents and to the children aboriginal . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I am to the aware of the situation general to which the senator has fact referring . 
I not am however not to the aware of the details precise of the incidents in question . 
what that he in be , the challenge that we pose of the communities as Membertou , and he there has of the communities of this kind a little across in the country , is real and there since of the decades , even since of the centuries . 
the government of the Canada attempts of and this challenge of a way constructive , to the way of the many programs services by the Department . 
I am course that the Minister in question chair seriously the requests made by the representatives of Membertou . 
in fact , I hope me speak with him and with few - each of the representatives of this community , to the over of the next days . 
the Nova - Nova - - attempts of suicide in the contingency of Membertou - - ask of the leaders of the a of meet the Minister 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , he is interesting that the Leader of the government that spoke of the Minister of the Affairs Indian and of the North Canadian , Mr. Robert Nault , because , as he the knows , the board and the Leader of the a Membertou have asked to meet directly the Minister . 
the Minister is - he prepared to access to this request ? 
if yes , when ? 
in the few weeks to come ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I not I learned that few minutes before of come to the Senate that a meeting had been demandée . 
I will do my possible for facilitate the things . 
in last resort , the decision is to the Minister him - same , but I know that he want to the of the circumstances who around this ask and that he can there access as that possible . 
the health 
the transfers of funds to the provinces 
the hon. Jean - Claude Rivest : 
honourable senators , I like ask to the Minister the he has the intention of awareness his colleagues of the Council of the ministers to a of the problems unambiguous of all the regions to the Canada , to know the funding of the services of health , of the services social and of the education ? 
if . reads the newspapers or if . following the situation in the hospitals of each of the provinces of the Canada , . note that the governments of the provinces are to the taken with of the difficulties major of under - funding . 
this lack of resources financial for support the quality of the care of to little close all the institutions hospitals to the country brings a Compared of staff and of Mothballed , a encombrement of the wards of emergency , a reduction of the resources and of the staff succeeds with of the people seniors , and cetera . 
the government federal has and has of surplus has . 
, the place of to on at of the bills who this a sure interest , as by example the scholarships of the millennium in the area of the education or , recently , a program for fight the diabetes , the Minister not think he not that he would time that the government Canadian implementation a part extremely important of his surplus to a transfer to the governments of the provinces ? 
in more of allow the good operating of our regime federal and the full get of services to the together of the people , this transfer of the surplus would to these governments of assume of a way décente their responsibilities Constitutional in the area of the health , of the services social and of the education . 
these needs constitute the basic of the good operating of our society . 
is - this that he not would not time that the government of the Canada from this ask burning who him is reply by the together of the regions Canadian ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
the challenges are of size in part to because of a increase considerable of the ask , who the to a sure number of factors , which the less not is not the démographie . 
, the over of the next decade , the factors demographic challenging always a serious problem . 
the government federal has well responded in the budget of 99 , but I not songerais not a only moment to say to the senator that he not there has not of great challenges who we waiting . 
the area of the health will can - be well the where the challenges will the more redoutables for the government federal and the provinces to the over of the ten next years . 
the senator Rivest : 
the government of the Canada , in more of the other priorities that he can clerical in the use of these surplus , not could - he not do , of a way free and direct , a transfer significant of funds to the governments of the provinces to that they so do opposite to the requirements extremely leadership of the area of the health ? 
you you been Minister of the Affairs Social . 
you But very well that without of the funds deprive , who not could from that of the government Canadian , you were out of answer to the needs pressants of the area of the health . 
a assistance calibre and substantial of the government Canadian will to the governments of the provinces of satisfy these needs . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I the I said already , since a year about , the government has taken of the measures for restore of important are of the funding paid to the provinces . 
, my humble notice however , he not enough not of increase the funding . 
that equivalent to thrust without has a ask illimitée . 
I believe that he will abolish the funding because the ask continues of increase and that he will also who the ability of to to the point of the approaches innovative as to the Benefit of the care of health and find of the solutions rector to this regard . 
a example of the commitment of the present government is the new funding substantial of the research in health . 
the government has fact evidence of a commitment remarkable . 
I I well confidence that he continue of the do to legislation that we exhausting . 
the hon. Roch Bolduc : 
honourable senators , I not like not continue we this debate . 
of a share , the government proceeds of the funds in the research medical and , of other share , the next , he announcement the creation of a program for the dystrophie musculaire and , the surlendemain , a other program for a other illness . 
the government federal , this by , define the priorities of the care of health . 
this not is not the role . 
do that to the backs of the responsibilities of the provinces is unacceptable ! 
you not be not convince our people that this solution is acceptable . 
the government federal , in amount , the ingère in the management of the care of health . 
he define that such service is the more none and not not a other . 
this not is not reasonable . 
the government federal has of the things more important to do to a level more high . 
the role is of there the resources to the country . 
he has of great roles to play in the policy international , the policy Monetary , and cetera . 
the people not the supportera not . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the senator has well reason . 
the Benefit of the care of health has been and remain without doubt a responsibility provincial . 
however , this would a mistake of say that the government federal not has of other role to play that the of sign a cheque . 
in fact , the Act Canadian on the health is probably the legislation legislative the more guiding of all the country in the of care of health . 
the government federal has a role to play . 
he not is not to the first lines of the Benefit of the care , because this role is to the provinces , I in agree . 
this is why the funding by the government federal of the research and some new initiatives of the kind will useful ; they will to the provinces of and the challenges on this plan . 
the senator Bolduc : 
honourable senators , I I the sentiment that the officials federal of the Department of the Health the say that the " guys " to Toronto , to Vancouver and to Quebec not are not that ; . will their say : where is - this that that press ? 
this was fair a appéritif . 
the Finance 
the report of the Auditor General - - effectiveness of the planning budget to long term 
the hon. Roch Bolduc : 
as he the has fact in the past , the Auditor General has said of new to the Parliament that a year of planning of two to five years , this is well too short for power to the of the consequences to long term of the choice budget that we do , including in a situation where the people population , with all the impact that that there . 
honourable senators , that not respect not the to of objectives or the they of these the . 
he the is of know the consequences to long term of the decisions of the government . 
same the committee of the accountable public of the other place has now idea to the need of projections to more long term . 
however , the government continues of say that in we giving of the information to long term , he minerait the importance and the emergency of the deal to the problems immédiats . 
honourable senators , the Leader of the government could - he explain why the Auditor General has wrong when he said that this not is that in songeant to the consequences to more long term that we properly fully in legislation of assessment the emergency of our situation budget ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the planning not has not that a only subject , and different periods of planning suitable to different purposes . 
I then say without fear of me wrong that in almost all the departments , the planning to long term the on of the periods of five years , of ten years , even more . 
, the for of the process budget , the Minister of the Finance has said that this was a approach prudent , but appropriate , that of the limit to a graduate of two years for determine of the requirements budget and of the projections of revenues specific for a year given . 
that not to not say that the government not the interest not to the planning to more long term and that he not the practice not . 
the senator Bolduc : 
honourable senators , the attitude of the Auditor General me believe reasonable . 
I am of agreed when the Minister said that on a basic of budgétisation of two years , that can be reasonable . 
I can understand that . 
the Auditor General said that the government should to to the opposite of the people of the studies to more long term . 
. has known that , by example , in the area of the Pension , where . has given of the Pension to the people all of the . 
. has given of the Pension to the people pendant25 years then , all of a the , . the is awakened . 
Mr. . Paul Martin has examined the question and has found that that not had more of good sense , that he was increase the premiums of 73p. per of here three years , if this would the bankrupt of this plan . 
that not is not course . 
the Auditor General the said , and I am of agreed , that he would we present of the statisques to long term . 
the example of the Pension is the more is example that . can find . 
. the is view that this was easy of give of the Pension to the people who not had not contributed . 
now , . ask to the generation next of pay for these Pension . 
and this generation receive probably of the profits who will lower to those of their parents . 
he not is not fair that my children me pay a pension then that the their will less when they will my age . 
same the increase of 73p. per , of here four years , not sufficient not for deal the problem . 
he must look the implications to long term . 
the government should the do a duty of apply a such rule . 
this is a rule of wisdom for a healthy management . 
not any what company the fact . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the Plan of Pension of the Canada fact course the subject of reviews . 
he is administered to the time by the government federal and the provinces . 
the two levels of government the Subcommittee all the three years s for draw the objectives to long term . 
I agree that , in fonctionnant without plan to long term , . risk of hypothéquer the generations future , who will appelées to pay for the services which take the generation current . 
the worse example that I can you give for illustrate that is the of a government who are of great deficits . 
the record of our government is excellent in this area . 
is the worse example who example the comments of the hon. senator . 
fortunately , the present Minister of the Finance and the present government have corrected the situation . 
I know that the hon. senator the pleased of their success .

the speech of the Throne 
motion of Adopted of the Adresse in response - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator MLA , seconded by the hon. senator Furey , Honourable to the Adopted of a Adresse to His Excellency the Gouverneure general in response to the speech that her has given during of the opening of the second session of the 30 - sixth Parliament . - ( 
6e day of the resuming of the debate ) 
the hon. Norman K . Atkins : 
you in arriverez can - be to goûter so the operating of this place that you me reconsidered your first comments regarding the term of your stay to the Senate . 
I I liked the response that the Leader of the government has made to the question that I him I raised yesterday , to know that he essaierait of visit the House Vimy before the resuming of the business of the Senate , after the break of ë . 
I would delighted of the there with . 
senator Hays , you you fact many of things in your life public and to the Senate . 
he was all to fact natural that you . guest to assume the duties of Leader Deputy to this place . 
this is became a tradition . 
your predecessor has been chairman of the Party Liberal , him also . 
your contribution positive to the business of the committees is also well known . 
your experience you will can - be to understand that he would course of consider the study of a more great number of bills of bill in committee Whole . 
personally , I hope that you be continue of be active to the within of the committee Senate of the agriculture , including in this period of crisis who Strike the céréaliculteurs Canadian . 
the senators of this side - this indicated the senator Graham as a Leader effective of the government to the Senate . 
he knew that the role was of do in so that the bills of bill be adopted to this place . 
however , in the year of his duties , he seemed appreciate the work of the Opposition and recognize the importance . 
our role is to debate of the bills of bill and to to to the attention of the government and of the Canadians the gaps that they conventions . 
the senator Graham has also recognized that the role of the Senate not was not to approve automatically the work of the House of the Commons . 
he is to the Senate of reflect more to the impact of the measures legislation and to the way which they are made , and of listen carefully the arguments of those who are in favour of these measures and of those who the there opposed . 
same the he we is came to the opportunity of differ of opinion with him , the senator Graham has always treaty the Opposition with déférence and considered the role of the Senate respectfully . 
this was a opportunity unique of do of the projection and of say to the Canadians to what the government see the Canada the lead to the over of the years to come . 
this speech would should establish the reason of be of the government , this that he to do with the power that he Canada . 
the years Pearson have been caractérisées by the commitment to the regard of a regime of care of health universal , our centennial and a new flag , this who has contributed to do know more the Canada to the other country of the world . 
the " society fair " and the patriation of the Constitution have dismantling the years Trudeau . 
this is during the mandate of Joe Clark as Prime Minister that we we are rapprochés the each of the other in as that Canadians , that we we learned to better we understand through to his description of the Canada as a " together of communities " . 
this is also to the over of these mandates that the Canada the is fresher of the grounds on which the economy based today today : the agreements of free - Exchange and the reform tax , which makes our exports competitive opposite to our partners commercial . 
he worth the only of examine the governments that we we any to the Canada to the over of the 50 last years for see to what point the government tien not has no policy and no vision of future . 
the Canadians deserve better that a speech of the Throne not appearing no vision . 
will more far . 
in this speech , the government the autocongratule without restraint for the role that he role in the economy . 
, this about , I want me associate to the words of the Leader of the Opposition to the Senate , the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
in the speech in response to the speech of the Throne , he has given to the government of the lessons of history and of economy on the responsible of the crisis financial that facing the Canada - the Liberal of Trudeau - and on those who have looked the basis on which the articulent the solutions - the Conservatives of Mulroney . 
for my share , I could back to the speech that I I given during of the debate budget in beginning of year . 
I I helpfulness the government for have balanced the budget , but I I also underlined that he négligeait of many leviers economic . 
the Canada not draw not enough of investment foreign , the taxes of all the levels of government are too high , our productivity is if low that she threat our level of life and no objective of reduction of the debt Canadian not has been set . 
a sure number of economists are that the dollar Canadian falls also there that 60 cents of here five years . 
the scenario of our " has in any a series of taken of control of businesses Canadian . 
that has led the former Prime Minister of the Alberta , Peter Lougheed , to declare : 
I me concern of the passivité of the governments , of the citizens and of the companies to the regard of the number of iceberg of businesses Canadian important by of the companies U.S. and then , of the loss of taken of decisions to the Canada to the the of the transfer of the seats social of businesses to the States - United . 
nothing not is fact , then that the Minister of the Finance continues of build a surplus for the happy . 
the speech of the Throne announcement of the cuts of tax , of the cuts that human not has still remarquées , who not performance same not to the surplus purpose in the pension of insurance - employment . 
the non of the government on the plan economic , the problems linked to the taxes , to the productivity and to the investment foreign have led Tom Ban Aquino , the chairman of the Council Canadian of the leaders of businesses , to declare : 
in fact , we we to Ottawa a government who not includes not the serious of the situation to which our country fact opposite . 
for them , the economy the the well , a number growing of people have a employment , the surplus the investments and the surveys are very supportive to the government . 
the people as you and me and well of other who osent ask a change radical and of new ideas are often which as of the alarmistes who not leads that their interest staff . 
the non of the government in these areas the country the more in the framework of the debate on the drain of the drain to the Canada . 
the Prime Minister believes that this is simply a so and I i that he think that if . not fact nothing , as in the case of well of other questions , the problem disparaîtra of him - same or . not him will not of accountable . 
honourable senators , this not is not the point of view of the experts who have attended to our caucus of the been to Calgary , in September . 
the representatives of the industry , of the sector private , of groups of reflection and of the world university we have fact share of the serious of the question and of the impact negative of this phenomenon , then that the Canadians trying of be competitive on the market world . 
well course , a example north of this that the Prime Minister believe be a so we is given by John Roth , chairman - steering General of Newbridge Networks . 
, the number of the major reasons for which our best professionals who the Canada , he quote the scenario of the dollar Canadian , the rate of tax marginal the more high to the Canada and the level exaltant of activity commercial to the outside of the Canada . 
this is by the through of political financial , rid and economic that a government creates a climate economic encouraged the people to stay to the Canada or to come the there dramatically . 
commentant the statements Mr. Roth , the categorized Canadian Peter C . MLA has said : 
I not believe not that he whatever say : " I want foutre my side of the Canada . " 
Mr. . MLA think rather Mr. Roth to say : 
" I not I not the choice . " 
the lack of vision of the government , the lack of vigour in the jurisdictional financial and economic , exception made of the measures to to balance the budget on the walk of the provinces and of the citizens the more poor of the Canada , are to the origin of this problem . 
the sacrifices of the government before a reality whose not fact that exacerber the problem . 
what is the interest of these benefits for the people who just regularly of a situation of work to a situation of well - be social ? 
as Marjorie Doyle , St. John s , Newfoundland - Newfoundland , the has wrote in October : 
the speech of the Throne of the week last not the rallies not to me . 
his letter described excursions the inadaptation of the promise of the speech of the Throne regarding the future of the Internet to the reality of the life in a port of fishing of Newfoundland - Newfoundland or in the Canada rural . 
she said : 
the vision of a Canada who fact of the high Technology the Railway of challenges seems insufficient , even same ours , when she is being to the time where you see a man débarquer on the pier his taken of hareng or of calmar to the assistance of a tool simple . 
, legislation that the speech of the Throne advance , adding to the glorification of all the things cybernétiques , that me remind that the gap between the Canada of the class dirigeante and the where of many Canadians live is in fact very great ... 
... and the creuse still ... 
he not is not possible that the small province independently of Newfoundland - Newfoundland be the only place where the people and the ( of life are marginalized , if outright suit , by the concept of a Canada who would the king Cyber . 
he must well there have not difficulty of Canadians in the regions rural where the space cybernétique seems périphérique . 
the day where the speech of the Throne has been given the week last , the road the more fréquentée of the small province independently of Newfoundland - Newfoundland was the move of land battue Work to the jardins , to the back of the community , of the jardins where the men and the women cultive of the plantes roots , a little as the were their ancestors to the beginning duXIXe century , working often on the same small carré of land . 
the men were to the fishing in their at , a piège of allure primitive had been put in the étang community , and the husband and the woman who have the forest olds durum . 
we not can not forget the roots of this country in the Rush current to the Technology . 
the promise of increase still the Prestation national for children in the year 2002 not to not say great - something for the poor or the recipients social , who g the provinces increase their taxes of as . 
, the least , in this party , we we set a group of work on the poverty , co of way very requested by the senator Cohen and the MP conservatrice of the House of the Commons representative the riding of Shefford , Diane St. - Jacques , in company of the senator Roux - Roux . 
the the the Speaker : 
hon. senator Atkins , I regret of duty you interrupt , but the 15 minutes who you were allouées have expired . 
want - you ask of the time Supplementary for continue ? 
the senator Atkins : 
yes . 
the the the Speaker : 
the leave is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Atkins : 
I you thank , honourable senators . 
their recommendations have looked the first basis of the to of a system of protection of the income family and of a rate of tax reasonable of the income of the special for the Canadians to income low and way . 
I commend the Leader Deputy of the government to the Senate of not not the be opposed to the ask of the senator Gustafson who was the held of a debate Special on the question the 3 November last . 
this debate has underlined the suffering related to the crisis of the agriculture and that the absence of a strategy national consistent in view of protect and of improve the situation of the it family . 
he not should not be necessary of expect that a crisis the " , as the government the has if often fact , for we to the that the political are déficientes or same inexistantes . 
as the senator Andreychuk the has underlined of way if concise to the over of the debate : 
the problem , this is that the government federal not includes not that he must do evidence of creativity and attempt of find of new solutions to the crisis of the agriculture in the Western . 
... ... ... we are in full crisis . 
still a time , the government lack of imagination and the shows out of understand the new problems . 
the debate that we we the to the Senate has been very useful , but he not would not should be necessary . 
the government had a opportunity in however of deal of the crisis in the agriculture in the speech of the Throne , and of establish of new questions and of the benchmarks for the to of political for the protection of the it family . 
all that would could be followed very quickly by the Tabled to the House of the Commons of measures legislation to to adopt these new initiatives . 
however , the speech of the Throne not contained nothing , nothing of the all for the regions agricultural . 
that say of the sectors which the government has spoke in the speech of the Throne ? 
in this who has relates to the question military , the speech has began on a their very bode , detailing our troops as of the soldiers of the peace to the over of the war global and in Korea . 
. ' , in the body of the text and under the as " - place of the Canada in the world " , the sentence next , who is probably the more fallacieuse never on in a speech of the Throne : 
the government continue also of ensure to this that the Forces Canadian be in legislation of support the role of the Canada for help to the security in the world and he the efforcera of increase the ability of the Canadians and of the Canadians of help to ensure the peace and the security in of the country foreign . 
that just of a government who has the our frigates of class World quasiment outlive in annulant the Purchase of helicopters provided by the government precedent and who the the life of our soldiers still more in danger in an the Purchase of new helicopters . 
according him , he would immediately injected to the least 500 million of $ of more . 
he not is more acceptable that the Minister of the Defence unless that the forces Armed will continue to in do more with least . 
contrary to this that he said , he not can not dies the budget , because he is too minuscule for be restructured . 
in a clause entitled : " Reforming Canada' s Military " , the Colonel to the retirement Michel Drapeau urge the government to revitaliser the milice and the contingency , to reduce the number of worry of half , to from the duties of the bureaucracy civil of the Department of the Defence of those of the command military , to eliminate the département of the Affairs public of the Defence , and to eyebrows properly our soldiers . 
for my share , I conseillerais to the government Liberal of to in implement the findings of the book white of 1994 on the Defence , that he has him - same released . 
, all the least , the government should avoid of speak of continue to eyebrows the forces Armed , then that he not has same not began . 
certainly , the speech of the Throne about of the need of increase the funding of the research and of the development to the Canada . 
I hope only that this funding does to the research fundamental in the universities , in of the areas that the universities they - same feel important . 
I believe that the government must go beyond - beyond of the Fund of the scholarships of the millennium announced by the Minister of the Finance in the budget he there has two years . 
I believe that the problem of the debt grew , who one of the thousands of students to the four across of the country , can be resolved with success . 
however , he must for that not only Engage the resources necessary , but also do evidence of imagination in the development of a program who not only assistance all the students post , but also the encourage to excel in the studies and encourage those who have left prematurely the school to there return for there parfaire their studies . 
I there will to the opportunity of my inquiry to the over of the next weeks . 
for so Rachna Gilmore , who has received recently the price literary of the Governor General , he is important of the with not only of those who marchent the " baissés , but also of those who six the stars and the allow of dream . 
this country deserves a government who has a vision of the future who be source of inspiration for the Canadians to the enter of a new century . 
we brush a government who can dream . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the hon. Rose - Marie Cool - Cool : 
honourable senators , I me question to you today today to of you do share of my reactions to the speech of the Throne given during of the opening of the second session of the 30 - sixth Parliament of the Canada . 
my thoughts conservation primarily on three themes : the small boyhood of the Canada , the congés parentaux and the security human , and particularly the security of the children in the country in seaway of development . 
... rald ... 
all of first , I me am that the priority key of the government the go to the small boyhood . 
I quote the speech of the Throne : 
no commitment that we take today today not will more important for the prosperity and the well - be to long term of the society Canadian that the of invest our efforts in favour of the very young children . 
he responsibility to the government of offer to the parents and to the families who taking be of their children a range of measures and of ways who support their efforts . 
the parents have greatly need of support and of smooth for do opposite to their responsibility first , who is the of take be of their children . 
the well - be includes of the children there several components . 
in Prime place , a break parental of 52 weeks will finally to the parents of the with more of their all - grandchildren without duty the give to the Custody of a tierce human . 
you agree , honourable senators , that give the Custody of a very young child to a tierce human demands many of préparations and of representations for the great majority of the parents . 
I can you say , as experience personal , that when my tireless special to the research is manifestation after a break of motherhood of six months , that has been very difficult because that the break of motherhood is of six months and that the most of the garderies to the children to a year . 
he is very difficult of find of the places in " for a period of six months . 
of , , the great majority of the parents wish access to more of support who their would of achieve a better balance opposite to the requests exigeantes of the world of the work present . 
the first years of life of a child are déterminantes for his health and the well - be to long term . 
honourable senators , the children living in situation minority to across the Canada deserve a attention particular if we want ensure a development widest for all our children and for their families . 
this is why he is very important of measurement and of know more specifically the needs of the children and of the families of the communities francophones and é of the Canada . 
the recognition of the identity and of the realities of the francophones represents therefore a issue majeur for the future of the children and of the young of the communities francophones and é of the Canada . 
all the children Canadian have right to the same services and to the same facilités of development . 
short , the importance that we effectively to the small boyhood today today will to of the thousands of children of enter their life of adulthood in by evidence of confidence , of creativity and of determination . 
addition the benefits social weaknesses from to the support of the development of the young children , the House of trade of Vancouver there see of the benefits economic well age . 
I quote : 
our findings 18.7 that invest in the development of the young children can reduce the problems social , increase the capabilities and produce a good performance economic . 
and she in so to the conclusion next : 
short , invest in our children is a good policy of interest public . 
I commend the House of trade of Vancouver of have adopted this Position in conclusion party for the children of the Canada and in defending their interests . 
honourable senators , you be surely all of agreed for say , as parents , and as great - parents in the case of some , that the family who éduque his children and subvient to their needs is the better touchstone of the good development of the children . 
the education parentale , the acquisition of the Paralympians and the support to the parents and to the families are essential for improve the conditions of life of the children . 
is why of the programs of development of the young children must be a part basic of the vision of future of the government . 
the third and last point of my statement respect the people and the development . 
the concepts of development and of security of the child to the Canada diffèrent substantially of this that they are in the country in development . 
a Environment favourable to the development human , and more am of the child , fact speak two concepts basic : the development human and the security human . 
well that separate , the two concepts the internship each . 
same the they not are not seldom , together , the security human and the development human purpose to the double objective of unable of the afraid and of unable of the need . 
the freedom of act of the people can be limited by these two fears , and for the members the more poor and the more vulnerable of the society , the poverty and the insécurité are related in a circle condemned . 
for parent this circle , he must of the measures for stimulate the development human through to the access to a employment stable , to the education and to the services social . 
the absence of these guarantees of security human represents a barrier beware to the development human without regard to the levels of income . 
if the people not have not confidence in the power of the society of the protect , they are little enclins to invest in the future . 
for build a world who efficiently many of price to the security human , he must begin by the preoccupied of those who in hériteront and act for the protect . 
the Convention Current to the rights of the child has dismantling a beginning , a way which the community international could the duties of the responsibility who we responsibility all opposite to our children . 
he there has few years , a song popular said : 
a child , care you décroche a dream 
then , honourable senators , us - we of dream . 
livelihood with me the dream that I I for that a day , . can offer to all the children of the world this that the . offer to our own children and to our grandchildren - children . 
( on the motion of the senator DeWare , to the behalf of the senator LeBreton , the debate is adjourned . ) 
bill of bill admissibility the taken of some decisions medical 
second Reading - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Carstairs , seconded by the hon. senator pin , Honourable to the second Reading of the bill of bill S - 2 , Act admissibility the taken of decisions medical legitimate relatively to the treatment of survival and to the treatment of the pain . - ( 
the hon. senator Roux - Roux ) 
the hon. Lucie pin : 
honourable senators , I rise the speak today today for defend the bill of bill S - 2 who stage the taken of decisions medical regarding the treatment of survival and the soulagement of the pain . 
I commend my colleagues who have fact part , he there has already five years , of the committee Senate Special on the euthanasia and the assistance to the suicide . 
any their reflection and all their work have been very productive . 
he must now do the necessary to that the bill Bill S - 2 be effective and that he be adopted without delay . 
honourable senators , to a time or the other of our life , he is came to the most of between we of we find to the chevet of a parent or of a friend very patient , in practices to of were suffering , often to few days or few p.m. of their death . 
we not wish that a something , and this is that this human subject this that he him rest to live in a comfort relatif , in the peace and the dignity . 
unfortunately , he so too often that the comfort and the dignity not be not to the Boteler - you . 
to been infirmière , I know the challenges are are face the professionals of the health in the of care palliative . 
we we all been trained for cure . 
in fact , all the system medical is built around of the concept of care curatifs . 
we not we not learned to help the unevenly and , for many of between we , the death is synonyme of failure . 
the professionals that we are are very aware of their responsibility before the bill , of so that the taken we us of to the death to across of gave . 
on the plan staff , can - be that the death we terrifie and that we we of the difficulty to do opposite to the overblown of the patients and of their families and to accept the sentiment of vacuum that the death millions . 
short , he there as and more of ; complex who we choose to maintain the life to all price , same when that the fact against the will of the patient and to the backs of his dignity and of his peace . 
I me am of the bill of bill S - 2 that I support with enthusiasm , specifically for the reason that he is to find of the solutions to the many reasons complex évoquées by the once of care of health for the acharner to save of the lives to all price . 
the things not are not clear in the of responsibility criminal . 
the bill of bill S - 2 has for subject of clarify the Statutory of bill existing and of we ensure that the best of the patients will respected by the system of care of health and that the coping will protected by the bill and the standards medical necessary for better to the of the wishes of the patients . 
more specifically , the bill of bill S - 2 states the conditions sitting on the plan legal the interruption of the treatment of survival and of the treatment of the pain a of abréger the life . 
in a Prime time , the bill of bill S - 2 the in a wording clear and easy to understand that he is juridiquement acceptable that the soignant given to the patient of the pharmacare in sharply may of inevitable his suffering physical , same if these sharply now of in abréger the life . 
the bill of bill has that the decision of administering these pharmacare is acceptable to the " of the bill only in the case where the intention is of inevitable the suffering physical , but not not in the case where the intention is of give the death . 
the bill of bill S - 2 establishes a distinction clear in service of the intention : he the is of relieve the suffering physical and not of resulting the death . 
this type of distinction of after the intention is to the basic same of our right pénal . 
in our right , he there has without has of the distinctions to do . 
I not think not that the bill of bill S - 2 which the the to the suicide attended . 
I believe by against that he clarifie the things and protects the professionals of the health , their allowing of ensure to the comfort and to the dignity of their patients . 
second , the bill of bill S - 2 specific that he not there has not of responsibility criminal when a soignant practice the forbearance or the interruption of a treatment of survival portion that the patient , then that he was in possession of his ways , that presented a ask unfortunate in this sense . 
honourable senators , all adulthood widest of spirit to the Canada has the right of take of the decisions regarding his life , little any if to the " of the other , they seem good or bad . 
each of between we has the freedom of decide of the treatment medical that he or she to or not to not , and that of the time and of the way of the interrupt . 
Mr. . the Justice John Sopinka of the Court Supreme has expressed very briefly this right in the judgment that he has the in the case Rodriguez . 
impose a treatment medical to a human who the refuses is a act of violence and the way way has recognized the right of from the interruption or the not - Administration of a treatment medical who prolongerait the life . 
that still , the bill of bill S - 2 not fact that clarify the circumstances in which the decisions medical are legal . 
the rights and the principles in because are now abinet by our system judicial . 
the bill Bill S - 2 specific then who can present a ask of forbearance or of interruption of a treatment medical , to the behalf of a patient who not is not in legislation of take this decision . 
honourable senators , he not enough not of clarify the context legal of the decisions medical , far of that . 
in third place , the bill of bill S - 2 Order the Minister of the Health and his Provincial provincial to establish of the lines guidelines national in the of care palliative , of forbearance and of interruption of treatment of survival . 
these lines guidelines are essential to the to of a practice medical acceptable in this area . 
our society is difficulty to the comfortable before the death . 
we in we afraid . 
we not go not in speak openly and take conscience of his means , of the sense . 
why in would - he other for the people who soignent ? 
why the expect to this that these people have of the skills innées before the death , simply of the fact of their profession ? 
the bill of bill S - 2 require also that the professionals of the health receive a better training in care palliative , learn how and when inevitable the pain and interrupt a treatment of survival . 
they must learn to apprivoiser the difficulties and the overblown that a illness seeks raises . 
the bill of bill S - 2 heritage the contexts legal and social of these decisions medical . 
I think that the bill of bill S - 2 can do many for that the wishes and the needs of the patients be respected in the system of health to that their comfort and their dignity be protected , for that the legislation of the life rest the objective of the professionals of the health but that . would also to the patients and to their families the right of decide this who their is the better when the death that . 
honourable senators , each family to the Canada is affected by this question . 
we know all and any someone a who has seen a it needless unnecessarily and which the desire not has not been respected because that the soignant knew difficulty the care palliative or addressed of be sue in justice . 
the bill of bill S - 2 will was Right as by the professionals of the health that by the families Canadian . 
I commend the senator Carstairs and I wish of good deliberations to the committee who discutera of this question . 
the hon. M. DeWare : 
honourable senators , we not we not the intention of delay the study of the bill of bill , but I believe know that the senator Roux - Roux will among we the week next . 
I believe that we must him let the opportunity of speak of this question . 
I will therefore adjourn the debate in the behalf . 
( on the motion of the senator DeWare , to the behalf of the senator Roux - Roux , the debate is adjourned . ) 
bill of bill on the perquisitions and the saisies international 
second Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
... 1540 ... 
this bill of bill had already been introduced by my hon. colleague , the senator Beaudoin , the 3 March last , during of the first session of the 30 - sixth Parliament . 
he is was recorded to the Paper in September last before of have received the step of the second Reading . 
honourable senators , in 1982 , our country the is fresher of a tool powerful for protect the Canadians of the interventions " of the state in their life privacy . 
he the is of the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms . 
the clause 32 of this last for that : 
1 ) - , charter the applies : 
has ) to the Parliament and to the government of the Canada for all the areas relevant of the Parliament there including those who with the territory of the Yukon and the Territories of the North - Western ; 
b ) to the Parliament and to the government of each province , for all the areas relevant of this Parliament . 
the clause 8 of this Charter for that each Canadian has right to the protection against the confiscation , the perquisitions or the saisies " . 
the bill of bill S - 4 is primarily to make a question important of right in this who has relates to the application of the clause 8 . Consequently , the clause 3 of the bill of bill S - 4 specific , and I quote , that : 
before of present a ask of perquisition or of back to the outside of the Canada to a organization or authority foreign or international to the for of a inquiry Current to a offence , the authority requested , a request to a Justice or a Justice of peace for that be made a order Motion the ask . 
this clause has for purpose of protect the individuals , to the Canada , against a perquisition or a back abusive who would place to the outside of the Canada . 
when a citizen will the subject of a inquiry ultimate to a présumée offence to a bill federal , the prosecutor General sake will obtain the Authorized pre of a Justice , as this is the case during of a inquiry to the Canada . 
that the happen before the Appointment of a letter of ask of assistance to the authorities of a other country for ask the back of documents who the find in this country . 
honourable senators , this bill of bill the based of the findings of the Court Supreme of the Canada in the v. Schreiber . 
memories the facts . 
the intimé , who is citizen Canadian , résidait to the Canada and that in Europe , and he well of the accountable to the Swiss Banking Corporation to Zurich . 
the government suisse has agreed the letter of ask and a order has been made Motion the back of documents and issues regarding the accountable of the intimé . 
no mandate of perquisition or no other Authorized judicial not had préalablement been obtained to the Canada before the Presented of the letter of ask . 
the Court federal and the Court of call federal had answered by the affirmative to this question . 
the because was scope in call before the Court Supreme of the Canada . 
the 28 May 1998 , the Justice in Leader of the more senior court of the country , Antonio Lamer , and that the Justice Claire - happy - Dubé have answered by the not to the question of right raised by Karl H . Schreiber . 
according the Justice in Leader , a order Requesting the back of documents banking , made by the Department of the Justice of the Canada and sent to the authorities Swiss , not was not enter in stake the application of the clause of the Charter . 
the letter of ask of assistance not was therefore not they to the clause 8 of the Charter and to the rights of Schreiber . 
the Justice Lamer wrote to the ) 24 of his decision , and I quote : 
the human who has of the property or of the documents in a state abroad short the risk that a delving or perquisition be done pursuant to the laws of this state . 
she not can not " expectation the expect " to this that that not the " not , if the laws of the state in question allow clear of such measures . 
the Justice - Heureux - Dubé , issue to the behalf of the majority of the court , was also of notice that the Charter not the was not to a government abroad . 
in the resources , the actions of the authorities Swiss not were therefore not subject to the provisions various clause 8 . Ban more , she not the was not to the letter of ask of assistance , because the Canada not has not by to the back or to the perquisition . 
in a opinion dissidente , the judges Frank Iacobucci and Charles D . Gonthier have agreed that the government suisse not was not of the all subject to the respect of the provisions of the Charter . 
by against , they have however esteemed Mr. Schreiber well of the expectations reasonable in the of life privacy . 
and , the authorities Canadian would should obtain a mandate before of send the letter of ask to the authorities Swiss . 
the minority has therefore concluded that the clause 8 of the Charter the was in the case of Schreiber . 
in consequential , the back of the documents banking demandée by the Department of the Justice without Authorized pre has brought they to the right Mr. Schreiber to the respect of his life privacy . 
honourable senators , several of between you have been of the reserves as to the scope of the provisions of the former bill of bill S - 24 . 
some believe that he imposera the provisions of the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms in the of respect of the right to the life privacy to of other country during of ask of assistance to the over of investigations criminal . 
I wish to you assure immediately . 
this bill of bill not has no scope extraterritorial . 
for attempt of you convince of this of of fact , we must of first return to the principles who guident the application of the clause 8 of the Charter during of investigations criminal . 
since 1982 , the Court Supreme of the Canada has spécifié in several rulings the principles who must define the scope of the clause 8 and the way of the apply excursions . 
Dansl' v. R . . Schreiber , the Justice Frank Iacobucci " that the text of the clause 8 give very little of give on the scope and the subject of the interests that he is to protect . 
in 1984 , in the v. Hunterc. SouthamInc. , the Justice Brian Dickson had defined for the first time the subject of the clause 8 . It the was of the protection granted to the people against the intrusions knew of the state in their life privacy . 
by against , the scope of this right was limited by the uniqueness reasonable of the Awaiting that has a human in the of respect of his life privacy in the circumstances of a case given . 
the Justice Dickson has explained and this approach in Hunter to the pages 159 and 160 , and I quote : 
the guarantee of protection against the confiscation , the perquisitions and the saisies " not is that a Awaiting reasonable . 
this control of the right guaranteed by the clause 8 , that she be position under the form not , this is - to - say as a protection against the confiscation , the perquisitions and the saisies " " " , or under the form positive as the right of the expect " expectation " to the protection of the life privacy , the that he must appreciate if , in a situation given , the right of the public of not not be importuné by the government must CPAs the not to the right of the government of the immiscer in the life privacy of the special to of wasn his for and , including , of ensure the application of the bill . 
in consequential , since the v. Hunter the concept of " Awaiting reasonable in the of life privacy " is the principle structurel allowing of determine if the clause 8 the applies and protects the rights of a human in a situation given . 
in a second time , the Court Supreme has interpretation in several decisions the clause 8 as to for effect of protect the people , and not of the site or of the things . 
this principle marked a change important in the subject of the right to the life privacy . 
this interpretation of the clause 8 not was limited or by the concept of ownership or by the right being in the of intrusion . 
in 1993 , that has country the Court Supreme to conclude , in the v. R . . Plant , that a human has a Awaiting reasonable in the of life privacy relatively to a together of information biographiques of order staff which have of other people to the about . 
the Justice John Sopinka , the really for the majority , has said : to the page 293 of the v. , and I quote : 
... ... ... for that the protection constitutional the applies , the information before must be of nature personal and confidentielle . 
given given the values under - underlying of dignity , of integrity and of self that he implementation , he is normal that the clause 8 of the Charter protects a together of information biographiques of order staff that the special could , in a society free and democratic , would Establishing and exempt to the knowledge of the state . 
he could including the act of information Honourable to opportunity of the details friends on the way of life and the choice personal of the individual . 
he seems therefore clear , according the court , that the subject Main of the right to the life privacy is by therefore the effect of a delving , of a perquisition or of a back abusive on the individual . 
the place where this legislation is exécutée is without importance . 
since the v. Hunter , the Court Supreme has considered that the clause 8 had for effect of protect , before the fact , the rights debates to the life privacy . 
he not must not be used for valider or condemn , after the fact , the intrusions of the state in the life privacy of a human . 
in this sense , the court has given to the clause 8 a interpretation based on the principle , of manner to this that he is more that a simple shut against the confiscation , the perquisitions or the saisies " . 
as the has explained the Justice Gerard - Forest in 1998 in the v. R . . Dyment , if the right to the life privacy of the individual must be sufficient , we not can we allow of not do point this right that after that he that been breached . 
that is inherent to the concept of protection against the confiscation , the perquisitions and the saisies " . 
honourable senators , as you the know , each individual efficiently a great importance to his life privacy and to the ways of the protect . 
the uniqueness of the concept of life privacy is such that , as that . there has brought they , . can rarely the ground in the entirety . 
by therefore , for that the clause 8 protects effectively the Awaiting reasonable of a human in the of respect of his life privacy , he must produce his effects before the enforcement of the delving , of the perquisition or of the back , and before the disclosure of the information . 
without this protection , he not would that very little of value in as that guarantee of the right to the life privacy the he not the was that for suspending , after the fact , of the information obtained of a manner abusive . 
this interpretation of the clause 8 has taken a form concrete in the prerequisite Current to the Authorized judicial pre that has stated the Justice Dickson in the v. Hunter . 
in this v. , he " that the court was , in a Prime time , weigh his decision between the right of the human fall to the respect of his life privacy and the of the interest of the state to the regard of the application of the bill . 
by the the , he was necessary of determine the time where this Authorized should be granted by a court . 
: had for purpose of prevent the confiscation and the perquisitions knew before that they not the produced . 
that not could be work that by a system of Authorized pre before the back and not by the through of a validation shipowners . 
in consequential , according the more senior court of the country , the clause 8 between then in stake . 
and , the right of the individual to the respect of his life privacy and the interest of the state in the of application of the bill are soupesés by the application of the process of Authorized judicial pre , before the enforcement of the delving , of the perquisition or of the back any . 
honourable senators , the courts have also cerné the concept of uniqueness brings to the sense of the clause 8 . In effect , for that a delving , a perquisition or a back be qualifiée of " reasonable " and not not " of abusive " , she must , according the Court Supreme of the Canada in the v. Hunter of 1984 : 
... ... ... have been préalablement Cabinet by a human neutre and impartiale who must act of way judicial , according of the ; reasonable and probable , of simple insinuations not the not Commission , and be done of manner reasonable and not abusive . 
the Justice Antonio Lamer has enumerated , in 1987 , in the v. R . . Collins , three other conditions who must be respected to the sense of the bill for that a delving or perquisition done without mandate not be not considered " abusive " to the sense of the clause 8 : 
... ... ... she must be Cabinet by the bill ; the bill enabling not must not she - same be abusive ; and the delving not must not have been done of a manner abusive . 
and , a delving , perquisition or back déclarée abusive can very to be valid as " reasonable " to the sense of the clause 1 of the Charter . 
until to now , the courts have fact a distinction between the saisies in the framework of Affairs criminal and the saisies in the context of Affairs administrative . 
the criterion of the case Hunter statement before the applies rigoureusement to the saisies in the framework of Affairs criminal . 
the Court Supreme has also indicated , in the v. McKinlay death of 1990 , that more the they of the right to the life privacy is great , more the guarantees of the v. Hunter must be respected . 
in the case Schreiber , the judges Gonthier and Iacobucci have expressed a opinion dissidente , as I the I mentioned more earlier , those - this the of notice that the back of accountable banking to the outside of the Canada , without Authorized judicial pre , taxing the right to the protection of the life privacy . 
in they to this conclusion , the Justice Iacobucci the is seconded on the interpretation broad and Liberal of the clause 8 of the Charter that I I explained more earlier . 
for determine if the letter of ask of assistance was contrary to the provisions of the clause 8 , the Justice has used the guidelines contained in the v. Plant by the Justice Sopinka . 
they had for purpose of determine if a human in because had , relatively to some information , a Awaiting reasonable in the of life privacy him giving right to the protection of the clause 8 . , the page 293 of this v. , he has wrote , and I quote : 
the review of factors such the nature of the information , the of the relations between the part divulguant the information and the part in réclamant the confidentiality , the place where they have been collected , the conditions in which they have been obtained and the serious of the crime by the subject of the inquiry , allows of pondérer the rights social to the protection of the dignity , of the integrity and of the self of the human and the application effective of the bill . 
several principles can be dégagés of this interpretation of the application of the clause 8 . Ban first , the authorities relating of the application of the bill must be sensibles to the right of a human to the respect of his life privacy , relatively to a together of information biographiques of order staff the regarding . 
the existence of a Awaiting reasonable in the of life privacy déclenche the application of the guarantees for by the clause 8 . you this Awaiting there and that the - this is danger by a intrusion predicted by the government , the authorities relating of the application of the bill are held of obtain a Authorized judicial before of act . 
suggesting the framework contextuel public by the Justice Sopinka in the v. Plant , the Justice Iacobucci has concluded that the intimé had indeed a such Awaiting to the regard of his documents banking Swiss . 
these the them of the details personal on the human fall , including his situation financial and of the choice friends regarding the way of life . 
second , . could what the reports who exist between the bank and the client of relationship of confidence who , following the v. Plant , give place to a more great Awaiting in the of life privacy relatively to the information in because . 
finally , if the information Treaty were easily need without intrusion or without the competition of a third , he there would then least of opportunity that he there that violation of the life privacy of the human concernée . 
in the resources , the information have should be obtained by intrusion in the bank suisse and with the competition of a third , this who parliament to indication that the intimé had a Awaiting reasonable in the of life privacy relatively to these information . 
of more , as the Justice Iacobucci the ask to the ) 56 of the v. Schreiber , and I quote : 
the procedure of perquisition and of back has been policy by the government of the Canada by the Presented of a ask if to the government of the Switzerland , seen the absence of treaty between the two country . 
the ask has been introduced in the framework of a inquiry Canadian who , can - . assume , would avid , to the Canada , to of the the raisers to a Canadian a offence to the Code criminal Canadian . 
the right to the life privacy , such that he has been interpretation in under of the Charter , protects the people and not of the site . 
the effect on the individual of a perquisition and of the back of documents banking is the same , that the perquisition and the back have place to the Canada or in Switzerland . 
the intimé has a Awaiting reasonable in the of life privacy relatively to the information banking , little any the place where the find the accountable . 
he is all to fact reasonable , to my notice , that the intimé the attende to this that the authorities Canadian not so directing the assistance of the authorities Swiss for obtain his documents banking in Switzerland without obtain a some form of Authorized judicial pre to the Canada . 
the Justice had therefore answered by the affirmative to the question of Schreiber and he had recommended of the neutralizes to the laws Canadian for correct this imprécision . 
this is exactly this that the bill of bill S - 4 is to accomplish . 
of , , the Justice Wetston of the Court federal and the Justice Linden of the Court of call federal are upon to the same findings that the judges dissidents of the Court Supreme in the v. Schreiber . 
honourable senators , he is clear that each case is particular . 
this is why the clause 4 of the bill of bill S - 4 for that the Justice appropriate , who can hear the ask former parte , must see that she is consistent to the standards determined by the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms . 
if such is the case , he can to a order Motion that the approach be made , and that the require the clause 5 of the bill of bill . 
honourable senators , before the Presented of the other provisions of my bill of bill , I like to the question of the application extraterritorial . 
in the v. Schreiber , the Justice in Leader of the Court Supreme has fact reference to the application extraterritorial of the Charter . 
for this do , he has used the rulings Terry and Harrer , who affirmaient clear that the proposal that the Charter not has not of application to the outside of the Canada . 
these two Affairs were on the conduct of authorities U.S. who , Futures to the States - United , had coast of the statements of suspects of a manner who , well that consistent to the Bill of Zinn American , were propensity with the Charter . 
in the two causes , the Court Supreme has concluded that the Charter not could govern the actions made by of the authorities foreign in a country abroad . 
this conclusion is consistent with the clause 32 of the Charter , who CRTC the application of this last " beyond Parliament and to the government of the Canada " and " to the Parliament and to the government of each province " . 
she is also consistent , as the has out the Justice Beverley McLachlin in the v. Terry , with the principle of the courtesy international . 
according the Justice , he was unrealistic of the expect to this that the authorities foreign are and observent the laws of the Canada . 
honourable senators , in the case Schreiber , the situation was different . 
already , the Justice Wetston of the Court federal had rejected the argument following which the fact of answer affirmativement to the question raised by the intimé government to apply the Charter extraterritorialement . 
he not has never has in question the laws on the respect of the right to the life privacy of the Switzerland or of the government of this country during of the back of the documents banking . 
the conduct misjudgment in the resources is the preparation and the Appointment of the letter of ask by of the members Canadian . 
these members were clear subject to the right Canadian , there including to the Charter , to the within of the Canada and , in the most of the case , to the outside of the Canada . 
they were far Treaty , to the clause 32 of the Charter , in as that representatives of the power executive of the " government of the Canada " . 
who more is , because that they were Canadians , he not there had no reason of to the of the courtesy international . 
. could therefore the expect to this that they are the right Canadian , there including the Constitution . 
he not was not unreasonable of from of them that they the respect . 
that is particularly true of the members who agissaient to the behalf of the prosecutor General and who , of fact , could have of the responsibilities further fully of the nature particular of this for . 
I wish to mention that the author of the letter not has not fact approve the content of the letter by the a of his senior . 
yet , as I the mentionnais more earlier , this letter " clear that the ask of assistance had for purpose of continue a inquiry criminal . 
she could give place to of the the to the Canada against a citizen Canadian . 
in the judgment , the Justice Wetston had concluded to according 944 , and I quote : 
... ... ... if the intimé can be sue to the Canada , I not see not why he not should not have right to the benefits accessoires of the Charter 
in consequential , he has concluded that the intimé had a Awaiting reasonable in the of life privacy . 
after have nothing this conclusion and have dependent the nature of the information who had been saisies , he has concluded that in under of the clause 8 , . was the allocations of a Authorized pre with of a Incumbent of duties court impartial before that the letter of ask can be expédiée . 
he is therefore clear that the Charter the applies of way general to of such letters of ask . 
some of between you will tentés of say that the letter of ask not is no set to a review based on the clause 8 . Vous utiliserez probably the example of the procedure that must follow a province Canadian for directing the assistance of a other province in view of the enforcement of a delving , perquisition or back . 
now , the authorities who this of such requests of assistance not have not to obtain of Authorized judicial pre pursuant to the clause 8 before of send their ask . 
he not the applies not as that the ask not has not been received , time where he must obtain a mandate Motion the delving , the perquisition or the back . 
, this argument , I contend : . 
in the context Canadian , the authorities who this the ask know that the - this will the subject of a review judicial before the enforcement of the delving , perquisition or back proposed . 
in the context of the case Schreiber , to the contrary , . not has not informed the court that the authorities Swiss would examined the touchstone of the ask of delving , of perquisition , or of back introduced by a government abroad . 
we not know not not more what form 7.6 a such review . 
however , . has mentioned that the . the him expectation to this that the authorities Swiss limited the to the ask . 
as the has mentioned the Justice Iacobucci , to the ) 57 of the v. Schreiber , and I quote : 
he is someone little formaliste of conclude that the procedure implemented to the Canada for examine the requests of assistance made by a province to a other allows of answer completely to the question raised in the resources . 
the application of a approach formaliste or legalistic is contrary to the jurisprudence Current to the Charter , who recognizes since long that the rights guaranteed by this text must be interprétés generously and in service of the subject described . 
he is more appropriate of apply to the question a approach based on of the principles . 
this result is consistent to the interpretation broad and Liberal constantly implemented by our Court to the clause 8 in view of " ensure to the citizen the right of be sufficient against the afflicted of the government to his expectations reasonable in the of life privacy " . 
not not apply the clause 8 to the letter of ask could have for effect of do into outright " between two chaises " the right of the intimé to the respect of his life privacy . 
I say that because , the the of the situation international in stake here , nothing not we guarantees that the principle of the Authorized judicial pre has been observers and , in consequential , the a of the pierres angulaires of the analysis based on the clause 8 has been omise . 
... 1610 ... 
the Canadians are protected to the Canada by the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms . 
honourable senators , during of the debate on the former Bill bill S - 24 , several of between you substantially raised the question of the costs important from to the application of this legislation . 
I believe , to the light of the requests of the years pensioners , that this process of Authorized judicial pre can be properly managed and that he not will not of costs important for the government federal . 
according the figures provided by the Department of the Justice of the Canada in the statement under oath who Adieu the memory of the prosecutor General of the Canada in the case Schreiber , the Canada has some 79 requests in 1992,80 requests in 1993 , 137 requests in 1994 , 109 requests in 1995 and doubling requests in 1996 . 
we not we not the figures of the years 1997 and 1998 , but I hope that the representatives of the Department of the Justice will we the provide to time during of the study of this bill of bill in committee . 
I wish to mention that the bill of bill S - 24 not the not they to the treated of assistance step who tie the Canada to some States foreign in the framework of investigations administrative or criminal . 
the Canada has concluded of the treated of this type avec16 country . 
I like now to the question of the regarding that the . find to the clause 2 of the bill of bill S - 24 . 
a officer public abroad is a human who Canada a mandate legislative , administrative or judicial of a state abroad or who ( a service public to the within of a state abroad . 
this not is not me who I created this definition . 
she the based of the the to the clause 2 of the Act on the corruption of members public foreign , who has received the Assent Royal the 10 December 1998 . 
the authority requested fall by this bill is the prosecutor General of the Canada , the prosecutor General of a province and any human or authority - , to the Canada , of the investigations provisions to the offences to the laws federal and to their any . 
this definition the based of the the in the Act on the corruption of members public foreign having lines . 
the offences simple by this bill of bill are those to relates to the laws federal . 
this bill of bill is therefore CRTC to the laws and to the regulations federal . 
the along of the Justice appropriate varies according the province . 
the expression " Justice of peace " 1 to the fall by the clause 2 of the Code criminal . 
finally , this bill of bill not has not of effect rétroactif . 
in conclusion , honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 4 will in so that the clause 8 will be took when he can help to accepting the repetition of a conduct unconstitutional by of the members Canadian , same if the conduct of these members brings a country abroad to to the assistance . 
the provisions of the bill of bill will in so that the Canada not can not impose his own standards procédurales to of other States . 
by against , he ups to this that the right to a Awaiting reasonable in the of life privacy be sufficient in case of delving or perquisition made to the Canada or to the abroad to the ask of members Canadian . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the senator Nolin we has given a treaty legal very fouillé on this who is , according him , the subject of the bill of bill S - 4 . 
I must say that he me will a sure time for well understand this that he has said , but I would a question to him question all of the . 
in listening the intervention , he me has me that he said that the Constitution for already a protection rather get . 
the senator would - he the please of summarized the reasons who justifying the Adopted of the bill of bill S - 4 ? 
I know well that he has was a sure time and well of the procedures for in happen that , but , of after his comments , the interpretation that the courts have given of the clause 8 assure a protection any complete of the right to the life privacy and also a protection against the the " , of the least if the . in Justice of after the case Schreiber and few other causes . 
the senator Nolin : 
the question one directly the essential . 
I hope that we able refer the bill of bill to a committee , because this is specifically this point that we must study . 
this is for this reason that I I quoted of many causes heard by the Court Supreme . 
in any honesty , the court contradicted the 18 last years of decisions regarding the clause 8 of the Charter . 
he has was many of time for establish the various aspects of the protection in under of the clause 8 . - court has also taken great be of determine that only the authorities Canadian would covered to the Charter . 
however , the judgment dissident of the two judges will more in the sense of this that I move to the Parliament , the given their analysis of the clause 8 . 
this is a question complex , because she require that the Parliament submit if the protection the in the clause 8 the on the individual or on the place where is perpétré the act . 
I am of notice , as the two judges dissidents in the case Schreiber , that this is on the individual because that the Charter protects the individual , not the place where is perpétré the act . 
he there has had , with the years , of many decisions and a important jurisprudence on the question to the Court Supreme , and the case Schreiber is , to my humble notice , contradictoire . 
I move that we corrigions that . 
in the case Schreiber , for streamline a case complicated , the government suisse is only a officer . 
all the other parties conducts in this together of facts are Canadian . 
the ask has been made by the authorities Canadian regarding a individual Canadian for a future any criminal to the Canada . 
I not know not if I made a response get to your question . 
I am sure that you flavour better this situation complex when you seen read my speech . 
I hope that the Senate will of agreed with me for that this question be referred to the committee . 
( on the motion of the senator Cools , the debate is adjourned . )

third report of the committee - Withdrawn of the clause 
the order of the day Order :

he him has asked , of first , the he commendably that the committee witness the testimony to camera closed or in public , then , if the union and him - same meddling a objection to this that the question of privilege raised by the senator Kinsella be matter to the committee in same time that the grief is heard by the Board of the relations of work in the service public . 
Mr. . Chopra has answered that he believer know that the Senate not is not a court who following the rules normal of the evidence . 
he believes that , in as that approach policy , the sitting of the committee Senate must be public . 
he not see no objection to this that the two reviews have place in same time . 
he unless to the Clerk that he believe that a review to camera closed not is to the advantage of human and that he not has nothing to hide . 
he wish only that the review to the committee be fair , public and enough thorough for deal the question . 
in more of answer to the two questions , he has also informed that the lawyer the accompagnerait to any meeting the by the committee Standing , and that he addressed that the Department could the acharner against him by the the . 
honourable senators , as the question in dispute was to know if the committee Standing should sit to camera closed , and that the witness in question not see no generates to participate to a hearing met , I ask that the recommendation of to a hearing to camera closed , who found in the third report , be withdrawn and that this debate be considered as debated . 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
honourable senators , the leave is - she granted of withdraw this clause ? 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) :

he me seems that the contrary the be happened . 
I am very surprised of hear the chairman of the committee ask that the recommendation of to the meeting to camera closed be withdrawn - I know why she has been introduced - after consultation of a witness . 
this is to the committee that he up of decide how he should proceed , and the witnesses must the plier to his decision , what that she be .

that means " the acharner against him by the the " in issue of the consequences for the employment the he appear before a committee Senate ? 
the senator Austin : 
honourable senators , I rapportais simply this that the witness had said to the Clerk of the committee . 
I not think not that I should answer to your question , since all this that I could say be of a proposition . 
I not has not of other information on the sense Mr. Chopra wanted give to this expression . 
the senator Oliver :

he has known this who the was only when the motion has been proposed in this chamber . 
if a witness said that . could the acharner against him , he me seems that we should obtain a little more of information on this deal to the place of we settle of a ouï - say regarding this who has been said to the Clerk of the committee and of the waves explanation of the chairman .

the freedom religious in China in report with the pactes international of the Nations Nations 
inquiry - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the inquiry of the hon. senator Wilson , calling the attention of the Senate on the freedom religious in China in report with the pactes international of the Nations Nations . - ( 
the hon. senator Austin , P ) 
the hon. Jack Austin : 
honourable senators , the Wednesday 24 November 99 , the hon. senator Statutes Wilson has attention the attention of the Senate on the freedom religious in China in report with the pactes international of the Nations Nations . 
his comments reposaient on his broader experience of the Affairs religious . 
our hon. colleague has acted as modérateur with of the Church united of the Canada . 
the intervention was the to a trip staff that the hon. senator has fact in as that member of the delegation of the Council Canadian of the Églises , who has fact a stay in China of the 23 October to the 5 November . 
many of Canadians , here same to the Senate and across to the Canada , the interested of close to the questions related to the rights of the human , particularly to the way which these values , who are criticism according our own concept of the relations human and of the stability social , are respected in China . 
this will on the China is inexorable for the simple reason that the people of this country represents about reach per of the people World . 
the systems of values and the practices of a if great per of the people of the world are essential to the to of a society human peaceful and Progressive to the the World . 
. has of the evidence clear who indicate that the China to promote the respect of the rights of the human to the within of the society Chinese to of unable the creativity of the people Chinese in the modernization economic and social of the China . 
the report of the senator Wilson is , to my notice , fair , balanced and exactly in this who has relates to the freedom of religion in China . 
in fact , the invitation lancée to the Council Canadian of the Églises for that he the non in China and at the freedom of religion is , in itself , a expression of the will of the China of Engage a discussion met and a dialogue moreover to the about of the freedom of religion as a of the aspects basic of the rights of the human . 
as in any society , . must draw of the line to the freedom to of ensure that the freedom she - same can be préservée and Rich . 
how find this balance is a optimist paradox . 
a Justice British of the century last has had to judge a because where the défendeur had crié to the fire in a into bondé . 
he not there had not of fire , but the people who were in the Room have paniqué and many have been any in the ruant to the " . 
the Defence has allégué the right to the freedom of speak , the right of say not any what not any where without regard to the consequences . 
in the judgment , the Justice has concluded that human not could the serve of the freedom of speak for say deliberately or of way entailed a mensonge who risk of resulting of the wrong to of other people of a way that a man reasonable could be . 
the idea that have the Chinese of the line to the freedom of religion is based on of the values cultural and of the experience historic different of the ourselves . 
the size of the China and his vulnérabilité to the dissension Economy , to the invasion by of the foreign and to well of other factors engendrent the pragmatism of the authority propelled and of the authority é for do régner the peace and the order . 
the traditions of responsibility collective exist since of the centuries and , in fact , have been dictate for ensure the security and the survival of the unity social , that this be the family , the village , the Cork or the province . 
the control of the behaviour of the individuals was perceived as essential to the security and to the well - be of the unity . 
we reconnaîtrions this practice in the maxime of John Stewart Mill , who described the policy social British as to " the more great happiness for the more great number " . 
course , in the reality , the autoritarisme the Adieu often of this is human that is the attitude arbitrary , this attitude who not there no legislation of protection against the inequity , the immoralité and the not - respect of the practices and of the standards ensure to the Ethics . 
well that the China be far of be the country the more corrompu of the world , the corruption there is still a problem serious in a society who just of about the transition of a economy governed the rending of the model marxiste to a economy of market Socialist , this is - to - say a economy of market to the sense where we the go , but a economy still governed of manner strategic and réglementée to the way of plans quinquennaux and of measures of monitoring of the performance . 
the he not fact no doubt that the regime policy of the China the based of the autoritarisme , he is also true that the Chinese the accommodent well of their freedoms economic and Social and that they not have never been also well since of the centuries . 
the government of the China not employ can - be not the same practices that the government of the Canada for allowed , but he the really to improve the life of his people to the place of the settle of enrich the group to the power , as that the fact in of other country . 
the Canada the is committed on several fronts with the China , this who demonstrates well the commitment growing to the respect of the rights of the human in the sense individualiste where we the go . 
we we of the groups of study abiding on the practice legal and judicial who it the focus on of the values as the burden of the evidence , the right of keep the silence , the independence of the power judicial and the role of a system of counsel legal independent . 
as the honourable senators the know , in 1998 , the Parliament of the Canada has the on at a association legislative States - Chinese of together with the Congress national of the people . 
two meetings of parliamentarians have had place , a in China , in November 1998 , to which have attended 12 parliamentarians Canadian , there including of the senators , and a other when of the members important of the Congress national of the people have visited Ottawa , Toronto , Winnipeg and Victoria for exchange of the opinions with of the legislators federal and provincial . 
among the issues broader , he there has had the practice legislative , the role of our Opposition official , the line cut to the government in the process legislative , the rules of procedure and the rest . 
the Chinese are very these to we understand . 
of our side , we are these to know how they perçoivent the idea that a debate peaceful not led not to a instability social and policy , but increasing the stability . 
the honourable senators not know can - be not that the committee Joint Canada - China of the rights of the human has been created by the Minister of the Affairs foreign , Lloyd Axworthy , in April 1997 . 
this committee is to speak a dialogue Standing on the rights of the human between the two country in an all particularly the focus on the Covenant international relatif to the rights civilians and political and the Covenant international relatif to the rights economic , social and Cultural , that the two country have signés but who not have not still been ratifiés by the Congress national of the people . 
among the issues precise broader by the committee Joint , he there has the rights of the women and of the children , the rights of the charged , the new rules of procedure criminal , the cooperation bilateral on the rights of the human , the cooperation international on the rights of the human , the rights of the minorities and of the Peoples aboriginal , and the freedom of religion . 
the recent visit in China of the senator Wilson , chairman of the delegation Canadian on the freedoms religious , the is made under the under of the committee Joint . 
he me must also make that the committee Joint is constantly active and working without tirelessly . 
the members Canadian members of the committee the are people on the ground in the province of the Yunnan , where the . find a great number of minorities Parliamentarians , and to the Tibet , where the debate the on on the question of the freedom of religion . 
the members Chinese members of the committee have as to them visited Ottawa , Winnipeg and Whitehorse . 
the question of Falun Gong has been most during of a sitting of the committee Joint to Beijing the 8 et9 November 99 . - 4 November , the question has been raised of new by the senator Wilson and his delegation when they have met of the senior Allison to the offices of the Department of the Affairs foreign of China , to Beijing . 
that the said , he any of understand that he there a myriad of questions related to the practices Chinese in the of rights of the human who attireront our attention in the months to come . 
the extensive reforms economic in over in China are to the origin of unrest social and political , the million of Chinese sacrifiés on the altar of the efficiency economic not to not access to a system of security social similar to the that we we to the Canada . 
the levels social and economic lower are particularly indignés by the corruption in China . 
the behaviour arbitrary of the simple officials , including in the back - country , is a because of dissension . 
. note of the agitation policy to the Tibet and in the Xinjiang where is established a minority turque and musulmane . 
the government Chinese continue of give the priority to the stability rather that to the reforms structurelles of the system policy and legal . 
short , since 20 years , of great progress have been made to the chapter of the rights of the human in China , and I believe that this trend the " . 
the recount of the China to the Organization World of the trade will a important stimulus . 
the Canada and the China have signed their agreement on the recount of the China to the WTO to Toronto , Friday last , the 26 November , to the opportunity of the meeting Annual of quelque250 members of the Canada - China Business Rehabilitation . 
the WTO is a system of rules trade including a process of regulation of the differences . 
the China has clear idea to the principle of the law of the right . 
in the years to come , she approfondira his understanding and his implementation in practice of this principle . 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
I like question a question to the hon. senator . 
this that he has said on the fact that the Chinese the pertinent to a economy of market , but with a direction very centralisée , me has interested . 
the next time that my colleague will in China for a meeting of the group legislative States - Chinese , the chargera he of to in Custody the Chinese in their expliquant that the Canada has tried the same formula in the years 80 , with of the initiatives such that the AEIE and the Program Energy national , and that that the is valve a disaster total ? 
the senator Austin : 
I will deal the question of the senator Murray as a argument . 
( on the motion of the senator Nino Nino , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the Estimates of the Estimates of 99 - 2000 
notice of motion to Authorized to the committee of the Finance national to study the Budgets of the Estimates - Adjourned of the debate 
the hon. Lowell Murray , pursuant to the notice 1 December 99 , move : 
that the Committee Senate Standing of the Finance national be authorized to study , to of in do report , the Estimates expenditures in the Estimates of the Estimates for the year financial the ending the 31 March 2000 ; and 
that the committee , the report to the more later 31 March 2000 . 
motion of amendment 
the hon. Fernand Robichaud : 
honourable senators , I like propose a amendment to this motion the to a meeting of the committee of the fisheries , yesterday last . 
this amendment has been agreed to the unanimously by all the members of the committee : 
that the motion be amended , by adding , after the words , " the Estimates of the Estimates for the year financial the ending the 31 March 2000 " , of this who following : 
" to the exception of the appropriation 1 , 5 and 10 of the Fisheries and Oceans ; 
that the Committee Senate Standing of the fisheries be authorized to study the Estimates expenditures of the Fisheries and Oceans domain in the Estimates of the Estimates for the year the ending the 31 March 2000 ; and 
that the Committee , the report to the more later the 31 March 2000 . 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
this question has has a very subject discussion to our committee of the Finance national the other day . 
, our notice , same if the appropriation of the government taken in a sense overall are claimants to the committee of the Finance national , nothing not from a other committee Standing of the Senate of the do refer the appropriation of the Department who interested this committee . 
the members of the committee of the Finance national the objectent to this that the mandate more overall be dilué of a way or of a other . 
I me summer of adjourn the debate for allow to my colleagues of there participate . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I I a question of the senator Murray regarding the of of the Estimates Main of the Estimates before the prorogation . 
he me seems that the positions budgétaies of the Department of the Fisheries have been studied by the committee of the fisheries to the over of the last session . 
I me ask if the senator Murray could explain this change apparent of Position . 
I understand that the Speaker has changed , but why this change of Position between the last session and the , session , particularly in words of this that was the committee of the fisheries and of the review of the budget of the Estimates of the Department of the Fisheries ? 
the committee wanted hear the evidence of the officials of the Department and of other on a question who the concern particularly . 
of more , I not think not that this is the first time that a part of the budget of the Estimates of a Department be working by a committee particular . 
in the other House , this is certainly and that they critically for the Budgets of the Estimates , if I not me read . 
I out the manner which we people the Estimates Supplementary of the Estimates ( A ) , for which some appropriation have been claimants to the committees abiding in reason of the practices of the other House . 
we we referred the appropriation to relates to the languages official and to the Library of the Parliament to the committees abiding competent . 
I apprécierais a response to this question . 
the senator Murray : 
honourable senators , I date of there answer . 
I I been chairman of this committee during a year or two he there has already a sure time , and I I resumed the Speaker to the over of this session . 
the used to the Senate to that . veterinary the Estimates Main of the Estimates and the Estimates Supplementary of the Estimates to the committee Senate Standing of the Finance national . 
since few years , because that of other committees Standing have know examine the forecasts budget for the departments which they the roles , we we decided of withdraw the forecasts budget of these departments opinions of the mandate of the committee Senate Standing of the Finance national . 
I I before my colleagues of this question to the committee the other day and they the are interestingly to this practice . 
they had two ; , if I not me read , and I can you say that of the senators expérimentés as the senators Cools , Bolduc and Doody were all to fact against this practice . 
their first reason , this is that the committee Senate Standing of the Finance national is the committee responsible of study the forecasts budget and he is therefore of refer these forecasts globalement to our committee . 
that said , they argue that nothing not from a other committee Standing of obtain the mandate of the Senate of the focus on the forecasts budget for a Department in particular . 
their second ground was that , if we we for learning that any study by a other committee Standing of the forecasts budget of the Department which he the ' must the do to the backs of the mandate of the committee Senate Standing of the Finance national , then this not would not possible . 
a time my motion agreed , same with several amendments , the committee Senate Standing of the agriculture and of the Forestry , by example , not could not about a study of the forecasts budget of the Department of the Agriculture . 
I think therefore that we not should not accept that a committee Standing be occurs in what that this be of study in full the forecasts budget of a Department in particular of the only fact that the forecasts budget have been renvoyées globalement to the committee Senate Standing of the Finance national . 
that could be different if we we take of the measures for this who is of approve the forecasts budget including . 
as the hon. senator the knows , this not is not the case . 
we do report on the forecasts budget with our points of view and our recommendations , but we not are not called to approve these forecasts budget in voting . 
the senator Robichaud : 
honourable senators , I like explain the reasons of the amendment that I move to the behalf of the chairman of the committee and of the members of the committee of the fisheries . 
when the senator Murray has proposed the adjournment of the debate on the motion , I not me am not rose since the senator Hays the has fact . 
but if I then , honourable senators , I like you say that the committee not to not create of precedent . 
during of the first session of the last Parliament , the committee of the fisheries had received a order of referred . 
you you rappellerez that a motion had been accepted to this effect . 
this is of , this that we we fact , and the Minister has met the committee to three occasions . 
he would in the interest of the Senate that this committee the before on these esteemed and questionne the Minister in the purpose of know how he the all these programs in application . 
in this report presented the year last , the seventeenth recommendation stipulait that the esteemed of the Estimates of the Department of the Fisheries and of the Oceans be référés to the committee of the fisheries . 
this report has been adopted the 16 June to the unanimously by this House . 
this is therefore on this report and on this motion , who have been adopted , that the basic the committee for continue the study of the budget of the Estimates of the Department of the Fisheries and of the Oceans . 
I you assure that he not is happened in the intention of the committee of the fisheries of empiéter on the mandate of a other committee . 
I believe firmly and do that our role would rather of you help , since if you you to consider the Budgets of all the departments , you not seen certainly not the time of do testify each of the ministers , their officials or counsel . 
the committee has a little more the time for study the budget since he the is of a only Department . 
we the we fact the year last . 
we we are well acquittés of this responsibility in acclaim the Minister . 
in showing our report and that a recommendation accepted to the unanimously , we want all simply continue in the same vein . 
the hon. Anne C . Cools : 
honourable senators , I like understand exactly this who the what here . 
more earlier , the senator Murray has said that he wanted adjourn the debate and speak more later . 
are - we in full debate or well the senator Murray the without he to propose finally the adjournment ? 
the the the Speaker : 
hon. senator Cools , we are now before of the motion of amendment of the hon. senator Robichaud . 
the senator Murray : 
honourable senators , I me apprêtais to propose the adjournment of the debate , but as that I I seen that of other senators want continue , I me am sitting well course for that the debate can the continue . 
the senator Cools : 
I think therefore that I should add few words to the debate . 
he me seems that few questions the pose to we . 
. could the geographic in two Each , the great and the small . 
the great question , as the has if well said the senator Murray , this is the mandate and the powers of the committee Standing Senate of the Finance national regarding the review of the budget of the Estimates , and that the right that has this committee the right of receive the entirety of this budget for the review . 
I believe that this that the senator Robichaud written in biggest , this is the right or the power of a committee of ask a mandate of the Senate for study some appropriation who the interested in the budget of the Estimates . 
we seek today today to the restore . 
the 4 March 99 , by the of the debate the the that , this is - to - say the 3 March , the senator Carstairs has proposed : 
that the Committee Senate Standing of the Finance national be authorized to study , to of in do report , the Estimates expenditures in the Estimates of the Estimates for the year financial the ending the 31 March 2000 , to the exception of the appropriation 1 , 5 and 10 of Fisheries and Oceans , of the credit 10 of the Parliament and of the credit 25 of the Council private . 
the senator Robichaud wish in fact réactiver this mandate . 
if the . up to the debate who has had place the 3 March , . see well that the senators Stewart and Comeau had indeed presented this ask . 
we must deal this question . 
, the obviously , this is the a or the other . 
a practice of the House of the Commons is subrepticement on the point of the favouring to the Senate . 
well that I seaway not of generates to this that , in some case , of the appropriation be submitted to the review of different committees , I not wish not that that become a practice Senate day and that each time that we are before of the budget of the Estimates , that the study of these appropriation be undertaken to the committees . 
that the said , I forward the response of the senator Comeau . 
is the question that we must manner . 
for the immediate , however , he the is of know if the committee of the senator Robichaud , the committee Senate the interesting to Fisheries and Oceans , can be indeed authorized to examine these appropriation . 
we able deal the other question certified . 
the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
the mandates of the committee are limpides . 
the only committee that the Rules allows to study the budget of the Estimates of a Department is the committee Senate Standing of the Finance national . 
he not is question of no other committee in this Rules . 
however , the Rules said that the committees can study of the questions in General . 
. there that , of the point of the government , a study general of the fisheries should clearly englober the study of the budget of the Estimates . 
except all the respect that I you must , he would can - be clarification this question and to a decision to this regard . 
that risk of we resulting of the problems . 
we we certainly had of the problems , the week last , when we we tried of refer a bill of bill to two committees squeeze . 
we we determined that this not was not the good way of do . 
he will can - be clarify the Rules . 
of fact , Honour the , you pays decide of refer the question to the committee of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure , if you préférez not not to this decision you - same . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I am all to fact of agreed with the comments of the senator Carstairs . 
I like add that - clause 86 the clear that this is to the committee Senate of the Finance national of study the accountable national and the Finance public . 
regarding the committee Senate of the fisheries , the Rules said : 
... ... ... on order of the Senate , the bills of bill , from , Petitions , interpellations , documents and other Contents regarding the fisheries in General . 
this is proprement the mandate of this committee . 
frankly , this is the role of the committee of the Finance national of study globalement the accountable financial of the country . 
he is all natural that of the committees are a interest for some departments to of the programs . 
also , he is logical of study the budget of this Department for know if the programs in question conforming or not the purpose of the bill regarding the Department in question . 
he is relevant for the committee of the fisheries of present a motion to of receive the order of the Senate for proceed to a study , if the - this includes in same time of the elements financial regarding this Department . 
the mandate over by the Rules to the committee of the Finance national is completely different . 
in this who respect the studies stipulates a interest national , he there has always a question financial , and he would important of not not deals to the committees the possible of the study . 
the the the Speaker : 
hon. senator Murray , you you already taken the speak . 
you - you the intention of propose your motion and of adjourn the debate ? 
the senator Murray : 
your the , if you are prepared to to a decision or to say that you will take the question in advisement , let - we that . 
the the the Speaker : 
I like , if you the let , do a comment . 
the practice has been of refer the Estimates of the Estimates to some committees . 
I believe that we the we already fact to the over of this session in the case of the languages official . 
the budget of the Library of the Parliament has also been referred to a committee . 
when I was member of committees , he would often , if I me recall well , that a committee who wanted see the mandate expanded ask that . him veterinary the budget of the Estimates . 
that him give any penalty of examine this that he wanted in the Department , without other referred of the share of the Senate . 
this not is can - be not a good practice , but I know that . there has had point by the past . 
the senators can in this case one this that they want to the about of the Department . 
the practice current allows only to the committees of examine the questions who their are renvoyées . 
the way of proceed is a question that only the Senate can deal . 
however , he there a precedent . 
the senator Carstairs : 
your the , we could can - be deal this question of the way next : we could ask to the senator Robichaud of withdraw his motion of amendment ; we could then adopt the motion to to refer the budget of the Estimates to the committee of the Finance national ; then we could ask the leave of to to the motions , this who would to the senator Robichaud of propose that the budget of the Estimates of Fisheries and Oceans be examined by the committee of the fisheries . 
this by , we not affaiblirions not the mandate of the committee national of the Finance , but we acquiesce to the committee of the fisheries the power of study the budget of the Estimates of Fisheries and Oceans . 
I not know not if this is that a way of the an of the dilemma , but this could well in be a . 
the senator Murray : 
honourable senators , I not see not why we not could not act of the so . 
the hon. Eymard G . Corbin : 
honourable senators , I will look a senior of Decision in the twofold . 
the committee of the Affairs foreign has also a interest in this question and I move the adjournment of the debate .

the Day national of commémoration 
the tenth anniversary of the tragedy of the École polytechnique 
the hon. Joyce Fairbairn : 
honourable senators , in me by here today today , I was very sad to the of that he there has ten years already , 14 young women étudiantes of the École polytechnique of the University of Montreal have been driving by a young issue armé to the over of a after - afternoon well plain . 
honourable colleagues , I am particularly sad to the of that despite the had and the disgust that this tragedy has occur , the broader publicity who in has been made and the education of the public to this about , the violence against the women and the children continues of at to the country and , to the world . 
, the least 51p. per of all the women Canadian of more of 16 years have fact the experience of to the least a incident of this that the Code criminal define as of the violence physical or sexual , and the abuse them are close de10p. per of all the crimes of violence to the country . 
we we progressé to the over of the ten last years , through to good number of advocates adversaries , of the two sides of the Senate , and I think particularly to of the women as her the senator Sheila Finestone , former - Minister of the Condition " . 
we we also fact of the progress through to a number of more in more great of colleagues and of friends masculins who the are engaged to support the fight against the violence . 
we we amended the laws . 
the campaigns of education the continue and which profit of this day national of commémoration . 
however , honourable senators , I believe that we not we not still succeeded to reduce of way serious the intolerance , the poverty , the lack of believe of itself and of understanding human who used of home of incubation to the violence . 
they have been persons because that this was of the women and , fact still more unplanned home him , because that he the saw as of the féministes . 
, the over of the years , I I seconded of the women commeSuzanne é - Edward , the same of a of the young victims , Anne - Marie ; Heidi Rathjen , étudiante and friend of good number of the daughters driving ; and Wendy Cukier , who has contributed to the implementation on at of the Coalition for the control of the weapons . 
of many colleagues of the House from of all the parties have worked to this matter important . 
this was a enormous croisade public which the success the mesurera in last analysis when the attitudes changeront and that the statistics will régressé . 
he there will of the progress when the cellule é to the within of our society and the system who the support find a way of inculquer to the children of the values harm on the kindness and the generosity and not on a further of War and of violence human and on the acquiescement muet according which the difficulty who is fact behind of the doors closes not must not preoccupied a country . 
I like say to Suzanne é - Edward and to all the other members of the families who have a daughter or a sister which we commémorons today today the remember that we narrow well on the seaway of the success in évoquant the memory of the their . 
we not can there happen that in finding the resources , the practices and the alliances between men and women of our society who will of reduce the haine , the frustration and the fear . 
honourable senators , we are many too lents to we in with . 
we must certainly to the memory of the 14 young daughters who sending in peace to Montreal since 1989 and to the thousands of other victims of our society of increase the effort Special who will of accomplish this work as now . 
the hon. Erminie J . Cohen : 
honourable senators , I rise today today to the opportunity of the Day national of commémoration and of action against the violence made to the women . 
this is today today the tenth anniversary of the killing of Montreal . 
the 6 December 99 has been a time essential in the history of the Canada . 
this prosecutors carnage who has took 20 minutes is considered as the worse killing known made in a only day and he has been the day the more dark of our history . 
this crime of haine has attention the attention on the victims of the violence governed against the women in as that such , this who the numbers . 
the killing has shown to the women and to the men that the violence against the women is a énigme well real and threatening to the within of a society who the enorgueillit of be civilisée and linked . 
the Canadians not are more in legislation of argue that of the crimes of haine of this kind not the produced that home our neighbours of the south . 
unfortunately , the violence against the women continues of be a reality to the Canada . 
of the épouses , of the mothers , of the daughters , of the kindred and of the her are breached , agressées and assassinées all the days . 
this is also a fact that the authors of these crimes are generally of the men . 
this are of the maris , of the spouse , of the neighbours and of the best friends . 
the status social or the situation economic any little . 
the men and the women must the rise against this situation disgraceful . 
these young women who had any their life to live needing many better that that . 
today today , we must not only we remind of they and of the other victims of violence , but also we Engage to new to to a term to this terrible ridding . 
the 6 December 99 deserves a reflection national on a outbreak who tragedy still our society . 
in all the country , of the ceremonies have place for honour the 14 young women who have seen and their life écourtée . 
not forget that this is our responsibility to all in the society of eliminate all the types of violence across . 
honourable senators , the violence is a problem of society which we must all we deal , that he the whether of the violence racist , of the violence é , of the violence made to the children , of the violence against the women and against the members of minorities Parliamentarians or the gais and lesbiennes . 
a new phenomenon is wished : the violence in the over of school . 
she is very widespread to the time current and she is completely unacceptable in a society civil . 
this is a serious problem that all the Canadians must help to eliminate . 
the hon. Shirley Maheu : 
honourable senators , I wishes take the speak today today for out the sad and famous tenth anniversary of the tragedy of the École polytechnique of Montreal . 
we we souviendrons that the 6 December 1989,14 young women have lost the life to the hands of a man who not had that a purpose : killing of the women . 
the act of haine has one all the Canadians and has changed the way which many of between we meddling the violence against the women . 
this is for this reason that each year since 1991 , we we memories of this tragedy . 
this is also for this reason that the 6 December has been appropriately as the Day national of commémoration and of action against the violence governed against the women . 
this killing we has fact take conscience that several Canadians were victims of violence and that a such situation was unacceptable . 
of many measures have been taken to of refute this problem , but he rest still many to do . 
I wishes also say to the parents and friends of Barbara Daigneault , Natalie Croteau , Hélène Colgan , Sonia Pelletier , Anne - Marie Lemay , celebrating St. - Arnault , Geneviève Bergeron , Maud Haviernick , Michèle Richard , celebrating Turcotte , Maryse Leclair , Anne - Marie Edward , Maryse Laganière and Barbara Marie Klueznick Widajewicz that those - this not will never studiously and that we take the ways necessary for that of such events not the occur more .

the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , today today in the tenth anniversary of the death of the 14 women assassinées to the École polytechnique of Montreal , the 6 December 1989 . 
I know that I me am the the - speak of all the senators when I states that we not forget not this tragedy and that we compatissons with the families and the friends of these women , and with all the other people who have been marquées by this tragedy . 
this sad anniversary must we give to reflect . 
I like you remind the comments held by the hon. Royce Frith le1er February 1990 , and indicated in the Hansard of this day - that , when he has attention the attention of the Senate on the violence made to the women in the society Canadian . 
we continue to work for the Elimination of the violence made to the women . 
I applaud to the efforts of several groups who have high the conscience overall and who have worked for obtain of the changes . 
I applaud to the efforts of my friends parliamentarians who have worked in view of eliminate the violence made to the women by the Adopted of the Act on the control of the weapons to fire , the Elimination of the Defence of intoxication volunteer in the framework of the crimes violent , the strengthening of the provisions of the Code criminal provisions to the Offenders to risk high and to well of other ways . 
the senator Frith had reason of the ask the he not the was not of a act haphazard isolated , but rather of the symptoms of a problem social more deep . 
the been of the names des14 women to the statue of the every of the 6 December 1989 to Montreal yesterday being the importance of the question . 
the letters gravées in the steel and the - are conçues of such way that he must do a effort for déchiffrer the names . 
this not is not accidentel . 
the every has been and thought for that the names of these women the day in our conscience and that their history not be never overlooked . 
, this step of our history , I you urge , honourable senators , to reflect to the events of the 6 December 1989 and to do this that you can for that we we and , in the legislation where we not the we not , that we we efforcions of have a society where Sidney the respect and the harmony between the men and the women . 
the hon. Marisa Ferretti Ferretti : 
honourable senators , the of Montreal , you can understand how the remember of this event fulfilling my soul of sadness . 
the 6 December will gravé in the memory of the Canadians since this is in this day that we commémorons together , in the more great sadness , the death tragic of 14 young women who have lost the life to the the of a act of violence nonsense . 
, the opportunity of the tenth anniversary of the tragedy of the École polytechnique of Montreal , I you urge not only to condemn the violence , of where that she come , what that be the origin , I you urge also to reflect on the causes of a act also Tisserant who has as secoué our society Canadian and Quebec . 
I am sure that the 14 victims of the École polytechnique , which we love today today the memory , we inviteraient to lead of the actions more takes who are change the over of the things . 
, as of example , we must stop of we quereller to comments of the Act on the control of the weapons to fire , because the fusil Mini - 14 used he there has 10 years not is always not , by the bill . 
this weapon to fire not will can - be not déclarée illégale before the 1 January 2002 . 
we not can not bring to the life the 14 victims of the École polytechnique . 
the worse inequity , if we there réfléchissons well , is the Warsaw by those who the believe abandoned by the society . 
in memory of all the victims of actions criminals , seek to find a solution to the causes of the poverty , seek to inevitable the pain and the only , who are the more often the enemies sources of the violence .

I draw also the attention of the Senate on a other tragedy very sad who the is has to this date - this . 
today today in the four - ninety - second anniversary of the an of Halifax . 
same if this an not seemed not directly be linked to the War , this is because that . had need of equipment of War that . has made to the port of Halifax of the products who have changed tragiquement the life of a very great number of our fellow , this day - that . 
the facts surrounding the an are well known . 
the ship belge Imo and the ship French Les Blanc , who death of the no , are wars in collision in the port .

statistics Canada 
the data of census - - origin ethnic " Canadian " - - effect on the opportunities of marketing 
the hon. Lorna Milne : 
honourable senators , on a about completely different and many more léger , I I learned recently of the Opposition and of the period of the questions to read the newspapers of the morning many more carefully . 
this that I I discovered he there has a week me based a statement rather that a question , and a statement of indignation . 
of after the National Financial , a debate is in over to Statistics Canada on the question of know the he must allow to the polled to the questionnaire of the census of of the says " Canadian " to the Order of the origin ethnic . 
this privilege we has been " rather to against - heart for the first time in 1991 . 
in 1996 , the good sense the had fashioned to Statistics Canada , and " Canadian " Role among the examples of origin ethnic . 
I i that many of between we are in the same case that me and not can not define their origins Parliamentarians by a only word . 
as the most of the people which the family is established to the Canada since more of a generation not can revendiquer a simple origin ethnic , I I need of assistance of the share of my colleagues senators . 
I refuses of accept the phrase " bâtarde " . 
my background of the side paternel are , by order alphabétique , German , English , écossais and irlandais and that a lady always vaguement her who was probably her . 
of the other side , my mother is of 389 " think " British . 
not forget not that he must hear by 389 think British a good mixture of Pictes and of Celtes , 300 years of occupation Roman - this who ask probably the chevelure has and the Grits olivâtre of my mother - without speak of the waves successives of Angles , of Jutes , of Saxons , of Viking in maraude and of Normands conquérants . 
two of my grandchildren - children have of the ancestors European who are came in America of the North to the beginning of the XVIIe century . 
wavered generations of this family are valour and have up on our mainland . 
who therefore are we ? 
of the liver haché ? 
how must - we we describe we - same ? 
I believe that we are of proud Canadians of origins abiding characteristically Canadian . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the senator Milne : 
I states that I am a CIBC typical and Statistics Canada should have shame of same consider to choose the benefits of the marketing to the backs of the freedom of choice who allows to the Canadians of the describe as they the want . 
what shame !

question PERIOD PERIOD 
the Defence national 
the Timor oriental - - of of the helicopters Sea King 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
the a of them has should - well involontairement , I poured - do a amerrissage forced and a other has known of other ennuis . 
the Minister can - he we say if these two aircraft are to new , particularly the who has been forced of amerrir ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I like all of first to tribute to the jurisdiction of the members of the crew of the helicopter . 
they have should do opposite to a problem Operational , be the RRSP of amerrissage to the broad of the coasts of the Timor oriental . 
fortunately , they have succeeded the RRSP in any security . 
after a implementation to the point dissent of a approximately of minutes , they have could décoller and the to to good port . 
the helicopter Sea King , as the hon. senator the knows without doubt , has been designed of way to power , if necessary , the question also easily on the water that on land . 
he is being for his stability during of this kind of RRSP . 
I not broaden not until to say that this amerrissage has been wanted . 
he the was well course of a reaction to a problem dissent , but the situation has been maîtrisée to the perfect by the crew . 
the apparatus was designed for do opposite to this kind of incident , and the all has been corrected relatively quickly , the the of the circumstances . 
the senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I not like not one this that said the Minister , because that could be embarrassant . 
the Sea King not is not for to operate on the water . 
he fleet , but all to the more . 
I not Chronicle not necessarily of question on the of of operating . 
these aircraft not voleraient not the they not were not in of of operate and the they not were not pilotés by of the people very competent and very conscientious . 
can - be not I - I not been enough clear in asking my question . 
the Minister can - he me say if this Sea King - that is in of of operate . 
if this is the case , will he power continue his mission ? 
the second Sea King has he known of the problems operational or of Availability during the stay to the Timor oriental ? 
in particular , the apparatus who has made a amerrissage forced can he steal of new ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , according the information that I I , when the helicopter has amerri , of the ships have immediately been forwarded of the HMCS Protecteur . 
the crew of the apparatus has in fact redémarré the drives after about 10 minutes , the helicopter has décollé and the is then asked to the airport of Dili . 
a team of technical has then been sent to the airport for , according the information that I I , determine , the case if , the reference of the damage or the need of proceed to of the upkeep . 
as this is the case in this kind of incident of flight , a inquiry on the security of the prohibit has been business . 
for the time , I not am not in legislation of give to the senator the results of this inquiry or of him say if she is always in over . 
the justice 
the possible of amend the Code criminal relatively to the harassment criminal - - influence of the bill of bill S - 6 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I believe understand that a colleague of the Leader of the government , to know her the Minister of the Justice , has concern publicly the intention of see to this that of the changes be made to the Code criminal relatively to the harassment criminal . 
of this side - this of the Senate , we are puzzling of know what are the policy and the intention of the government to this regard . 
more specifically , the Leader can - he confirm that the Minister of the Justice incorporera in the bill of bill first the provisions of the bill of bill S - 6 , a bill of bill which the interest many , including , the senator Oliver ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I not I not of details precise for the moment . 
I am sure that her the Minister of the Justice is to the fact of the bill of bill of the senator Oliver . 
as to the nature exactly of the bill of bill that she will to the Parliament , I prefer expect until to this time - that . 
I speak can - be provide then more of details . 
the transport 
the regulatory of a requires monopoly in the sector of the transportation Air of travellers - - policy government 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , my question to the Leader of the government to the Senate respect the policy government to the regard of the monopoly who threat of the dramatically in the sector Canadian of the transportation Air of travellers . 
the Minister of the Transport seems say that he hope and the that a or several other businesses with in time timely the join to the sector and create of the competition . 
between - time , he am to regulate more strictly the sector and it hear that the government will always the power of act in case of price predatory . 
this that I want know , to the further , this is where in is the policy government . 
this not is surely not the last word . 
I not like not more that anyone the regulatory , but we properly in a situation where he there will virtually a monopoly in this sector for a period indéfinie . 
in consequential , he will hurts regulate of new the sector . 
the business not can not be Cabinet to withdraw of the services , to the grateful , or to draw his price as she the does . 
who said monopoly said new regulatory . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate can - he we give the insurance that the question of know the he must reréglementer the new monopoly not has not been factual and that the government will this responsibility to the seriously and that he not will not evidence of complaisance in would a policy low as the Mr. Collenette has proposed to the over of the interview that he has given recently to the media ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
I believe , honourable senators , that the commitment of the government relatively to the questions raised by the senator has been expressed clear by the Minister and repeatedly by me in this chamber . 
nothing not has still been decided . 
as the senator the knows , in few days , the shareholders of the a of the carriers Threat from to the vote on the offer who their has been Before . 
I am therefore to me deal for the time , because that could be considered as a statement influant on this decision . 
however , I then say that the Minister has statement very clear the five objectives of the policy of the government , to know the protection of the consumers against the price exorbitant , the keeping of the services to the small communities , the protection of the rights and of the concerns of the employees , the keeping of the competition and , course , the control Canadian work . 
the government and the Minister of the Transport are profoundly to apply these principles . 
for the time , he rest of the points to deal in the sector private , but these principles not changeront not . 
they remain the key of voûte of the policy government in this sector . 
the senator Murray : 
I thank the Leader of the government for his response and the order of the conditions contained by the colleague , Mr. Collenette . 
I believe that the people of Air Canada have taken knowledge of a array of report - after a identifies and can - be the is - he of a report informal - of a committee of the House of the Commons who formula some recommendations as to the regime that the government should to in place . 
the chairman of Air Canada said to the government and to the Parliament this that he is prepared to accept . 
I am struck by the much between the attitude intransigeante of Air Canada , who we said this that she acceptance and this that she not acceptance not , and the attitude rather docile and passive of the Minister of the Transport . 
what that he in be , we see in time and place . 
the senator Boudreau : 
when the . has asked to the Minister what measures the government 7.6 for ensure the respect of the objectives of the policy and who would respect this policy , he has answered wording that the parliamentarians , the Board of the competition , the Board of the transport of the Canada , the Minister of the Transport and that the Governor in board joueraient a role . 
, this step - this , the committee of the Senate and the of the House of the Commons have all two examined the question . 
I am am that they have fact a excellent work and that the Minister will seriously the of their findings . 
he not fact no doubt that the chairman of Air Canada want express his opinions and I am am that the Minister in will the also . 
however , the decisions Strategy and the structure final will service of the principles that I I situations to the intention of the honourable senators . 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the government to the Senate is - he in are of say that he is possible that the government witness to to a industry air réglementée to the Canada ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , for the moment , the process following the over . 
the sector private must take of the decisions very serious , and I think that we should expect that these decisions be taken . 
they the will under little , and we not should not speak or attempt of influer of someone way that this be on the decisions that cognizant of the special acted their rights to as of shareholders . 
I am very prudent to this about . 
however , for the moment , the government has statement the principles worry on which the support any policy who will RFP . 
, my notice , this is to the Minister of the Transport that he will , to a date later , of determine exactly how these principles will the in application . 
the v. of the operations of the company air InterCanadien - - service to the small communities 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , the Minister continues of repeat the five principles out by the colleague , the Minister of the Transport , the a of them the the service to the small communities . 
the v. of the operations of InterCanadien has had of the impact on of small communities of the region of where the hon. senator is placed . 
the Minister can - he say to the Senate how of Airports of the Canada Atlantic we desservis only by InterCanadien not are more desservis now ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the senator of his question . 
I I consulted quickly my notes , but if I me recall well , he is question of three Airports . 
the senator Kinsella : 
the Leader can - he the appoint ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
he there in has two to the New - Brunswick , that the hon. senator knows surely very well , and a to Newfoundland - Newfoundland . 
the senator Kinsella : 
our colleague , the hon. senator Cochrane , has underlined the other day that the airport of Stephenville and two Airports of the North - is of the New - Brunswick were of the number . 
the people of Stephenville and of the North - is of the New - Brunswick not the she not in the spirit of the government ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
I believe understand that to the time current all the communities of the Canada Atlantic , to the exception of these three communities , are expressed by a other transporteur . 
these three communities , be Stephenville , to Newfoundland - Newfoundland , and Charlo and Chatham , to the New - Brunswick , are expressed by Air Scotia to from of Bathurst . 
as to Stephenville , his people must been the to to the centre of Deer Lake , located to about 113 kilometres of their community . 
still that , this not is not the ideal , but hope that this will " . 
I must attention that the service of transportation Air to Stephenville possession of the problems before same the events recent . 
the senator Forrestall : 
that say of Sydney ? 
the regulatory of a requires monopoly in the sector of the transportation Air of the travellers - - policy government 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I I a last question supplementary that I like question in the purpose of do the point and the light on this question . 
the Minister can - he ensure to the Senate that the government not tolérera not a monopoly not réglementé in the sector of the transportation Air of the travellers ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
I then say to the honourable senators that the government plan the interests that has clear situations the Minister of the Transport in his policy . 
the trade international 
the failure of the discussions to the Organization World of the trade - - grants agricultural of the States members - - assistance to the farmers Canadian . 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , the given that the negotiations of the WTO have failed in end of week and that , of any obviously , the question of the agriculture concern greatly some senators , I remind that the Minister of the Agriculture , the Leader of the government to the Senate , of other ministers and the Prime Minister have all said that , for help the farmers Canadian , he was absolutely eliminate the grants excessive that compensate the Americans and particularly the Europeans to their farmers . 
he seems now that this objective not will not reached before long . 
what is the Position of alternative of the government for help the farmers and how will he refute the grants excessive who exist in the systems European and American ? 
he appear that he not that now not of strategy for come in assistance to the farmers of the Western . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , he is clear for all the world that the results obtained to U.S. in this who respect the question of the grants not are not access and that the matter not has not progressé as we the had hoped . 
however , he would false of conclude that the discussions have taken end . 
the discussions in view of eliminate or of refute the grants awarded by the States - United and the Union European the continue under the under of the WTO . 
we hope that the matter will advance and , in fact , he remains a priority primordiale for the Minister and for the government . 
the senator Andreychuck : 
honourable senators , I conçois that the negotiations be a priority . 
they the are since 1947 . 
this that I find difficult to accept , this is that . the him to this that they produced a result who we would for of see the light to the across of the tunnel , and this , for the first time depuis5 or 10 years . 
this not is clear not the case . 
same if the negotiations the continue , a solution satisfactorily not come not before a across of time . 
that will the government for help the farmers of the Saskatchewan to the light of the fact that the negotiations of the WTO have clearly been brought to more later ? 
the government réexaminera he the programs of assistance and of support to the farmers of the Western today today ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I said that these discussions the will under the under of the WTO . 
the Minister and our government continue of there give the priority that they deserve . 
I say also to the senator that , to the over of discussions that we we face , the Minister me has said that the negotiations on the renewal of the programs spouse federal - provincial of security of the income the will and , hope - the , of a way who will the farmers Canadian . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , is - this that . raise some questions in dangling in this who has relates to the transportation ? 
is - this that . chair the question of the costs of transportation for the farmers of the west of the Canada ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
, this at - this , I not can not make the substance of the discussions in over between the governments federal and provincial . 
I could can - be obtain these information and , if possible , the share with the senator . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
I like have these information not wrote , because I believe understand that he there has had of the discussions with the companies rail for limit the profits , if I can use this term , or the surplus that they which of the transportation of the Wheat and of the other products agricultural . 
I like a response written on any the policy of the transport to the Canada . 
the senator Boudreau : 
I me undertake to provide the response written the more detailed possible . 
response regarding to a question orale 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I I the response regarding to a question that the hon. senator Spivak has raised the 17 November 99 to the Senate to the about of the regulatory of the products of équarrissage . 
the health 
the regulatory of the products of équarrissage - - policy of the government 
( response to the question raised by the hon. Mira Spivak the 17 November 99 ) 
the government federal has the powers required for regulate the membership of the products équarris and the industry of the équarrissage . 
in fact , all the Contents grasses and all the tourteaux of protein for to be used in of the foods of the animals are unregulated under the regime of the Act Current to the foods of the cattle . 
the products équarris must be ensure to the standards determined in the Rules on the foods of the cattle and not can forecast of contaminants who would harmful to the animals or menaceraient the specifications of the foods . 
the institutions of équarrissage are the subject of a inspection Annual who allows of whether the they held the registres taken , apply the measures of control required for avoid the contamination fork and étiquettent properly their products . 
of the parties of animals hers abattus are since of many years transformées for be ajoutées to of the foods of the cattle as sources of protein of high quality . 
in April 1996 , the Organization World of the health has recommended that all the country prohibit that of the meat and of the farine of routine of ruminants be data to eat to of the ruminants . 
: includes the tested , the moutons and the chèvres , by example . 
these measures the enrolled in the framework of the efforts to to eliminate all the factors of risk known associated to the transmission of the encéphalopathie spongiforme of the tested ( ESB ) or " illness of the cow Mad " . 
in 1996 , the Canada has led of extensive consultation of the industries affected who have given place to the tax of the shut Current to the foods of the cattle in August 1997 . 
since the taken of effect of the shut , the farmers not can more use of " Contents interdites " as ingrédients in the foods of the ruminants . 
however , the farmers can still use these Contents in the foods of the animals not ruminants as the volaille and the porc . 
if the Canada has decided of exempt the porc and the volaille of the shut of give of the protein mammaliennes to eat to of the ruminants , this is that no encéphalopathie spongiforme transmissible ( RESOLVED ) of origin natural not has been pressing home the porc or the volaille . 
in addition , the use continues of these products in the foods of the productions and of the volaille pools the need of the incinérer or of the enfouir . 
for ensure the regulatory get of the products of équarrissage , the ACIA has undertaken a review of the policy to this regard . 
the business of the Senate

I thank the hon. senator Corbin of have raised the question to the Senate , because the question of the comments who are made to the Senate or to the other place to the about the a of the other and still to the about of the Governor General is important .

the most of the regarding are flatteuses . 
I must therefore to as decision that the term " minion " not is not offensive in his means general . 
he must however , I the said , do evidence of the more great judgment for avoid all the words offensants to the place of other people or of institutions important to the Canada .

that he be given to the Committee Senate Standing which will referred the bill of bill C - 6 the education next : 
that he has the power of scinder the bill of bill C - 6 , Act to to facilitate and to promote the trade Ministerial in perpetuate the information personal collected , used or releases in some circumstances , in providing the use of ways electronic for to or put of the information and of the transactions and in amend the Act on the evidence to the Canada , the Act on the Statutory regulatory and the Act on the review of the laws , in two bills of bill , the Prime the set of the part 1 and of the Printed 1 with of the 1993 and a clause of into in into and the second the set of the rest of the bill of bill and of the annexes 2 and 3 with of the 1993 ; that the deliberations on the second bill of bill can be delayed until after the study of the Prime ; that the a or the other of the bills of bill can do the subject of a report to the Senate managed after have been examined ; and that , regardless of the biodegradable accustomed , the Senate give this education not any when after have been before of the bill of bill , same after that the committee will began the study . 
honourable senators , he there has few days , while that we discutions in this chamber of the evolution of the bill of bill C - 6 to the Senate , I I taken some commitments to the behalf of the loyal Opposition of Majesty Majesty . 
I the I fact with the approval of the leadership of this side - this . 
the commitments were essentially that , the he there had a clause of the committee for amending this bill of bill to of take in consideration the concerns expressed , including in the sector of the care of health , we , of our side , would all this that we could , in the legislation of the reasonable , for do adopt in the more brief will a bill of bill amended to that he can be examined by the members before that they not ajournent the House of the Commons for the break of ë . 
I rise now for confirm this commitment . 
however , this commitment is a problem for the motion . 
if I soumettais this motion to a debate and to a vote requires , that could have for effect of delay the Adopted of a bill of bill amended in this chamber and of so to the commitment that I I taken more earlier . 
I like therefore simply say that I not I not the intention of proceed and . 
I will now do few remarks on the question and let hear that , when I will debated , a colleague want can - be simply adjourn the debate . 
this is a question important that I I raised . 
this bill of bill combine in fact two bills of bill separate . 
I had someone share , and I the I can - be always if I can the on , of the quotations of the Minister of the Justice and of officials of the Department of the Industry who affirm that he there had to the departure two bills of bill who have been combined in a only . 
I had the intention of do of these quotations to the comte the . 
unfortunately , honourable senators , you someday me believe on speak , because that among all the suffice that I I in with , I not find not the statements made by Ms McLellan and by the officials of the Department of the Industry before the committee of the House of the Commons during of the review of the bill of bill C - 54 . 
Ms McLellan has should very clear that , without would book of the Unauthorized of the cabinet , Mr. Manley and she had indeed wanted of first present two bills of bill different , but that in reason of the calendar Parliamentary , they had decided of the combiner in a only . 
a lady of the behalf of Stéphanie Perrin , of the Department of the Industry , who has appeared before the committee of the House of the Commons , and that before the of the Senate he there has little of time , the has confirmed without the Shadows of a doubt . 
when the officials of the Department of the Industry have before before the committee Senate , I their I asked the question , but I not I not from of response clear . 
they want well course protect their arrières . 
they have underlined that the bill of bill was part credited of the framework legislative government with the trade Ministerial . 
they have through the fact that the provisions of the bill of bill on the life privacy will beyond - beyond of the trade Ministerial . 
they the apply to the information personal collected in the framework of activities trade , that this be by seaway Ministerial or other . 
the fact is that the part 1 is a bill of bill in itself . 
honourable senators , I I had few reserves to the about of my motion when a sure Ian Lawson has appeared before the committee . 
this is a lawyer of Vancouver and a expert recognized of the questions regarding the information personal . 
Mr. . Lawson has up the argument that , constitutionnellement , the part 1 of the bill of bill depends of the part 2 . I not you dérangerai not with this or , of any way I not think not the have here . 
I you ask a time of more of me believe on speak . 
as you the know , Mr. Tassé , who is a former under - Minister of the Justice , is also a constitutionnaliste . 
he not is not waited of say that the argument Mr. Lawson has been réfuté Mr. Tassé . 
he we has explained of way detailed and scholarly , as to the usual , why the together of the bill of bill and all his provisions are a year legitimate and appropriate of the power of the government federal in the of trade . 
I return to this that I I during of the second Reading . 
he the is in fact of two bills of bill and not of a only . 
. not can not do enter this bill of bill in the category of the bills of bill omnibus because that he contains certainly more of a principle . 
we have then a debate in second Reading , a study in committee , a debate in third Reading and we could all go each home we . 
I recognize that this is a démonstration by the absurd , but I hope that she you allows of understand the risk that there a such practice . 
other said , . will to the any of the rights of the Parliament in him soumettant a bill of bill made a principle clear statement of such so that the parliamentarians so discuss of his provisions to the light of this principle . 
of a point of view practice , to the step of the second Reading , I I expressed the fear that , in the present debate , we accordions many of attention to the part 1 , on the protection of the life privacy , that we jugeons more cause , and not enough to the parties on the trade Ministerial , on the ability of the citizens of to with the agencies of the government federal by of the ways electronic and on the effects of the Act on the evidence to the Canada on the use of the Communications electronic by the system judicial . 
this are that of the questions extremely serious , but the committee of the House of the Commons not the has virtually not scrutinized , not more that our own committee . 
honourable senators , he enough of read the third report of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology , tabled more earlier today today , for see this who the is past . 
the report said then : " - committee not has not received enough of evidence on the parties 2 to 5 of the bill of bill for do of the comments to comments of the provisions that they fight " . 
the committee said however that he appear ceased a support enough broad to the regard of these parties of the bill of bill . 
well well , honourable senators , if , in few months or few years , he appert that the provisions of the parties 2à 5 were of the problems that human not has repérés or some , then the members of the government and of the Parliament will the air of very fools when the people closely , in rétrospective , the path of this bill of bill to the cabinet and during all the process legislative . 
honourable senators , same if I it into my motion for the reasons that I I contained , I wish to this that my colleagues understand to what point the senators of this side - this taking the question to the seriously . 
we believe that he must do all in our power for one the government when he , a bill of bill who is in fact two bills of bill , as this is the case here , simply for accommoder those who pertinent the business to the other place . 
this are the members of the Opposition of the other place who would should object with into if that had escaped to the attention of their colleagues . 
but that , this is a other history who out still a time the importance of the Senate as House of second review of the decisions of the power executive . 
( on the motion of the senator Kirby , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the Act on the stopped judicial 
bill of bill Amend - Report of the committee - Adjourned of the debate 
the Senate what to the study of the second report of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional ( bill of bill C - 7 , Act amend the Act on the stopped judicial and a other bill in consequential , with proposals of amendment ) , presented to the Senate the 30 November 99 . 
the hon. Lorna Milne : 
honourable senators , in as that chairman of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , I I the honour of to the report on the bill of bill C - 7 , Act amend the Act on the stopped judicial and a other bill in consequential . 
the bill of bill move a sure number of changes to the procedure of preventative the in the Act on the stopped judicial . 
he for including a exception to the rule general of not - disclosure of the issues of the people who have from a preventative to the regard of a offence the to the regulations to of allow their communication in the framework of the review of the for to a employment who put these people in situation of confidence or of authority by report to of the children or to of the people vulnerable . 
the bill of bill is referred with of the proposals of amendment . 
before of explain these proposals of amendment , however , I wish to you provide a sure historic of the facts . 
in June last , the Solicitor General has appeared before the committee for do the promotion of the bill of bill then called C - 69 . 
all to the long of this sitting and of those who have followed , he is became clear for your committee that the bill of bill such that some omissions several gaps . 
, the behalf of the committee , I I wrote to the Solicitor General for him do share of our concerns , to know , including , that we were drastically of see that he not there had no referred deliberately to the fact that the bill of bill is the issues of the offenders sexual réhabilités . 
that we inquiétait , in addition , that some elements internal of the bill of bill be whom in the regulation citation the bill of bill . 
during our deliberations , we we also discussed acrimonieusement of the elements of policy who under - tend the bill of bill and we we are asked if we apporterions a change basic to the system of preventative , aspect who had been defended by several of our predecessors to the House . 
I I also raised this question in the letter that I I reply to the Solicitor General . 
I not am never to credit the deserves of a something to the human to which he up and I must you attention , honourable senators , that the work of the committee has been greatly facility by the cooperation of the Solicitor General . 
not only has he answered quickly to our letter , but him - same and his officials have the the of all our concerns and have prepared of the suggestions of amendments on - the - face . 
as we not had not the time of to these changes to the opportunity of the session before , of the officials of the office of the Solicitor General have appeared before our committee the week last to of discuss of new of the bill of bill and of present to the committee of the proposals of amendments to the bill of bill who purpose to his concerns . 
, the behalf of the committee , I thank the Solicitor General and his officials of the attention that they have granted to our concerns and of the assistance that they have made in proposing of the improvements to the bill of bill . 
the report regarding the bill of bill includes the major amendments following . 
first , the regarding of the words " children " and " people vulnerable " just of the regulation to the body of the text of the bill of bill . 
the committee has noted that the term " disability " not is more acceptable in the society of today today . 
he not between more in the practice of use this term in a legislation legislative . 
second , the word " body " has been added to the clause 6 of the bill of bill to that he be well clear that only the offences them would conducted in under of the system proposed . 
third , the Printed of the offences them has been withdrawn of the regulation and insérée in the bill of bill proprement said . 
honourable senators , this not is certainly not the first , or the last time , that we apportons of the improvements to a legislation legislative from of the other place . 
the changes that your committee has Regional to the bill of bill C - 7 have for of all to a exception clear , close and limited to the Act on the stopped judicial . 
these changes have used the balance between the objectives of the system of preventative and the need of protect the children and of other groups vulnerable in the society . 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I support certainly the comments of the senator Milne . 
I commend the members of the committee of the excellent work that they have fact in their review of the bill of bill . 
I support the amendments . 
I wish however to attention two issues of concern . 
the changes that the . move of to to the Act on the stopped judicial in this who respect the preventative are the first intrusion important on a point where the public " clear that the preventative , a time granted , interdisait any use later of the former stopped judicial of a human against she . 
I me remind that , when I was young lawyer , he has was a sure time for that the public parvienne to understand in what was really the preventative . 
I must however express some concern regarding the integrity of the process of preventative . 
all to the long of the hearing , the Minister and the officials the are eulogizing very aware that this legislation constitute a intrusion in the system of preventative and that she walked can - be of fall or of undermine all the process of preventative . 
they have however should that the service of police who would in for of the system utiliserait of the mechanisms of control effective . 
well that I my the more great respect for the services of police to the Canada , he responsibility to the government of ensure a review systematic and effective of the process of control of the police . 
recently , by report to the Act election , . we has guaranteed that the protection of the information personal would unabated . 
yet , by inadvertent , all the issues of the semiconductors of the Manitoba have been égarés . 
he would unacceptable that the system of preventative not retained not the integrity . 
he would inconceivable of not not do a review thorough and of not not maintain the system of indicators . 
. not must use the - this that for whether the casiers court of people conducts in of the offences of nature sexual . 
this who me concern , this is that the systems the détériorent with the time . 
when they will to short of resources , the responsible of this system cognizant can - be of the raccourcis may of in threaten the integrity . 
a time that . will provided this kind of entorses to the rules regarding the preventative , will . trend to be of other reservations to of other for ? 
the objective described in the here is very commendable , but he should the act of a case because , and no other bill of bill similar not should be presented . 
Ms Patty Bowen , Director administrative of the body Bénévoles Canada , has before before the committee of the Affairs legal during of the last session . 
she has said that this who was the more important , this was that , of the notice of Bénévoles Canada and to the light of research Conducted , the review of for was different of a audit of stopped judicial . 
according she , the audit of the casiers court has a ( limited , because the majority of the individuals who will we of bad treatment to a child or to a other human not have never been recognized guilty of a crime . 
they not listed therefore not in the system of casiers court . 
these last years , we we had trend to adopt of the bills of bill who are believe parent to the people that the difficulty against which we we of struggle has decreased . 
the representatives of Bénévoles Canada and of many other witnesses who have appeared before the committee have said that the problem just of the selection of the candidates , not of the checks of casiers court . 
few are the individuals who infligent of bad treatment to of the children or who are to the research of a employment where they will the opportunity of we of bad treatment to of the children and who have already a stopped judicial . 
they have acted of way détournée and have , until to now , escaped to the system of justice criminal . 
in pareils case , a audit of the stopped judicial not is hardly useful . 
I the on the fact that the government , in his this bill of bill , ups to this that he protects the children . 
I wish to to tribute to Bénévoles Canada for the process of selection , and that has of other groups as Scouts Canada , who working with of the young and the is fresher of a process of selection useful . 
the children will protected in the legislation where the process of selection will followed . 
these two comments the made , I support the bill of bill and amended . 
however , I déconseille to the government of speak in the process of preventative . 
I attention also to the government that this bill of bill not handcuff surely not the children of be molestés by those who at a employment where of the children could be vulnerable . 
I believe that the government and the Canadians have the responsibility of be always on the who - subject in this who respect the children and that this bill of bill not is that a tool among as of other to their clause .

the hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck : 
honourable senators , he there has more of 200 years , a great movement of émancipation has had place to the within of the as British and of the States - United of America who has for to the black - men , women and children - of be physiquement libérés of the chaînes of the slavery . 
yet , in this era enlightened , the black are still considered of after the colour of their peau . 
honourable senators , we we fact many of progress since the time of the slavery . 
my ancestors were of the esclaves . 
today today , we greatest in a country democratic where of many opportunities the may to we . 
the Act on the rights of the human of gravity has fact many for this who is of help the members of the minorities visible to from party of the benefits and of all this that this great country to offer , but , in as that country , we we however of the problems to stay represented . 
I I recommended that together , we committing our efforts to that the people not be more considered of after the colour of their peau , but of after this that they have in the heart . 
we were supposed live in some will although exclusively to the members of the minorities visible . 
the Act on the rights of the human has changed all that . 
we we fact of great progress and he rest many to do , but I am of agreed with those who say that the Canada is the country of the world where he fact the better live . 
the process of peace to the Libya 
the hon. LoisM. Wilson : 
honourable senators , to the over of the nine the months , he there has had of important developments in the War civil to the Libya . 
the conflict between the North and the south not has not taken end and the number of barils of Oil products the is increased since the end of the business of implementation in place of the pipeline between the South - Libya and Port - Saïd , in the North . 
the community international , there including the Canada , has administration of the appropriation for fund a modest Secretary composed of four people and based to the Kenya , under the under of the Authority governmental for the development , or IGAD . 
this initiative African , which the mandate is of negotiate a plan of peace , has the support of the International Partners Forum , which fact part the Canada . 
the 26 October 99 , the Department Canadian of the Affairs foreign has announced two appointments - the my , to as of sent Special in the framework of the process of peace to the Libya , and the of John Harker , to as of counsel Special on the questions African . 
the two duties are supplementary but continue of the objectives different , pursuant to the policy public of the Canada to the regard of the Libya . 
my mission contra to revigorer the process of peace to the outcome of extensive consultation with of NGOs and of academic Canadian , of members of the community soudanaise to the Canada and of representatives of country brothers who Whelans their support to the process of off , and that of the government and of the Opposition they of the Libya .

the Position of the Canada is nothing of least that the implementation in implement of a plan of peace overall and controlled . 
the work government to revigorer the process of country based on the long term because he not there not of solution miracle . 
the policy Canadian is little more complex that his existing American in this that she fact place to a dialogue drove with the sector private Canadian . 
the he more that the mining oil exacerbe the conflict to the Libya or give place to of the abuses of the rights of the man , then he will arisen of to in implement of the restrictions to the trade or all other instrument to clause . 
only a action quick in favour of a peace equitable to the Libya will to the people soudanaise of from party of this resources natural . 
this is this who ask that the Canada that by to these two appointments supplementary and that he seems current to a allure more measured that the seat of the south , by example , for deal these questions épineuses .

Robert Peterson not is by the Prime homosexuel to be such to as of méchanceté in our streets , and he not will not the last not more - to least that the society Canadian not take Position and not timely his subject disapproved . 
this not is that in Sidney this type of fanatisme and of discrimination that we commencerons to in see the end . 
in as that Jewish , this act unmitigated of haine me consterne . 
we have should from of the lessons of the tersely of the Holocaust on this that fact the haine to a human , to a family , to a community or to a country . 
I find this type of racism and of discrimination sad . 
he is appalled that of the people ignorants continue of judge their neighbours in service of their race , of their religion or of their direction sexual .

in or the " on these actions , . allows to the people of the there thoughts . 
we not must not be satisfied of we . 
the type of cowardly peel by the agresseur of Robert Peterson is deep and empreint of haine and of fanatisme . 
Mr. . Peterson plans now of leave the University of the New - Brunswick and the region of Fredericton .

the honourable senators not are not without know that the trade bilateral between our two country represents now more of 1.3 billion of $ by day and not has of grossir . 
the trade bilateral has quadruplé to the over of the last decade . 
unfortunately , . fact opposite to of the embouteillages , to of the problems of saturation and of congestion to the states frontaliers . 
of the expectations long and prevalence are offered . 
I believe that he there has three levels of government , and that of the authorities private and to the least 17 agencies government of the two sides of the border who law of a way or of a other our positions boundaries . 
we not can that note a lack of leadership for this who is of rénover this roadblocks eliminates to the efficiency commercial who obstrue our couloirs frontaliers all the days . 
with the arrived of the concept of the " fair to time " in the practices of Destruction and the given that the any of the products " fair to time " the a expansion incredible to because of Internet , this cancer that is the saturation not will that the nationally all the days and the expand . 
the result , this is that the productivity and the competitiveness of the Canada continue of in needless . 
until to now , he not there has had no plan of together for which to this situation obvious , to this deteriorating of the conditions . 
rather that the these do evidence of leadership policy , we let the various frustrating avoid the problem , be inefficient and worse , the thoughts to of the war of jurisdiction .

our colleagues American have been IT to the problem . 
the Congress just of approve of the investment massive in the infrastructure safety including . 
by against , the authorities Canadian not have not " the same priority to these investment . 
the leaders , the ministers and the " must the meet for develop a plan common for solve this problem eliminates . 
honourable senators , this not is that when we joindrons the may to the speak that we deviendrons a nation trading also well to the soil that in the airs . 
. can hope that the new millennium réveillera our governments responsible and the incitera to assume their responsibilities in the interest of all the Canadians .

what kind of message does . by that to the Canadians of across to the country , when the capital blond creating who live the Parliament of the country continues of adhérer to the vestiges of the unilinguisme ?

he not would certainly not very involved for the government of the Ontario of declare the region of Ottawa region bilingual , in the aftermath of the other recommendations domain in the magnificent report tabled Mr. Glen Shortliffe . 
honourable senators , this is well more that a question regional , this is well more that a question provincial . 
this is a question of pride national . 
the Canada role a role links on the scene international . 
Ottawa her regularly the leaders of state of the world world . 
Ottawa is the seat of the " , of their teams who are , between other , the links diplomatic and commercial of their country respectif with the Canada . 
Ottawa is the seat of the Parliament of the Canada , of the service public federal , where all the parliamentarians and all the officials can choose of work in English or in French . 
honourable senators , I you ask of well would you join to me for urge the government of the Ontario to well reflect to the consequences of his actions and to restore in the bill of bill of restructuring who is to the study the concept of a capital bilingual of the Canada , the new city of Ottawa .

he would realistic that Ottawa be the capital national and that the . there about that a only of the two languages official , and that the Canadians French and other francophones not so say that Ottawa is also their capital . 
I not in say not more for the time because the debate will long , but I will on the about .

the work 
the situation criticism of the without - homeless - - of of Progress of the strategy government 
the hon. M. Robertson : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate and the on the strategy of the government to to unconventional the situation of the without - homeless . 
in fact , my question fact the to a response provided by the hon. Leader of the government to a question raised by the senator Cohen , the 23 November last . 
, the end of the Winter last , the government has responsible the Minister of the Labour of coordinating the solution that the government has proposed to the problem of the without - homeless . 
, this time , the situation looking high . 
. had expressed of many concern , because well of the people had suffered to the over of the Winter . 
her the Minister had then said that she élaborerait the strategy of the government in least of a months . 
honourable senators , this who me concern , the given the time expired , this is the possible that this strategy the enlise someone share to the government . 
this is of , this that it hear a clause The yesterday in the Toronto Star , that the Leader has surely read . 
. quote a source government who would said this who following : 
we not we could thoughts the marchandise . 
human not the in pleased . 
the Minister has worked very and we can say that we we fact of the things , but we not we not could to speak . 
I not like not me proud only to this clause . 
the Leader of the government could can - be to of the Particulars regarding the response that he has given to the senator Cohen he there has a 15 , inform the Senate of the of of Progress of the strategy regarding the without - homeless and explain on what he the suggested in saying that of the measures would announcements under little . 
used here , the expression " under little " is always strangely élastique . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the Minister responsible has fact a work remarkable in the by in all the regions of the country for consult the people and meet the groups directly in because . 
she has covered well of the ground and has presented very assiduously of the were of principle and of the programs in favour of the without - homeless . 
I then ensure to the hon. senator that this process not the is not enlisé . 
the Minister the case with expeditiously and vigour to the implementation in implement of his recommendations . 
in this who respect the date exactly of the announcements , to new I must say that he will to the Minister of in decide . 
however , I sharing the hope of the senator and I the well that the announcement not tardera not too . 
the senator Robertson : 
honourable senators , I thank the Leader of the government of this response . 
this who me bothers , this is that the government has should prematurely that a strategy would in into since nice lurette . 
that has created of the expectations who have terni a little the good intentions of the government and who have décontenancé all those who want the deal to this serious problem . 
according the same clause of the Toronto Star , the Minister of the Finance would said that , for give of good results , the strategy must be accepted by the three levels of governments . 
well of the honourable senators , which the Leader of the government and me - same , have already participated to the negotiating of agreements federal - provincial . 
we know to what point of such negotiations can be difficult and long , then who knows to what time we obtiendrons a strategy on the without - homeless ? 
seen that he must now that the provinces and the municipalities the while , the process could take two or three years . 
between - time , well of the people suffering . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate could - he we say if the negotiations with the provinces have in and what is the Mr. ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the other levels of government have far responsibility of we help to and this challenge of size who the there across to the country . 
he is clear that they have a role to play . 
all program présentépar the government federal not replace not the responsibilities who , morally and constitutionnellement , are to the governments provincial and , by procuration , to the authorities municipal . 
I bring the questions of the hon. senator to her the Minister and I will of my better for to with the more of information possible . 
the senator Robertson : 
honourable senators , this who concern of many Canadians , between other things , this is that to the time where the announcement has been made the Winter last , he not has not been question of the participation of the provinces or of the municipalities . 
he seems that the government federal not has not played the role of Leader of leadership , as he the had promised . 
this is disturbing , and I like obtain of the answers clear and assign , to of power answer of manner preventing to the people who ministerial continually with my office . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I understand , say , the forward that the senator country to the regard of this question . 
I then only him give the insurance that her the Minister the interest of very close to the matter and that she continues of the do current . 
, the risk of me repeat , I will thoughts any the information that he me is possible of to to the hon. senator to of already some of his concern .

the business of the Senate 
point to the Rules 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , if I in had had the time during the period of the questions , I would asked a question to the chairman of the committee Senate Standing of the Banking and of the trade . 
the senator in question not is not present , but I see the chairman - chairman and several members of the committee of the Banking . 
today today , the senator Hervieux - Hervieux has presented a report of the committee of the Banking who has been read and tabled . 
I am went the examine and he not had not been certifié as report of the committee by the chairman of the committee Senate Standing of the Banking and of the trade . 
the table to the office me have informed that they the had also noticed and had referred the report to the senator Hervieux - Hervieux to that she the sign . 
the chairman - chairman of the committee Senate Standing of the Banking and of the trade can - he we describe the nature of the meeting during of which he has been decided - if however that has been decided - that the committee of the Banking étudierait the bill of bill S - 3 clause by clause ? 
there he a the the of this meeting ? 
a motion has she been introduced and there he a the the of this motion , Requesting to the chairman or to the chairman - chairman of present this report to the Senate ? 
the hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , the response is yes . 
the senator Kinsella : 
the chairman - chairman can - he explain why a other senator that the chairman or the chairman - chairman , as the want the used and the use , has been appropriately for present the report to the Senate ? 
the senator Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , I not am not the senator Kolber . 
I not know not to what he has thought . 
yesterday , my office has received a message me Requesting of present the report on the bill of bill , but I was party of Saskatoon for Ottawa and , as you the know , the trip the any a day . 
by therefore , I not I not answered to this ask . 
the first time that I I heard say that the report would presented today today , this is when the hon. senator Hervieux - Hervieux the has mentioned . 
the senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , to the page 14 of a publication of the Branch of the committees of the Senate dated of November 99 and entitled Introduction to the committees Senate , . ask how the reports must be sent to the Senate by a committee . 
. there said that , when the chairman of a committee , a report , the committee unless that he has debated the business that the Senate him had similar in the mandate . 
in the case of a bill of bill , that includes the study clause by clause of the bill of bill . 
the use to that the . ask to the sin of the committee when the report on the bill of bill will presented . 
a member of the committee , then a motion to this about . 
in would the motion , the committee give to the chairman the leave of present the report . 
according this publication , the report is presented by the chairman or by a other member appropriately of the committee . 
in the absence of the chairman and of the chairman - chairman , I like determine the process who has been followed for that a other member of the committee be and appropriately . 
he must ensure the control of the process for know if yes or not the report of a committee is in fact the report on which the majority of the members of the committee the are heard . 
this is a of the problems that I I with the report who has been tabled in this chamber more earlier to the over of the deliberations . 
the other problem that I I is that I not know not to the fair - because that I not I not still the the the - this that His the has said to the time of the Presented of this report . 
I believe that I I heard that the leave had been granted , but I know if that was referring to the deliberations who have had place here today today or to the decision who has been taken he there has someone time when the bill of bill has been referred to the committee of the Banking . 
. the asked to the time the he was referred to a committee or two committees . 
we must obtain of the clarification on these two questions . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I like answer to this order to the regulation . 
I I listened the senator Kinsella . 
I know to the fair the he the concern of three questions or of a question . 
he has all of first raised the question of the signing necessary on the bill of bill , and I believe understand that he the is view after have examined the bill of bill that he not was no signing . 
if I not me read , this situation has been corrigée since that . has discovered this mistake . 
the second question is to know if the bill of bill has been well examined by the committee . 
I believe understand , to the light of the intervention of the senator Tkachuk that , to the notice , a motion to the referred of the bill of bill has been agreed . 
the third question is of know if . has well appropriately a member of the committee responsible of table the bill of bill , be the chairman , who not is not here and not could in do report , the chairman - chairman or a other member of the committee , in fact , the sponsor of the bill of bill , the senator Hervieux - Hervieux . 
I not know not if that will to the any of the decency or of the procedures normal , but I pretend that not . A member of the committee can table a report to the place of the chairman , when the chairman - chairman is present , same if . the is normally to this that the chairman - chairman whether in the absence of the chairman . 
in this who respect the words of the chairman to the the of the Tabled of the report , I will the repeat . 
. me in has sent a copy . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
you are well the only . 
the senator Hays : 
. there Athens : 
pursuant to the order Special proposed with the leave of the Senate and adopted the 24 November and notwithstanding the ) 97 ( 4 ) of the Rules , the bill of bill is now referred to the Committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign . 
I the I received in concerning to the Senate . 
I believe understand that that was to do in so that this legislation legislative be matter of way orderly , according the désirs of the Senate . 
I trying of see to this that the bill of bill be examined to the time by the committee of the Banking and by the of the Affairs foreign in reason of the questions who have been raised by the senators relatively to the details of the bill of bill . 
I not me pause however not on this question . 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , the question is of know if the . can allow to a member of the committee of table a report without the Authorized of the committee , if this is well the case , then that this report is approved by the committee . 
the committee has decided of do report of the bill of bill . 
that I far , human not has seen the bill of report , can - be same not the chairman or the chairman - chairman . 
by included of the decency and by respect for their position , he would was to the least that they grab the report or in allow the disclosure . 
except mistake , this not was not the case , and her the senator Hervieux - Hervieux not has not been formally Cabinet to table the report . 
I ask confirmation of these facts . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
not , that not the is not fact . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
second , I not want not that we we enlisions in the procedure and I hope that we not considerations not here a precedent in term the bill of bill to more of a committee , but I not see not how the Speaker can be authorized to refer of a committee to a other , to the step of the Affairs offered , a report who not has same not been debated here . 
I not see not the link that the Speaker can do . 
that . me takes if I me wrong , but I supposais , after the two days of debate spent to this question , that the report would tabled here and that the Senate déciderait of the fate . 
he the is of a report for to the Senate and not to the Speaker . 
I know this that . does by " order Special " . 
. note , in transcript the debate , that he is said simply , as the senator Hays the has explained the second day in rectifiant of the comments who not had not been properly transcrits in the the the official , that the question was be referred to a place , then to the other . 
the proposition was that , for go of a place to the other , he him was be reconfirmé here . 
the Speaker has acted in our behalf , without explanation or warning . 
I I always thought that , to the across of the the , this was the Senate who décidait how he was deal the bills of bill and the reports and where they were go . 
in this case - this , however , same if we want that the report strictly to the committee of the Affairs foreign , that the is fact without that the Senate that the word to say . 
the Senate not has never had the opportunity of examine the report or of see this that he there had no . 
the senator Hays : 
I like present a other observation to the about of the point to the Rules , and more particularly of the concern position by the senator Lynch - Lynch , to know if the bill of bill was to here before of be referred to the committee of the Affairs foreign or go to the committee of the Affairs foreign after that the committee of the Banking in after last with him . 
I not I not the or exactly before me , but I believe that the Speaker had interpretation that as that say that he would of first to the committee of the Banking then that , a time that the committee of the Banking in would last with him , he would to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
we not we nothing said of more , and he is reasonable of interpret that as that say that he would directly to the committee of the Affairs foreign a time that the committee of the Banking in would last with him . 
he is also possible of interpret that to the way of the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
of any manner , I believe know that the committee of the Affairs foreign not has not began his deliberations . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch to - he add someone something as to the desire that the question be now heard to the Senate rather that to the committee of the Affairs foreign ? 
the senator Tkachuk : 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I i that we us of a point to the Rules , and all the world can take the speak regarding a point to the Rules . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
I not I not had the opportunity of ask to the senator MLA , who as me is member of the committee steering of the committee of the Banking , the he knew that the senator Hervieux - Hervieux had tabled the report to the House today today . 
the the the Speaker : 
I am sorry , but the question to the senator MLA not is not valid for the time . 
however , the he to there answer and if the Senate to well the hear , he not in the that to him . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
he would can - be useful that I ask the reason of my approach . 
the senator Kinsella has raised a point interesting . 
I not am here that since six years , but I I been chairman of the committee of the Finance during a sure time , while that the senator Kirby was chairman of the committee of the Banking . 
if I not could not table a report , I told , in as that chairman , to the senator Ban Ban of the do to my place . 
when we not could or the a or the other be here , we namely a other arrangement . 
this is the same something with the senator Kirby . 
or well he Economy the report , or well he me asked of the do to his place . 
if we not had could the do or the a or the other , we we would heard on the human to finding for this do - if need was . 
the senator Kirby and me - same not had not of committee steering . 
we resolve to we two the committee steering , and we we in tirions very well . 
I me ask if the senator MLA the knew . 
is who we would of understand how he the fact that that the be happened without that I in far nothing or not there appose my signing . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I not was not to the Chair , but I believe know that we are now before of two points to the regulation . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
they the ramènent to a only . 
your the has decided during of the Affairs offered - time where the . not can or point the Rules or raise a part of discussion without in have from the leave - of send to a other committee a report of committee who had all fair of be tabled . 
the Rules for that to the least a day must the allowed between the Tabled of a report and the third Reading . 
in this case - this , of any obviously , we not could not to to the third Reading , but we not we same not could see the report . 
I had hoped that , if Honour the was to a decision , you the seen fact during of the order of the day , which case we have could then receive a explanation regarding this decision exceptional . 
in way , this not is not we who we created this situation . 
in second place , the senator Hervieux - Hervieux not to not been formally Cabinet by the committee to present the report , the report has he indeed been presented in good and properly form ? 
the senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , this order to the Rules there several elements . 
regarding the analysis of the bill of bill by the committee of the Banking , the review clause by clause and the report to the Senate , I I been until to the table for consult the report tabled . 
a report the there people indeed , but he not was not the signing of the senator who the had presented , this who has has in me a interrogation , to know what was the been to follow . 
the report not has been tabled or by the chairman or by the chairman - chairman . 
, least that the trial - refer of the business of the committee not refers that a other senator has been responsible of the present - and I not the I not under the " - , I not know too if the report has been tabled to the Senate in good and properly form or not . 
the other question , who is unusual , and all the world in agree , the to the fact that , by order of the Senate , the report must be sent to two committees rather that to a only . 
the decision of the do examine by the committee of the Banking the expliquait by a series of concerns raised to the step of the second Reading and who concernaient of the questions tax , this who 1 all to fact to the skills of the committee of the Banking . 
we should study the report of the committee of the Banking before of refer the bill of bill to the committee of the Affairs foreign because that he is possible that he there that a link between the problems of tax that has internally the committee of the Banking and the questions related to the Affairs foreign - including , the questions provisions to the rights of the human who have fact part of the points internally to the step of the second Reading . 
all these questions should be examined . 
honourable senators , he is possible that we were of way a little premature . 
a report only has been tabled . 
we not the we not examined . 
he there , to my notice , a link substantial between the analysis of the report and the analysis of the bill of bill , who would then referred to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
this is this who me has country to me question on the acceptability of the question . 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , I I already said this that I thought of the acceptability of the work made by the committee of the Banking and the question being by the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
however , I find the argument of the senator Kinsella very interesting . 
for this who is of the day - I not so not to back the with on the the the of the deliberations of this day - that - of the members of the two committees have some the desire of the look on the question , particularly in reason of the nature of the bill of bill and of a of the elements of the bill of bill who has relates to the rights of the human . 
we we tried of do in so that the bill of bill be referred to two committees successivement . 
the committee of the Banking the would focused on the Prime bill of bill . 
the words that we we used then were in tomorrow of : . 
the question is the next : that fact the Senate or how with he the happened of the work of the committee ? 
my interpretation of the statements to this about and of all the things that we we made until here , on the fact that the report not that not been signed and on the question of know the he is consistent to the Rules or not that a member of the committee other that the chairman or the chairman - chairman , a report without a motion enable - and I say that that not is not a barrier - this is that we want that the bill of bill be referred to two committees and that the reports of the two committees we headed for be studied in same time . 
if that is fact , the senator Kinsella not will more place of the concern . 
rétrospectivement , I say that the suggestions of the hon. senator were can - be the manner appropriately of proceed - this is - to - say that we not have can - be not should refer the bill of bill to the two committees the a after the other . 
however , since we we by and , this who so is exactly this that we we do for , to the result know , to know have before we the work of the two committees to of power the examine . 
however , for do that , we must have the two reports before we in same time . 
the the the Speaker : 
there has he someone other hon. senator who wish take the speak to the about of the order to the Rules ? 
if , I will take the question in advisement . 
I not was not here the week last when the question has been raised for the first time and I not I not heard all the arguments . 
however , I like remind to the senators that when a bill of bill is referred to a committee , this last must do a report . 
no amendment and no motion not are tabled to this time . 
he not there has not of discussion . 
this is the situation who prevails to the time current . 
however , I will me look on the question and I you in rendrai the as that possible . 
order orders OF 
the business of the Senate 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :

then that before the governments were which as the major washrooms and choose of information personal , of our days , the sector private role a role of more in more important in this area . 
since the Commission of networks as Internet , the disclosure and the distribution of the information personal is become a source of concern for the Canadians who are of see their life privacy the rétrécir to legislation that these networks the extends . 
, the Canada , the government federal and the most of the governments provincial have already of the laws who deal of the Clinic , of the use and of the disclosure of information personal by the sector private , but only the Quebec has any a bill on the protection of the information personal who act the sector private . 
some organizations have adopted of the codifies Voluntary relatively to the Clinic and to the use of the information personal , but the use of these codifies not is not widespread and not is not brutes of a coast to the other . 
in 1996 , the government federal the is committed to develop a bill for protect the information personal collected by the sector private . 
the objective of the government was then of legislation before the beginning of the year 2000 . 
the bill of bill C - 6 result of this commitment . 
a bill of bill who is to protect the information personal must necessarily to the of the right of a human of know and of accept that of the information to the about will collected , used or released to some for . 
the bill of bill C - 6 is the balance between of the objectives conflictuels , to know , of a share , this right of a human of increase to provide of the information and of understand why of the information are collected and how they will used and , of other share , the need of ensure a operating doing and efficient of the economy . 
honourable senators , to the exception of the only amendment proposed in the report of the committee , I can you ensure that the study of the bill of bill C - 6 in committee has shown that he the is of a legislation legislative remarkable . 
the government has happened a real Leader - of implement on the trade Ministerial . 
the bill of bill proving this difficult balance between the world of the Affairs and the interests of the consumers . 
one , honourable senators , I not I never seen a bill of bill that the businesses that the groups of consumers are all as impatients of see adopted . 
all the representatives of businesses , of consumers , of firmes technological , of companies of insurance , of Banking , and same of assessment of the credit , who have before before the committee have calling the Adopted quick of the bill of bill . 
all these stakeholders suitable that he represents a together fair and reasonable of practices of information . 
in effect , of the witnesses of all the sectors of the economy Canadian , to the exception of the sector of the health , have employee of the long as " balance delicate " , " result of years and of months of negotiating " , " very good consensus " , and cetera , for describe this bill of bill and ask the Adopted with haste . 
the witnesses who have adopted this point of view understood not only of the representatives of the sector of the businesses , but also , by example , of the advocates of the rights civilians and of the experts in protection of the information personal . 
by therefore , honourable senators , if this bill of bill is also good that I just of the say , why the committee there has he proposed a amendment ? 
this is to this question that I believe duty spend the major part of my comments . 
this is because that , in despite of the support massive of the businesses and of the consumers , a sector very important the against to the unanimously to the Adopted , for the moment . 
short , a sector , the of the health , is all as unanimous in the Opposition to the bill of bill . 
he is clear that the together of the sector of the health not was not part of the admirable consensus which I I spoke he there has a moment . 
in effect , same to the within of this sector , he not there has absolutely no consensus on this that should be the good solution , in this sense that he not the is not presented as a group homogène who réclamait a together precise of amendments . 
he has calling all they of amendments . 
let - me of you give few examples for illustrate the situation . 
some witnesses have recommended that the information on the health be completely excluded of the bill of bill . 
of other , as the the - speak of the Association medical Canadian and of the Association dental Canadian , thought that the bill of bill not protégeait not enough the information personal on the health . 
of other the unleashing if the provisions provisions to the consent were expertise since they not parlaient not specifically of consentements informed and real . 
all the members of the sector of the health who have before before the committee had of the doubts as to the scope and to the application of the bill of bill . 
the concerns that I I made schématiquement , honourable senators , come of as very various , by example of the doctors , of the dentists , of the pharmaciens , of the nurses , of the hospitals , of the Laboratories medical , the as of the research medical , the departments provincial of the Health , the responsible of the accreditation of the services of health , and cetera . 
, say true , honourable senators , no of the groups of the community of the health who have appeared before the committee or him have fact , a memory not was favourable to the Adopted of the bill of bill in his form current . 
the committee has also been contravenes by the testimony of many representatives of the sector of the health who have said not not have played a role seriously in the consultation who have preceded the Tabled of the bill of bill . 
some of between them have same said to the committee that they had release with the responsible government he not there has hardly that eight or nine months , and that they the were fact answer that he not there had not place of the concern of this bill of bill because that he was in fact on the trade Ministerial and not on the sector of the health . 
by therefore , honourable senators , the consensus if admirable that the Minister has succeeded to initiative in very little of time in the rest of the economy , be about 18 months , not predecessor not the sector of the health because that the bill of bill was to on the trade Ministerial . 
he the obviously that . not has not thought on the the to include the sector of the health among those who were play a role essential in the negotiations . 
of many services of health are to the for of the state , but the people and the organizations who the fournissent excursions can as to the sector private , to the sector public or still to the sector of the they . 
he there therefore of the links many more ties between sector public and sector private that this not is the case in someone other area of the economy Canadian . 
however , honourable senators , the sector of the care of health am many to take the bill of bill such that he is . 
in fact , the Minister of the Industry has seconded implicitement this reaching when he has appeared before the committee of the Affairs Social , Thursday last , to comments of the application of the bill of bill C - 6 to the information on the health and has said that , in the three years following the into in into of the bill of bill , the impact on the sector of the care of health would limited . 
he has supported that this impact would so limited that she not sort happened of delay the application of this bill of bill for clarify the impact on the sector of the care of health . 
honourable senators , the members of the committee have including the arguments of the Minister , have including the facts on which they were based , and in are yet upon to a conclusion completely different . 
the committee continues of fear that this bill of bill of trade Ministerial not that of the effects high obscurs and unforeseen ; more important still , the committee would particularly know the nature likely of these effects high . 
in effect , the impact likely of the bill of bill on the sector of the care of health is far of be clear . 
the he is true , as the has fact point the Minister , that the bill of bill not will of the impact that on a intake part of the sector of the care of health in the three first years following his Recognition , he is therefore possible , during a sure time , of clarify the effects that he will on the information particularly exposure and personal on the health of the people , without exploring his impact on the broader sector commercial who rest . 
since , with this amendment , the bill of bill not will of the impact on the sector public of the care of health that three years after the into in into , we giving to the government and to the parties appointed the possible of develop of the rules and of the regulations who garantiront to the Canadians that the information personal on their health will treated properly by the stakeholders of the community of the health . 
honourable senators , the the of this possible and of the fact that all the other sectors of the economy Canadian were unanimous to wish that the bill of bill be adopted quickly , the committee the is then asked the he there had a way of give satisfaction to those who souhaitaient a Adopted quick of the bill of bill , all in imply to the reserves expressed by the sector of the care of health . 
the committee has rejected to the unanimously the idea of exempt fully to the application of the bill of bill on the protection of the information personal the sector of the care of health , as the have proposed some witnesses . 
he has however felt timely of be a brief period to of determine the he is possible of happen to a consensus on the changes to to to the bill of bill for to his impact on the sector of the care of health them and field . 
Thursday last , we we heard different witnesses representative the sector of the care of health . 
of any obviously , they the are concertés before of come testify , because they have all proposed exactly the same amendment ; they have all proposed of expect five years before of opt the sector of the care of health to the provisions of the bill of bill . 
the the of the importance capital of the information personal in the of health and of the need that these the be protected by the bill on the protection of the information personal , the committee believe that five years , this is well too long . 
we we deliberation rather for a deadline of a year after the Recognition , or of two years to be of the day where the bill of bill receives the Assent Royal . 
the Minister has already said that the bill not will proclaimed that a year after have received the Assent Royal , of so that our proposal is that the deadline be of two years after the Assent Royal or of a year after the Recognition . 
, our notice , a deadline of two years should be sufficient for allow to the parties interested of the sector of the health and to the officials of the departments of the Health and of the Industry of in happen to a consensus on the changes to to to the bill of bill for that he push effectively on the sector of the health and for concerning a good part of the uncertainty who the surrounding now . 
we believe also , honourable senators , that the structure of our amendment , a important advantage on the plan of the negotiating . 
in effect , we propose , in this amendment , that if , two years after the Assent Royal or a year after the Recognition , no consensus not the is administration and that no amendment not that been introduced , the bill of bill such that wording one in into in the sector of the health . 
by therefore , honourable senators , we believe that this legislation incentive modérément the sector of the health to in happen to a consensus to of avoid all the problems which he said the concern . 
the fact of impose a date limit to which the bill of bill go in into to least that a consensus not be reached would a way very effective . 
I must say , honourable senators , that the committee has fact a work remarkable in a very short laps of time . 
we we had many of p.m. of hearings . 
we we entendu25 witnesses , this who is to little close the half of the people who had asked to the departure to be heard . 
in the the days of the hearings , of other people the are made in Requesting to be heard . 
he is therefore became obvious for the committee that , if we take find a solution acceptable to the problem of the sector of the health in bearing the bill of bill to the Senate until to this that a solution négociée can be appropriately , he would many of time . 
if we had chosen this seaway , the bill of bill not become not bill and he not the apply not to all the other sectors of the economy Canadian who the wish . 
by therefore , we we felt that the something logical to do was of not not delay the application of the bill to all the sectors of the economy who wish that the bill of bill be adopted , but of in delay the application to a only sector and during a year only after the Recognition . 
this are that , honourable senators , the grounds of the report . 
if you want a analysis more detailed of the evidence heard by the committee , who , to my notice , will in the sense of the findings of the committee I you veterinary to the second part of the report of the committee , who has been tabled to the Senate yesterday . 
I urge the honourable senators to read this part of the report . 
I the said , we feel that a postponement of a year after the Recognition , be two years after the Assent Royal , will the held of negotiations very pointues between the departments of the Health and of the Industry and the sector of the health . 
in ending , honourable senators , I like also speak of the Act on the protection of the information personal . 
he has underlined that he there had of the vertical unambiguous between the bill Bill C - 6 and the Act on the protection of the information personal . 
by example , according the Act on the protection of the information personal , . can the address to the Court federal only in the case where the access to of the issues has been refused . 
the complaints regarding the Clinic , the use or the communication of information by a institution government not can do the subject of a referred before the Court federal . 
yet , to the words of the bill of bill C - 6 , the complaints regarding the Clinic , the use or the communication of information by the sector private can do the subject of a call before the Court federal . 
honourable senators , in as that parliamentarians , he will without say that we must impose to the institutions government and to the institutions private the same requirements in the of protection of the life privacy . 
the committee in is come to the conclusion that , if the bill of bill C - 6 Year in into , he would to to day the Act on the protection of the information personal for that the institutions government and the institutions private be to the least covered to the same requirements in the of protection of the information personal . 
always on this question , honourable senators , if the bill of bill advocating a program of education of the public by the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy and if the Bill bill C - 6 is of new responsibilities and widening substantially the mandate of the High to the protection of the life privacy , he will of itself , still a time , that a part inherent of the report of the committee recommends of money of the resources further to the High to the protection of the life privacy for that he the constitutes of the mandate expanded . 
in ending , honourable senators , I attention that the committee has tried of establish a balance such that the application of this bill of bill to the broader majority of the economy Canadian - or to the more great number of sectors economic - the would without delay and that , for a period very brief , say a year after the Recognition of the bill of bill , this application not toucherait not the sector of the care of health in the hope that , in the 24 months subséquents , we could happen to a solution négociée regarding this bill of bill . 
is , honourable senators , in what context the at the bill of bill . 
the amendment has been adopted to the unanimously to the committee . 
no senator not has some of opinion dissidente regarding the amendment proposed . 
by therefore , honourable senators , I you urge to adopt the report of the committee . 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
the hon. senator would - he of answer to a question ? 
the senator Kirby : 
yes . 
the senator Oliver : 
you you said all to the long of your intervention that he not there had that a sector who not was not the subject of a consensus and that this was the sector of the care of health . 
you you also said that a part of the response résidait in the fact that he is designed as a bill of bill on the trade Ministerial and not on the care of health . 
that is - this who is went of across and what lesson can from the Senate of this process ? 
how can - . the ensure that that not the happen not ? 
we hostility that a bill of bill and we the throw to the other House . 
that is - this who is went of across during this process ? 
the senator Kirby : 
I not can that surfacing of the assumptions on that . 
your question is excellent . 
you flavour that we we are muscle on the substance of the bill of bill and on the reaction that she raises home the people , the given the little of time which we horses and our desire of complete quickly our study . 
this that I me without to say is nothing of various citations of evidence rather that of a conclusion detailed . 
first , the bill of bill has all of first been a bill of bill on the trade Ministerial and on the protection of the information personal in the trade Ministerial . 
when . think to the trade Ministerial , . not think not immediately to the sector of the care of health to the Canada , because he is subventionné by the state . 
this is normally this that the . think . 
if we we quote all the sectors from to the trade Ministerial , same if we Pension to the sector of the care of health , the most of between we the écarteraient . 
. can therefore understand that he not that not been to the Prime plan of the negotiations robust . 
the second something who topic the bill of bill is that he the applies to the activities trade of the sector private . 
of new , when . think to the activities trade , . not is not inclined to think headwind to the sector of the care of health . 
however , when . is " of reflect to the question , . the conscience of the fact that of the Laboratories and other have of the activities trade . 
however , when the question of the activities trade is raised for the first time , . not think not immediately that he there has a great number of companies trade in the sector of the care of health . 
finally , he there has a factor in the area of the health who not there nowhere share , : a great number of institutions public and private may of the services identiques . 
the Laboratories may a example patent . 
he there has also of the services of praxithérapie and of the services of diagnosed . 
we not by not that they are different , because this are the same people who pay the note . 
also , I believe that that has been a oversight of good faith . 
he is can - be of note that when this bill of bill has been examined by the committee of the industry of the House of the Commons - and for show the interest that this bill of bill has has , I wish to you attention that he there has had 18 days of hearings that - that - . has spent very little of time to the health because the witnesses not had not asked to appear before the committee . 
. has many more spoke of the care of health before the committee Senate that before the committee of the House , this who not is in nothing a criticism of the committee of the House . 
human in the sector of the health not had including that this bill of bill would of important impact in this sector . 
in part , then that . between in of new areas commercial as the trade Ministerial and the rest , the barriers traditional between the various sectors of the economy the effondrent . 
, the future , when we Working of the bills of bill with these new types of systems of communication , this that the trade Ministerial is in fact , we we ensure to adopt of the measures review and to by all the these . 
I not think not that who that this be should be to blame , because he not there has not of whipping whipping . 
honourable senators , a series of things the are through here by inadvertent . 
this is a excellent bill of bill , but the committee think that he is statement the deal to this problem . 
by against , if . resolution the bill of bill without amendment , . is a bill of bill to a sector important of the society Canadian to the any of the wishes of all the organizations of the society . 
we believe that this not is probably not a good way of establish the policy public . 
the senator Oliver : 
that me brings to my second question . 
a sure number of witnesses of the sector of the health who have appeared have said that a solution possible for them extract to annexer their Code such that prepared or amended . 
can - you we explain why the committee not has not agreed these representations from of a sure number of witnesses of the area medical ? 
the senator Kirby : 
yes . 
this is a good question . 
the better example is the of the Association medical Canadian , who had said that we should integrate the Code to the bill of bill . 
the problem , this is that you not can the do quickly . 
why clerical the Code of the Association medical Canadian and not not the of the Association of the dentists or of the pharmaciens ? 
each has the Code of protection of the information personal . 
as the moment where you posez this question , you embarquez in the process detailed of negotiations and of to of a consensus who is required , as I the I said . 
the committee has concluded that , well that . can act of the so , that 7.6 clearly several months . 
we we therefore draft the Adopted of the bill of bill relatively to the sectors of the economy where all is in the order and of spend the 24 months following to the to of a consensus . 
he is true that several of the agencies professionals and institutionnels have mentioned that they have already a Code of protection of the information personal , of so that the members of the committee envisageaient with optimism the possible that the . can develop , to the over of this period of 24 months , to from of these various codifies , a together of codifies who would consensus and who the apply to the sector of the care of health . 
, our notice , he was better of act of the so rather that of take the Code of the a of the groups , then of the adopt and of the apply to all . 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I reprends that where the senators Oliver and Kirby have stopped . 
first , the people of the sector of the health we have in General said that they not have not participated to the development of the Code of the Association Canadian of normalisation on which the bill of bill is based . 
second , as the senator Kirby the has mentioned , some of between them feel that a member of the government their has left bode that the bill of bill not the apply not to the sector of the care of health . 
in reality , he seems that he not the applies not to of extensive pans of the sector of the health , be the consistently " not commercial " , there including to the links professionals between the patient and the doctor , the patient and the Hospital , and cetera . 
what that he in be , when you cherchez to or the activities trade of the activities not trade in the sector of the health , he becomes very difficult of determine where and how will the bill of bill . 
these two factors have been very important in this who respect the sector of the health . 
as to the possible of Issuance the Code of day of the doctors and of the dentists or of someone other profession in Printed to the bill of bill , I must say that I I been greatly tried of the propose . 
, the Reading of these codifies , he is clear that they make a together of standards rather higher to the Code obvious of a consensus of the Association Canadian of normalisation . 
I believe however that , same if we had decided of the do , we we would engaged in ground constitutional very little course . 
. would left hear that we take legislation and regulate to the regard of the professions , a area who provincial in the most of the case of the jurisdiction ours of the provinces . 
honourable senators , he is needless for me of try of add what that this be to this that we we heard of the share of the chairman of the committee under form of explanation , of context or of excuse for the amendment which we are before . 
the intervention to this regard has been complete and specific , and I me outline of say that I am fully of agreed with all this that he has said . 
I hope that the amendment will gain the approval of the Senate and finally of the government and of the House of the Commons . 
I take however of the opportunity for thank the chairman of the committee of we have led to good port and with success , until to present , all to the long of a review very carefully of a legislation legislative very important to which we we spent a 20 of p.m. . 
I the thank of we have wishes to a solution ; well that she not that can - be not been the solution hurling of all those who have before before the committee or same of all the members of the committee , she represents however a compromise hon. and practice who , I the said , will gain the approval of the Senate and of the government . 
the task not has not been easy for him , and we all , members of the committee , apprécions his patience and the leadership . 
I the said , I not add nothing to the explanation and to the context that he we has presentations regarding the sector of the health . 
I wish however to attention a other aspect of the bill of bill . 
this not is not a point on which the committee the is given , but he the is of a something who me concern many . 
I you the attention only for you ask of there reflect this last because I I the intention of there to to the step of the third Reading to of propose all probably a amendment . 
honourable senators , according a clause of this bill of bill , of the information very personal collected by of the businesses trade in the framework of their activities can be releases 20 years after the Late of the people in question . 
, my notice , this clause is indéfendable and , if I the can , I hear propose that she be last of the bill of bill to the time of his third Reading . 
I I asked to various witnesses who have appeared before the committee - of the Minister to the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy , in way by all they of advocates of the rights to the protection of the information personal - of justify the well - based of this clause , and no of them not has could the do . 
the only explanation that they have could give , this is that he there a clause 60 in the Act on the protection of the information personal , a clause who with of the information collected by the government federal and his agencies . 
he can ceased someone reason valid , in the policy government , for be a such clause in this who has relates to the information collected by the government - I the know and I like there to more later - , but I not can imagine no ground justified of to , to someone time that this be , of the information personal on of the cartes of credit , on a mortgage , on of the accountable banking or on a matter of pharmacie , who are collected by of the organizations trade to of the for trade . 
of any obviously , the bill of bill with already of the possible of investigate on a crime , of ensure the security national and and of the . 
. we has said : " Ces information not can not be releases . 
he must have a reason of the do . 
can - be the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy could - he speak to a sure time . " 
all that is very subjectif , particularly 20 years after the Late of the people in question . 
a lawyer who has appeared before we , Mr. Lawson , which I I spoke yesterday , and who is , as the most of the people who have appeared before we , a very advocate of the bill of bill , has said that , according him , the right to the protection of the life privacy not should the apply that to the people mystical . 
I am all to fact against this idea and I am of notice that we should the reject . 
I not want not studying on the speech that I will probably tomorrow after - afternoon , but I like you in give a before - politics . 
I want that you sagacity that I you saisirai of this clause and I urge the colleagues to me provide a excuse detailed , the they the can . 
if , I you inviterai to you join to me for amend the bill of bill to the step of the third Reading of way to remove this clause . 
honourable senators , as I the I mentioned to the second Reading , in biggest , this is a bill of bill who considerable and deserves of benefit of the support of all to the House and across to the country among those who are to the aware . 
this is that he étendra the protection of the Act on the protection of the information personal to the great amount of information personal that the businesses trade stood on each of we in the framework of their transactions . 
, the exception of the clause which I I spoke all to the time , all allows of believe that these measures of protection are solid and effective . 
as the senator Kirby we the has said , this bill of bill is the result of a consensus extraordinary which are upon the sector private , the government federal , the various groups of Defence of the protection of the life privacy and the groups of Defence of the freedoms fundamental . 
the government can to fair as be proud of have known wasn this consensus . 
for all those and all those who believe , and I think that the most of between we in are , that the protection of the life privacy fact part integral of the dignity and of the self human and that this is a right human , he the is of a step major . 
I believe that in would the bill of bill we will substantially improved the measures of protection and the framework legal of the rights human in this country . 
all the Canadians not are can - be not to the aware of this that we are in are of debate and of do today today , but I think that this bill of bill amended will the a of the accomplissements historic of this Parliament or of the last Parliaments . 
the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I thank the senator Murray and the senator Kirby for the excellent work that they have fact in this who respect this bill of bill . 
the senator Murray not is not normally member of the committee but , as he the has said more earlier in the intervention , this is a legislation legislative to which he the is always interested . 
well that in principle that not be not provided in the Rules of the Senate of the Canada , our committee steering was composed of four members . 
the senator LeBreton , the senator Kirby and me - same we associated the senator Murray to our discussions in reason of the interest deep that he the to this legislation legislative . 
as the senator Kirby and the senator Murray , I support in General the bill of bill C - 6 . 
I support also the amendment without no contingency . 
that intéressera can - be the senator Murray and the senator Kirby of know that . just fair of me thoughts a letter from of the Association dental Canadian . 
the association not like not particularly this amendment . 
she wanted that we seeing in a other direction . 
his representatives we have asked to the meeting of the committee of strengthen the bill . 
they have said that the Association dental Canadian had always been in favour of the Adopted of the bill of bill C - 6 , easier of the amendments who assureraient a more great protection of the information personal that the provisions of the Code CSA , in require the consent enlightened of the interested . 
I am of agreed with them . 
I souhaiterais me also strengthen this protection . 
the impasse before which the was found the committee was result to the question of the consent . 
if we had the of side all the other aspects of the bill of bill for not deal that of the ( for the health community of a protection increased of the life privacy , I not think not , honourable senators , that we have could adopt the less clause of this bill of bill before can - be six months . 
our amendment had for subject of speed the Adopted and the application of the sections dealing of the trade Ministerial in outside of the framework of the health . 
between - time , we could take the time of reflect , not not necessarily to the Senate , but in the framework of talks with the sector of the health , the sector of the industry , the ministers of the Health and of the Industry and their officials respective . 
all these parties commission would could to to the point of the changes who would for to this text of answer to the needs and objectives of the industry of the care of health . 
honourable senators , this question the is was to the centre of my concerns for the term of our study of the bill of bill . 
some witnesses not have treaty that of the sections regarding the trade Ministerial . 
they constituency the industry of the technology , the ordinatique in someone so , the sector of the Banking , the sector of the marketing , and they were all supportive to the bill of bill , not formulant that of the objections minor regarding his substance . 
in fact , they there expressed with enthusiasm . 
they the are helpfulness of the achievement monumental that had been the fact of have rallié the consensus of all these groups to the about of the Code of the CSA . 
the members of the committee not have not eighth to out that he not there had not consensus in the as medical . 
the doctors and the dentists have supported that their own codifies were senior to the model of the CSA . 
the pharmaciens , for their share , and those who stood of the information on the services of health decades a exemption total . 
for my share , I not was not interested to the their give . 
the they want use or sell my information personal , I should have my word to say on the information who their tomberont between the hands . 
fact more important still , we not we never discussed of two questions cruciales , be the regarding of the long " activity commercial " and " consent enlightened " . 
I I been vehemence of hear the Commissioner to the protection of the information personal saying that all the consentements are of the consentements chew . 
despite all the respect that I must to Bruce Phillips , I not am not of this notice . 
if . me dragged in a Room of emergency where I me ' before five doctors and 16 other members of the staff who me say that I I need of some interventions medical of emergency , I will sign not any what . 
I hope that those who will have to the deal to my place signeront not any what for that I will the care necessary . 
but this not is not a consent enlightened . 
I not know not the effects high of the treatment préconisé and , to the further , I not me in concern not angry . 
the question of the regarding not has not been clear matter , in this who respect the information personal in the of health . 
I support therefore without reserves the recommendation of the committee that that we prévoyions a deadline for study some of these problems . 
honourable senators , he must acculer the parties in because to the at of the ripe . 
the members of the committee have heard of the evidence varying and who sèment the confusion . 
he must of the time for define of the rules clear for the information personal in the of health after have had of the trade with all those who stood or use these information . 
he not enough not of delay of two years the into in into of the bill of bill for achieve our objective . 
the Canadians deserve that of the lines guidelines clear law the use of their matter medical and indiscriminately including their consent enlightened to this effect . 
the Canadians not wish not , for the most , that their matter medical be sufficient to the point that he not can not serve to of the research to to find a ahead to a illness or to a affection . 
if this information is necessary for test of new pharmacare , he will find then a balance . 
a such balance not there not in this bill of bill . 
we can only hope that this balance will found through to our reflection and to this amendment . 
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , I I a brief question to question . 
I in I caring the senator Carstairs more earlier today today . 
I not I not examined the bill of bill also carefully that I would should the do and I not I not taken knowledge of the evidence . 
however , in listening the argumentations , I me ask if the . not should not have for policy public of from the identity of the human which the information is required of the content of this information . 
by example , the Princess Mary Hospital , to Toronto , with each year 60 $ women afflicted of the cancer of the within . 
, side , the donor of the cancer of the within of the Mount Sinai Hospital receives 25 $ women by year . 
this is and that in this périmètre of someone 92 metres , 85 $ Canadians are soignées each year for the cancer of the within . 
the information to this about is now recueillie and colligée with of the researchers and diagnosticiens and regroupée in of the points centraux . 
of great progress have been made , to all the least , in the treatment of the cancer of the within . 
that the said , if the . to do a treatment , the content of the information is indissociable of the progress made by the sector of the research . 
if this information not was not recueillie , colligée and triée , the fight against this terrible illness that is the cancer of the within not progresserait not . 
the same reaching worth also for the HIV or any illness who we tragedy . 
I not I not too including if the committee or the amendment the the of this question fundamental . 
in reality , atténue . the problem or difficult . the task of the researchers who must have access to this information for the Progress of the research ? 
, the place of improve the situation , not are - we not in are of to vaine the research ? 
the senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , you be can - be these of learn that we we heard the evidence of two groups of researchers which the opinions divergent on this question . 
a group is of notice that he must establish more of measures of control for protect the life privacy of the people who fournissent the information . 
the other group believe that the research of this nature not must absolutely not be set to the provisions of the bill of bill . 
he believes that these measures of control provoqueraient the scenario assistance that the hon. senator just of record relatively to the inability of produce the information cope necessary . 
the hon. senator has explained our dilemma . 
we we heard of the presentations very seriously of witnesses who we have said that this bill of bill tortuous the Clinic of data of research as the that has opinion the hon. senator . 
of other have claimed that he not visiting not to the Clinic . 
of this manner , we not porterons not or to the research . 
our researchers have fact of the good work to this regard in the past . 
of such would that anyone not to not participate to a bill of research should have the right of refuse that the work lost to situation bill . 
he must therefore do of the protocoles . 
frankly , however , he we must of the time for the do . 
the senator Grafstein : 
honourable senators , if this bill of bill give place to a dilemma , why the motions ? 
why we believe - we forced of study this bill of bill if some of his supporters grow of seriously doubts to the regard ? 
the senator Carstairs : 
the problem with this bill of bill , senator Grafstein , this is that , of way general , human - and certainly human to the House of the Commons - not the is focused on the impact of the information in the of health on the bill of bill . 
the senator Grafstein : 
still of the work bâclé to the other place . 
the senator Carstairs : 
they have fact a work bâclé to the other place . 
be said in any justice however , they not the have not fact deliberately . 
the stakeholders of the sector of the health have them - same called the Department of the Industry . 
they him have said : " said bill of bill respect the trade Ministerial . 
he not has not of effect on we . " 
by therefore , the representatives of the health who would normally appeared before we to the beginning of the process not the have not fact because that they thought that the bill of bill not would not of effect on them . 
this not is that in May or in June of this year , after the study of the bill of bill to the other place , that the stakeholders of the health are their enough worried for say : " said bill of bill will of the effects on we . 
fortunately that he there has a second House , a House of reflection , because we can now go him airing our point of view . " 
and this is exactly this that they have fact . 
that the said , the bill of bill with without doubt to 90 per of trade Ministerial , and almost not of the sector of the health . 
. there find of interesting changes thereby the protection of the information personal in the area of the trade by Internet and that the Exchange and the Electronic of information on Internet . 
these measures should enter in into as that possible . 
I not like not delay all the process to because of this window that , I the hope , we we met and by which a over of renewal sweep for that we can continue of examine the question and , can - be , impose of the changes supportive in this who respect the information in the of health public . 
the the the Speaker : 
you pleasure - he , honourable senators , of adopt the motion ?

the hon. Pierre Claude Nolin : 
honourable senators , I attempt of be short . 
I not I not the intention of repeating the exploration of the components of this bill of bill . 
I rise the speak today today for support the Adopted of the second report of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional regarding the bill of bill C - 7 . 
he is obvious , honourable senators , that when he the is of sexual sexual to of the children or of the people vulnerable , he must act handcuff . 
a sexual sexual in is a of too . 
the consequences are serious and we must do all this who is in our power as parliamentarians for avoid that of such events not the occur . 
I like shown today today the need for the Parliament federal of adopt the bill of bill C - 7 , in me reference to a case of sexual sexual provide more earlier this year on three children in a " of the Quebec . 
I not nommerai not the city , because that the accusations criminal are pendantes . 
I attempt as that do the can of not not too identify the circumstances nominatives of this question criminal , but I want attempt when same of you the present all in complying the rules parliamentarians . 
in 1985 , a man well in view of a city Quebec creates a " . 
he the is of the unique " of this community stretch to closest of Montreal . 
the 22 November last , he is stopped and accused of sexual sexual on three fillettes of four years who him had been confiées . 
has in freedom the same day , he is stopped of new the next for be business on the site of the " and for have spoke to of the éducatrices of the " , and therefore of have contrevenu to the conditions of his implementation in freedom . 
this is the Branch of the protection of the Sexually who has alerté the police municipale after have received a administer of parents who association the services of the " . 
this who has the the fire to the poudres to the Quebec , this is that . has discovered recently that this same individual , in 1992 , had been found found and had received a condemnation with sentence for of the actions similar . 
, the time , human , in the city where he had created the " , same the services of police , not had been the to the aware of the background criminals of the requérant . 
the Leader of police of the community in question where the find the " not has taken knowledge of the background criminals of the individual that the 26 October last , therefore few days before that the actions of charge not be brought against the individual in question . 
honourable senators , these events have brought several remous in the society and the media Quebec to the over of the two or three last weeks . 
the Minister Quebec rules to the famille , Ms L , has should answer to the accusations of laxisme who were directed against the Department in this who has relates to the process of audit of the background criminals of the owners of " during of the Building of a for of operation for this type of activity . 
for avoid that the parents who envoient their children in the garderies calling not lose confidence in the system of granting of the for of operation of a " , the Minister of the Sécurité public , Mr. Ménard , has announced , the 25 November last , a plan of action for correct this situation . 
this last for a more great cooperation between the Department of the famille and the Sûreté of the Quebec for that the background court of all the choose of for of garderies be audited for avoid that of the case as the which I you I relaté the facts more earlier not the occur . 
the same day , the Minister rules to the famille has also announced of the measures additional for answer to the concerns raised by a member Liberal of the Assembly national , Mr. Copeman . 
this last had asked to the government , the 25 November last , during of the period of the questions to the Assembly national , if the measures of checks of the background court the étendaient to the 12 $ workers Quebec of the system of the garderies . 
according the Minister L , a new mechanism of control should be the in place of here the beginning of the year next , therefore in few days , for whether the antécédent court of the 12 $ workers of garderies of the Quebec . 
a part of this responsibility donate of the holders of for of services of Custody and of the members of the advice of Administration of the centres of the small boyhood , which will by , all contrôlés by the Department of the Sécurité public . 
this broader operation of audit morosity to the over of the next days and the shall , in the months to come , of way intensive . 
I am course , honourable senators , that those of between you who you followed the business of this House on the bill of bill C - 7 me see come . 
the Assembly national , in the effervescence , had forgotten , if this not had been by this competition of circumstances , who not is certainly not happy , that this question meeting of the jurisdiction of the Parliament federal . 
when . the concern of this who the is past during of this event to the Quebec , . not can that be satisfy of the 13.5 of this Parliament to the look on the measures contained in the bill of bill C - 7 . 
I not had not the intention of speak length , but I wanted you relater this history morbide who has over currently to the Quebec . 
as we the said the senator Andreychuk yesterday , the bill of bill C - 7 not is certainly not a panacea . 
he not dreaming not all . 
he not would not believe that because that we on in place these measures , we properly all protected now when we placerons our children in " . 
, the contrary , we autorisons the implementation in place of a mechanism additionnel of protection of the children and of the people vulnerable . 
I hope that this legislation can benefit of your support to the step of the third Reading and that she will to do of the Canada a society where the . is still able of live in security . 
honourable senators , I like say few words to the about of the bill of bill C - 7 , Act amend the Act on the stopped judicial . 
the chairman of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , the hon. Lorna Milne , has treaty yesterday of the report of our committee . 
I support this report . 
the bill of bill C - 7 the essentially on the process of preventative and is to facilitate the réinsertion social of the offenders who have demonstrated , when they were incarcérés , their will of become of the citizens respectueux of the laws . 
this bill of bill omissions to the departure some gaps who have been corrigées through to the amendments made by the committee . 
and , . ' now in the bill the definition of the word " child " and of the expression " people vulnerable " . 
. not can not something in the regulations of the regarding also important . 
the powers regulatory are now some in the bill ; the system of marquage of the casiers court is limited to the individuals who have been were for of the offences to uniqueness body . 
, this regard , a list of the offences simple has been added in Printed to the bill of bill . 
I must say , in ending that when the committee of the Affairs legal and Constitutional at a matter on the stopped judicial , as this is the case in the , decision or on a about as the ADN , we redoublons always of efforts for well we ensure that the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms is respected . 
we know all that the sections 7 and 8 of our Charter constitutional guarding the life privacy . 
this is a value fundamental in our system . 
I think that the . can say that the bill of bill C - 7 , who is to the study , respect to the better of our knowledge the Constitution , there including the Charter constitutional of 1982 . 
the hon. Joan Fraser : 
honourable senators , I like say few words on the question raised yesterday by the senator Andreychuk because that she is very important . 
she the concern , and with reason , of the possible that we portions they to the integrity of the system of shirts if we start to the gruger slowly . 
I believe that the members of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional are all to fact prepared to recognize that , first , we want preserve the integrity of the system and , second , the bill of bill not the not they to this integrity and the exception that he for , the the of the number total of pardons accorded , is if mineure and if valid that we not should not we in preoccupied addition legislation . 
honourable senators , this is statistiquement a small exception , and I I thought that you reach these to know these statistics . 
, the over of the 28 last years , close of a quarter of million of pardons have been accorded , all offences confondues . 
only 4 500 of these pardons have been accorded to of the authors of offences to uniqueness body . 
we about here of a very small per of the total . 
he is very clear that the bill of bill , such that amended , not is that the offences to uniqueness body . 
he will the Authorized of the Parliament for any other they to the integrity of the system of the pardons , and I believe that the Parliament réfléchira seriously before of body to this system . 
the the the Speaker : 
if no other hon. senator not wishes take the speak , I call to the Senators the motion to Adopted of the report . 
pleasure - he to the honourable senators of adopt the motion ?

Energy , Environment and resources natural 
Authorized to the committee of Engage of the staff and of the adjourn 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Spivak , seconded by the hon. senator Cochrane : 
that the Committee Senate Standing of the energy , of the Environment and of the resources natural be authorized to clerical the services of counsel , technical , employees of office or other elements necessary for examine the bills of bill , the substance of the bills of bill and the forecasts budget who him have been referred ; and 
that the Committee be authorized to the adjourn to across the Canada and to the abroad to the for of such reviews . - ( 
the hon. senator Hays ) . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I I had the opportunity of discuss of this motion with the author , the senator Spivak . 
I suggestion that we traitions of this question now . 
if the Senate there hear , we could amend the motion or the deal to the way of a amendment . 
I suggestion that the senator Spivak amend the motion in deleting the words " and to the abroad " in the last sentence of so that the motion the read as following : " That the committee be authorized to the adjourn to across the Canada to the for of such reviews " , and not not as she the reads now , to know " That the committee be authorized to the adjourn to across the Canada and to the abroad to the for of such reviews " . 
I urge the senator Spivak to we do share of his comments to this about . 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , I not believe not power accept of the conditions , but I can can - be satisfy the senator Spivak in him receive that I not know no other committee who that a such power . 
he is in my intention , in as that Leader Deputy of the government to the Senate , of adopt the same Position to the regard of the committee of the energy , of the resources natural and of the Environment . 
well heard , senator Spivak , all committee can come in this chamber to of obtain the leave or of the instructions for taxing outside of the Canada . 
I hope that that satisfy the senator for this question . 
the hon. Fernand Robichaud : 
honourable senators , the amendment proposed by the hon. senator Hays ask that the committee " be authorized to the adjourn to across the Canada " . 
the year last , the committee of the fisheries and of the Oceans wanted the adjourn to the for of a study and . him has more or least recommended of not not the do by the through of a under - committee because that that asked to the committee of Authorize of the Estimates . 
in this case , the committee receives - he the Authorized and the funds necessary , automatically , for the adjourn across to the Canada without in do a ask to the committee of the Economy Economy ? 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , I will deal that as a question who me is reply during of the debate on the about . 
the response to the question of the senator Robichaud on the fact that of the resources be automatically allouées to a committee for of the trips to the Canada is " not , this not is not the case " . 
in as that former - chairman of the committee of the energy and human responsible of the allocations of the mandate enough broad that I a now in doubt in as that Leader Deputy of the government , this mandate broad had been asked because that the committee has used of participate to of the conferences and to of the events who have place in of other parties of the Canada . 
by example , the senator Spivak me has indicated that the committee would send a or of the representative ( s ) to the conference GLOBE 2000 . 
the committee has always sent a representative to this conference and this last fact a report to the committee . 
I think that that the turns very useful for the business of the committee . 
however , for obtain the resources necessary for there send a member of the committee , he must to by the Committee Standing of the Economy Economy , of the Budgets and of the Administration and do approve the budget . 
usually , this committee the fact . 
this is the only response that I am in legislation of provide to the senator Robichaud . 
I urge the senator Spivak to we indication if she is interested to amend his motion or the he is necessary of there to of the changes . 
the senator Spivak : 
honourable senators , I am interested to the amend . 
for answer to the senator Robichaud , all the appropriation are précisés and will internally to further to the seen of the business who we waiting in the year to come . 
the the the Speaker : 
senator Spivak , must - I in déduire that you souhaitez that be retirés of your motion the words " and to the abroad " ? 
the senator Spivak : 
all simply the words " and to the abroad " . 
is this that I wish remove . 
the senator Hays : 
only the words " and to the abroad " . 
the senator Spivak : 
this is exactly . 
the the the Speaker : 
we - we the consent unanimous for remove these words ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , back to the motion key such that amended . 
could - we the to to the Senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the the the Speaker : 
of the Senators : 
enough ! 
the the the Speaker : 
pleasure - he to the senator of adopt the motion amended ?

that the committee , the report final to the more later three years after the date of his creation . 
today today , I can you saying that I am more determined that never to go of the before with this bill . 
I the I ample fact during of my speech of the 14 June last . 
honourable senators , to the over of the 30 last years , the sacrifices of our governments successive in this matter and the developing of the War against the drug in Troops since the beginning of the years 80 have cost very sir to the society Canadian . 
the costs associated to the control and to the repression of the Substances illégales are without common legislation with the level of consumption or with his effects on the society or the individuals . 
you me well admit , honourable senators , that this is a situation who deserves a review of the more rigorous . 
this is why , the 2 November last , I I tabled to new before this House a motion Requesting that a committee Special of the Senate be up to of reassess the laws and the political Canadian antidrogues . 
the objective of this year will , first , of give to the Canadians a information exactly and tough Current to the Substances illégales ; second , of assessment the moral of notions of the society Canadian to the regard of the use of the Substances illégales and , finally , of give to the government Canadian the information necessary to that he can expand and implanter a legislation and of the political legitimate who reflect the values and the will of the people Canadian in this who has relates to the Substances now identifiées as the illégales . 
honourable senators , you you perceived , without doubt , a change of attitude home the Canadians in this who has relates to the political of control of the Substances and to their results . 
the Canadians and the Canadians start to the to the that the are of money important net in the repression of the consumption and of the ' of the stupéfiants not Whelans not the results hoped . 
we we also need of know the experience which in this area in of other country . 
we we must of assessment the solutions of alternative fortitude by of other country , of the solutions least prevalence and who make a better réinsertion social of a educate important of the society . 
during all the been last , I I had the opportunity of although the country and of meet several Canadians who were agréablement surprised by my intention of you ask of create a committee Special of the Senate for reassess the policy Canadian antidrogues . 
they people of all the as . 
I I met of the policiers , of the stakeholders with of the users of Substances , of the doctors , of the Fathers and of the mothers of family , of the lawyers , of the senators , of the upon of university , of the students , of the journalists . 
I I also participated to several shows of lines open to the over of the been . 
many of stakeholders were of agreed for say that the policy of the government in the of control of Substances not works not and that , finally , this policy of repression top extremely sir and causait many more of wrong that of well . 
number of people and of institutions me have offered their expertise , their resources and their participation to the business of the future committee . 
, the over des15 last years , Mr. Puder the is fought against the ravages engendrés by the War against the drug on the people of the will poor of this city . 
he has spent the rest of his life to organizing of the campaigns of prevention and of education with of the young of the community , for their shown the consequences Mortgage of the use of marine addressed . 
he has also taken share to of many campaigns for ask to the government federal of adopt a policy antidrogues who maybe this problem as the a question of health public rather that criminal . 
I wish to i , by the present speech , my sincere sympathy to the members of his family . 
I wish also to tribute to the courage and to the determination dontM. Puder has fact evidence to the over of the last years and that to the together of the work . 
I will out that the message of sympathy of the senator Chalifoux to the place has been noticed and appreciate . 
the months last , I I participated to two million similar to the ; of Ottawa and of Moncton . 
despite a time responsible , of many students the are Earmarked for participate to these discussions . 
in reaction to the announcement of my bill , several editors and commentators of the media of across to the Canada have reacts positively . 
these the have been surprised that a such initiative provienne of the Senate . 
I say that they have was the Tabled of my motion as a bouffée of air costs in the loss policy Canadian . 
, this as , in the edition of the 21 June last , the Globe and Mail " that the Senate was absolutely give the agreed to this bill for shown a time for all that our political current in the of the Substances not working more , and I quote : 
some questions of policy public are so épineuses that the politicians are almost all for avoid of in speak . 
the conception legal of the use not medical of the Substances is a of these questions ... 
a report seriously of the Senate could airing the cost direct high of the policy current and the compare with the of solutions of alternative realistic . 
if this report people a broader support with of the public , he could convince the politicians timides that of the reforms are palatable . 
this is the policy , not the reason , who has country the members to refuse he there has three years a bill of study Joint of the question by the Commons and the Senate . 
the senators accompliraient a service public the they the chargeaient them - same of this study . 
honourable senators , the 26 November last , during of the caucus of the mayors of the 21 more major cities of the Canada , the members of the Federation Canadian of the municipalities , I I presented my bill . 
this association , who so more of higher municipalities Canadian , has adopted , he there has two years , a resolution who support the policy prohibitionniste of the government federal in the of control of the Substances addressed . 
this resolution enjoignait the authorities federal to not not amend the provisions of the current Act Drugs some Substances and other marine . 
however , the 21 April last , the Association Canadian of the leaders of police has recommended to the government federal of décriminaliser and not of légaliser the possession of small amount of stupéfiants , including the héroïne . 
this who was the more encouraged in the taken of Position of the Association Canadian of the leaders of police , this is that she recommended to the people Canadian and to the government federal of adopt a approach who traiterait all the questions provisions to the consumption abusive of stupéfiants as a problem of health public . 
I wish to you remind that this Position has been seconded by the Mounted Royal of the Canada . 
since this taken of Position , the Federation Canadian of the municipalities is in are of its his own Position on this question . 
she attempts of expand a new strategy in this area , represents on the reduction of the barristers to the users of Substances . 
the federation , to the behalf of his members , has fact , a letter to the Minister of the Justice Requesting that the government creates a forum where this question would debated . 
this is this that I you move today today with the creation of a committee Special on the Substances illégales . 
the municipalities have a role important to play in the reform of our political antidrogues . 
they constitute the level of government the more it of the citizen . 
they roles a Position privileged for determine what are the major problems and consequences Social engendrés by our political répressives antidrogues . 
the mayors are aware of this responsibility and they have asked this that they could do for amend this situation . 
as we all , they are to the research of solutions alternatives to these problems social . 
as we , they in are came to the conclusion that the political of repression used for the control of the Substances illégales are inefficient and related very sir to the citizens . 
by , , the members of the caucus of the mayors of the major cities Canadian have helpfulness the members of the Senate of have well was the proposal that I I introduced in June last . 
of more , the caucus has adopted to the unanimously and in the entirety the motion who is before you . 
, this effect , is this that the mayor of Edmonton , Bill Smith , wrote in his letter of the 29 November 99 : 
I support certainly the motion that you you introduced to the Senate . 
, my notice , that just certainly étayer the need of a Senate and the good work that gets this institution . 
as I the I said to the meeting , that me " always of hear of the people to the Canada criticize the Senate . 
I know personally of many senators and I know to what point they working very for the Canada . 
I wish to out that several of the mayors that I I met souhaitaient to their contribution to the business of this committee . 
back now to the conduct of the business of the committee . 
, from of the mandate described in the motion , the study that I you move today today will divided in 12 themes . 
the honourable senators who want participate to the business are the welcome but , to of the for of effectiveness , I attempts of limit to five the senators who will attitrés to the business of the committee . 
each of the five senators who will members of the committee will the Engage to take in with the business of research of two or three des12 themes . 
I wish to you in avertir , the task of lead the research and of sélectionner of the witnesses not will not Senators only to the steering of the research and to the coordinator of the committee . 
he the is of a work rigorous . 
each of the senators who will in for these issues will do report to the other members of the committee of the Progress of his research . 
some of between you will can - be say that he the is of a approach too tough . 
, : , I contend that I believe firmly that in would this way of work , we able accomplish our mandate of a way objective and serious . 
we want give a information transparent , objective and verified by the members of the committee . 
if we want rise the debate to a level more seriously and well inform the Canadians and the government , we not we not of other choice that of adopt this type of approach . 
honourable senators , I not I not the intention today today of to in detail each of the 12 themes who will included in this study . 
I will speak only of those who are really important to my " for that the committee can study these questions . 
you you all , I in am am , taken knowledge of the document that I you had has in June last . 
when they will informed , the committee will the invite to participate to our business for attempt of discover what is their level of notions in the of Substances . 
why I - I used the word " notions " , honourable senators ? 
you will understand in read the researchers on the history of the Prohibition to the Canada and in the world . 
you will understand that the questions of health public not have never been taken in the when had the time of legislation and of prohiber , and : as the first Prohibition , who has been the of the opium . 
he not has never or almost been question of health public , but he has ample been question of notions public , of racism , of trade international , of the importance that . was give to the companies of products generic . 
all the questions of trade and of notions have engendré the Prohibition that . knows today today . 
the Canadians understand that all the countries of these treated have led tranquillement the people of our country , because the parliamentarians , of good faith , not the are never retournés for see of where had the Prohibition . 
. has thought this that our ancestors we had said , . has foncé and . has continued to prohiber and to sign of the treated for prohiber still more . 
today today , . the ' in the situation that the Dr. Riley you has opinion in the report that I I tabled in June last . 
I could you in speak during long , but I not I not the intention of take more of your time . 
you you before you the benchmarks iterations of the mandate that I you ask for the committee , a mandate of a term of three years . 
as I the I said all to the time , each member would the responsibility of some facets of the mandate overall , and this is a work very rigorous . 
why ? 
he there already many of research scientific in this area . 
this is can - be the about who has been the more examined in the second half of the 20 century . 
he the is of eliminate this type of research and of the focus with hold on the research scientific may . 
each member of the committee would the responsibility of a of the facets of the review . 
all that can easily the échelonner on close of two years . 
after that , he the is of write a report interim , of inform the Canadians of this that we will discovered , of significant then their reactions for in happen to the step of the report . 
he there will in over of road a election federal . 
I can think that we properly to same of avoid the écueils that can we to a election federal , particularly when he is question of a about also sensitive . 
I rather therefore have more of time for do the work and and avoid of be forced of produce a report who will looked in pâture to of the politicians who not rechercheront that of the issues for which the emotions of the Canadians could be éveillées without that . their give any the information necessary . 
( on the motion of the senator Kenny , the debate is adjourned . )

the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I like do a observation on the development of the order of referred to the regard of a great question as the of the fisheries , who is vital and that I support fully . 
the week last , we in we public a on the agriculture and a other on the Forestry . 
the senator Nolin in ask a on the Substances addressed . 
the senator Kirby in ask a on the services of health . 
some of the studies in question dureront can - be a year or two . 
in the case of the of the senator Nolin , she will three years . 
before of approver these studies special , we should obtain a view of the costs in question , of as more that , to my knowledge , the budget of our committees - I not believe not that the situation that changed these last years - is always very limited . 
he the is probably of the position budget the more canvassed and always under - supported . 
I not want not to a preferment to the study proposed by the senators Comeau and Robichaud . 
before that we not seeing too far , I believe however that we should have a view General of this that these studies back to the Senate and of the amount that we are prepared to Engage to the over of the two and three next years . 
we constaterons can - be that we not able not complete some of these studies , fault of funds or of prévoyance . 
the senator Comeau : 
the problem that he there has to present a budget before of obtain a mandate , this is that without mandate , . not can present a budget . 
of first , he must have the mandate and then , we can we address to our committee and prepare the budget . 
if the committee Standing of the Economy Economy , of the Budgets and of the Administration believes that we should go of the before with the study , . can in discuss to this time - that , but we not can all simply not prepare a budget without have to the pre a mandate .

however , for the moment , if the forecasts budget not are not renvoyées to our committee , well heard , we not the renverrons not to the Clerk if the Senate not seat not . 
the hon. Fernand Robichaud : 
honourable senators , if I then add few comments and can - be assure the hon. senator Lynch - Lynch , when we we considered this motion , he the was in fact of have a mandate enough broad for we allow of study all the questions provisions to the fisheries . 
he was all to fact heard that if we we taxing , a budget would prepared and presented to the committee of the Economy Economy , of the Budgets and of the Administration to that we can respect the guidelines that each committee has showed of control his Estimates . 
the year last , the committee of the fisheries and of the Oceans has s has a trip on the Coast Western because that . not could not find the funds necessary for do this trip . It 
is well including that this not is not a question of budget and of the expressed a little across to the Canada . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
this not was not my intention of let confused a doubt around of the motion of the senator Comeau . 
I wanted ask that . be as that possible always intending of the fact that our Budgets are very limited . 
also laudable that be the studies Changes , particularly those who the prolongent on a period of two or three years , he would good that the Senate be before of the costs immediately for not not have of bad surprises .

the maturation in metastasis 
the hon. Lucie pin : 
honourable senators , he there has three weeks , of the researchers of the University McGill have said have helped with success several couples to do of the babies , even of the twin , through to a new method révolutionnaire . 
the method who removing the changing of the ovules immatures of a mother in embryons the Order the maturation in metastasis . 
the MIV result of the method of fécondation in metastasis who has révolutionné the treatment of the infertility in the years 70 . 
the maturation in metastasis from of the fécondité in metastasis of the fact that , in the MIV , the ovule is country to mature then fécondé to the outside of the utérus of the mother , then that , in the FIV , the ovule already mature is fécondé in laboratory . 
the MIV has been implementation to the point in Korea of the South and in Australia to the beginning of the years 90 to the intention of the women which the ovules not could be drew naturally to mature . 
until to recently , the rate of success of the MIV was low , but the Dr. Seang s Tan , steering of the 251 of obstétrique and of gynécologie to the University McGill , has changed the things . 
in réussissant to to the ovules to mature to the outside of the body , he has open the the to of new practices of fécondation in metastasis allowing a rate of success higher to the low 20 per present . 
this technical seems succeed to the women who have tried without success of become repatriated by of other ways . 
in addition , she costs the half of this that top the FIV . 
what wonderful new for the couples who will in benefit ! 
but that in is - he for our society ? 
with the variety of new technical of reproductive , the response , this is that we are in the uncertainty . 
we are very happy for the couples who , through to this Technology , will capable of have of the children . 
but the things not are not also simple . 
who should benefit of this Technology ? 
who has access to this treatment ? 
that must - . know before of the put to this treatment ? 
what are the impact incidental of this treatment on the plan moral to short , way and long term ? 
the issues are if complex and the applications future of several of these technologies are if extensive . 
this is a area where he not there has or says or white , but that of the gris . 
in 1993 , the Board Royal on the new technical of reproductive has presented the report making , between other , of create a commission national on the technical of reproductive . 
this commission was supposed do several things . 
first , she would authorised of the for to the institutions , and would set the standards and eye the practices provisions to the use of the technical of reproductive existing . 
second , she would coast , s and release to the public the information on these technologies . 
third , he was provided that she monitors the for of technical and of practices new and that she resolution of the political . 
finally , she was facilitate the cooperation governmental in this area . 
unfortunately , the government federal not has not given the to this recommendation . 
each time that I hear speak of the implementation to the point of a new technical to the Canada , I regret the absence of a commission national . 
we not we not of body national responsible of examine the questions that pose these technical or of in regulate the use . 
I urge the government federal to bye the recommendations of the commission Royal of 1993 and of take as that possible the measures who the do for create a commission national of the technical of reproductive . 
the Ontario 
the bill on the restructuring regional - - proposal of declare Ottawa formally bilingual 
the hon. Lorna Milne : 
honourable senators , of by the right and the Constitution of the Canada , the government of the Ontario is petty of all the municipalities of the province , and the government present is absolutely determined to in do the evidence . 
unfortunately , this same government not has never did , not would - this that a second , to impose his will to the citizens of the province . 
I wish to out that the government summer not has never forced the municipalities that he has done to adopt the beside " formally bilingual " . 
Ottawa is however a pay as nowhere other . 
this is the capital national of this country bilingual who is the ours . 
honourable senators , I urge the government summer to follow the recommendation Mr. Glen Shortliffe , the counsel Special on the restructuring of the region of Ottawa - Carleton , and to declare formally bilingual the new city of Ottawa from of the amalgamation , city who is also the capital of the Canada . 
of the Senators :

question PERIOD PERIOD 
the transport 
the airport of Fredericton - - of of the negotiations Honourable to the transfer to the Administration aéroportuaire local 
the hon. M. Robertson : 
honourable senators , I like question a question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
many of parliamentarians of the region of the Atlantic the concern now of the uncertainty surrounding the service Air offered to our more small communities in the region . 
however , the airport of Fredericton has a other problem in more of this uncertainty . 
all those who under this airport know that he has been out to the over of the years . 
the government federal negotiating for transfer the airport to the authorities local . 
however , this neglect starts to do feel his effects . 
she duration since long , some years . 
because that . has out the facilities and that . has fact ignored of the needs current of the airport , according a clause The in the on Gleaner , the consultants of the Administration aéroportuaire of the Grand Fredericton him have out that a Investment de20 million of $ is necessary for do in so that the airport will to the standards current or to the standards who the do of our days . 
. the ask same if the blistering key not is not too short . 
the government federal not is not prepared to do this Investment of 20 billion of $ before of transfer the responsibility of the airport to the operators local . 
in this case - that , the Administration aéroportuaire local has little of opportunity of succeed . 
he the can also that the revenues aéroportuaires down to the the of the restructuring of the industry of the transportation Air and of a reduction possible of the number of atterrissages . 
the opportunity that a new exploitant nervous are still least major . 
he the is , to my notice , of a question of equity . 
if the Administration aéroportuaire of the Grand Fredericton must have a real opportunity of succeed and of operating the airport , who connection the capital and the centre of the New - Brunswick , the government federal must recognize that he must really , in the framework of the negotiations with the Administration aéroportuaire local on the taken of control of the airport , to the of all the years where he has treaty of way unfair this airport . 
the Leader of the government provide he to the Senate a the the of the negotiations surrounding this problem seriously for the people of Fredericton ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I not am not very to the aware of the negotiations in over to the about of the airport of Fredericton , but I know what process has been adopted in of other regions of the country . 
I know particularly well the case of the airport of Halifax , where a process similar has been adopted and where of the questions similar have been raised . 
I must here to tribute to my predecessor , the senator Graham , which the work has widely contributed to convince the government federal of fund the improvements made to the capital of the airport of Halifax . 
of any obviously , this is a question who is occasion when of such negotiations are businesses . 
a precedent has certainly been established . 
as to know what will the outcome of these negotiations , I not am surely not in legislation of surfacing of the assumptions , but I am aware of the importance of the problem . 
I am prepared to do share of the concerns of the senator to the Minister in because . 
the senator Robertson : 
Mr. the Minister , I you in would very grateful , all as the would without doubt also of other senators . 
he seems that . that answered enough well to their needs . 
however , we like obtain a the the of your intervention with of the Minister to of ensure to this that the situation own to Fredericton be resolved quickly and with many of equity . 
we we with forward of obtain your response to this about . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I am personally prepared to to this question with the Minister of the Transport , the hon. David Collenette . 
of more , when the opportunity the will , I me will a happy of discuss of the problem with my colleague of the Council private from of the province of the New - Brunswick . 
the airport of Fredericton - - inaptitude of the system of pistes to welcome some aircraft 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I I a question Supplementary . 
the Leader of the government could - he , to the over of his discussion with the Minister of the Transport regarding the airport of Fredericton , draw the attention of this last on the study of 1992 of the Department of the Transport who illegality the need of extend to 78 $ feet the blistering is - west ? 
now , this blistering not can welcome that of the aircraft turbopropulseurs . 
the blistering south - west can welcome of the DC9 and of the BAC146 and , when he fact a , the of to reaction regional . 
I ask to the Minister of to the question with the colleague , the Minister of the Transport , but also with a other of his colleagues , the Minister of the Defence national . 
other said , honourable senators , the Airbus of the Forces Canadian not can not atterrir on the more great basic of the Forces Canadian to the Canada , this who seems enough invraisemblable . 
when he there has of the travelling of soldiers of the basic of Gagetown - and he the is of the more great basic of the Forces Canadian not only to the Canada , but also , to the level geographical , to the Commonwealth British - they must the to in bus to Moncton , where the find a blistering more long " welcome the Airbus of the Forces Canadian . 
I me ask if the second dimension of this need , implementation in obviously in the own study of the Department of the Transport of 1992 and then in the fact that the army of Gagetown the find that and that the military not can not there do atterrir their aircraft , could be occasion . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I would happy of i to the ministers in question the comments of the Leader Deputy of the Opposition . 
the Affairs Intergovernmental 
the Ontario - - restructuring regional municipale - - refusal of the province of declare the capital national bilingual 
the hon. Jean - Robert Gauthier : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
the capital of the country , ENAP Harris and company , would therefore unilingual English . 
this new city of Ottawa regroupera under a same Administration all the municipalities urban of the region of Ottawa - Carleton . 
this decision of the government Conservative Mr. Harris demonstrates to what point he know the reality Canadian , a country to two languages official . 
he is unacceptable and intolérable that the Canada that a capital national unilingual . 
we would the unique capital to the world who " the bilingualism hospitals . 
I not know not of country to two languages official or more who not has not respected the duality linguistic in his capital . 
the Minister can - he we say if the government federal has the intention of do pressure with Mr. Harris and of the government for that he respect the two languages official , be the French and the English , in the capital of our country ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the statements who have been made to the Senate by the senator and that by the senator Milne more earlier and of other yesterday reflect my point of view that that he is absolutely that the capital of the country be bilingual . 
the Administration municipale is certainly a responsibility provincial , but Ottawa is a city similar to no other to the country . 
she is the capital of the country . 
before of answer to the behalf of the government , honourable senators , I like do an that I believe firmly that the city of Ottawa must be a capital national bilingual . 
honourable senators , the Prime Minister has spoke publicly to this regard . 
he liaise with the Prime Minister of the Ontario and the pressera of take the measures who the do for ensure to this that the capital of the country be déclarée formally bilingual . 
the hon. Pierre Claude Nolin : 
honourable senators , I listening the response given by the Leader of the government and I am fully of agreed with him . 
the senator Gauthier : 
honourable senators , I understand the Position of the government . 
the pay of Ottawa - Carleton is a creation of the government provincial and is therefore under his juridiction . 
all of same , the Minister can - he say if the government federal , before a refusal of the province of declare the capital national bilingual , disposes the power constitutional or the powers that him authority the Act on the languages official for correct this situation and do in so that a city of Ottawa agrandie be and remains the capital national of the country with two languages official ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , a sure number of people férues in the constitutional , there including of the senators , are of notice that the clause 16 of the Act constitutional authority a sure power to the government federal for speak in of the questions similar . 
all this that I then say of a point of view legal , this is that the government federal and the Prime Minister are , in this time same , in are of examine the question . 
any question constitutional is complex and require usually a review carefully . 
frankly , I think that the government préférerait that the question be resolved without point to the courts . 
hope that the Prime Minister of the Ontario will to the wishes clear views of the people of the country , of the senators , of the Prime Minister and of other personalities . 
he is to hope that the Prime Minister of the Ontario will these comments to the seriously and that he finds the fusil of épaule . 
the senator Nolin : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
I am of agreed with your response and with this that your government attempts of saying . 
he not fact no doubt that we we we question the question , to know this that we will of the region of Hull , who fact also part of the region of the capital national . 
this is a all other problem . 
what assistance financial are - you prepared to to to of you ensure that the government of the Ontario not using not the reasons economic for avoid of change the situation ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , he the is of a question who ask of frank discussions between the Prime Minister of the Canada and the of the Ontario . 
I believe that these discussions will place and that the Prime Minister of the Canada off then , when he will in consideration all the comments who will been made , of the least in this House , that we are very supportive to of the measures to to do in so that Ottawa be a capital bilingual . 
he would impossible of do of the conjectures on the details of these discussions for the moment . 
however , the message has been given clear . 
the government of the Canada and the Prime Minister the taking to the seriously . 
. hope that the Prime Minister of the Ontario in will as . 
the hon. Marcel homme man : 
honourable senators , after of long deliberations , the Queen Victoria had decided that Ottawa would the capital of the Canada . 
Montreal , Kingston and Toronto had we been of the capitales , and the things not the were not well fellow in no of these cities . 
this is Ottawa who had been chosen . 
I agree with the senator Nolin that . would favourite that Hull be added to Ottawa , but however , Ottawa is the capital of the Canada . 
I am can - be little in disagreement with my colleague , in this sense that the government federal should be of the funds or a your . 
I ask that Ottawa reflects a ideal . 
me , I am a Canadian French of the Quebec . 
by therefore , the government federal should remind to the people of Ottawa and to the government of the Ontario that this city should the really this that . wanted that she be , the capital of all the Canada . 
since I like be positive , I remove same that the hon. Leader of the government think , with all his colleagues , to propose a motion to the Senate to of remind to all the responsible that Ottawa should the the real nature of the Canada . 
the Leader of the government songera he to propose a simple resolution of the Senate for remind to all the world that Ottawa should represent all the Canadians ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , we réfléchirons certainly to this suggestion . 
by , , I like also me do the here of this that the hon. senator has said in the preamble . 
he has been many more eloquent to this about that I not could the be , but he the is certainly of a case of a importance serious for we all . 
the transport 
the acquisition of the Airlines air Canadian International by Air Canada - - regulatory of a requires monopoly in the industry of the transportation of the travellers Threat - - policy of the government 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I I two or three questions regarding Air Canada and his merger with Canadian International and the any last decision of Air Canada . 
as we the know all , Air Canada has now order to the 23 December the date limit for the Tabled and the regulation final of the actions and and of the . 
the society Air Canada not has not indicated of way detailed in what ; the problems , but she has left hear that she for to obtain the consent of agencies of regulatory , of same that a confusion of the provisions of a bill of new regulatory or of new policy . 
must - I in déduire of these statements general that . has proposed someone something in this sense , that . in has discussed with the leaders of Air Canada and that their review of the proposal the on ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
the senator Forrestall : 
this is because that this was a clause of the Presse Canadian . 
the senator Boudreau : 
the committee of the transport of the House of the Commons has tabled the report . 
the senator Kinsella : 
he not the is however not stopped to the clause 47 . 
the senator Boudreau : 
he not fact no doubt that the report of the committee Senate of the transport and of the Communications will tabled very soon . 
the two reports may can - be a direction as to a policy specific in the of transportation Air . 
I am to the aware of the ground of the postponement of the offer of Air Canada . 
all this that I know for the time , I the I read in the Globe and Mail . 
air Canada - - increase of the rates Threat 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , we we seen Air Canada preferred a second step . 
the first step , who has consisté to let hear that , if the government tried of someone way that this be of reduce his freedom of movement , she would the offer , this who would the écrouler all the bill of merger , has had the effect of a real gifle to the government of the Canada and to all the Canadians reasonable . 
he there has certainly someone something who the prepares to the about of the rates in the discussions between the government of the Canada and Air Canada . 
in reason of the increase of the price of the fuel , we come fair of order a increase general of 3 per of the rates Threat , this who is a real abuse . 
these rates at always and not redescendent never . 
human not seems know why they not can not redescendre . 
there has he of the discussions on the process of regulatory between the government of the Canada and Air Canada who justifieraient that the society air take of all the opportunities , pools the competition and the encaisser to the consumers a increase of 3 per of the rates ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
the interests of the people Canadian , of the small communities of all the Canada and of the travellers will to the heart of any discussion with Air Canada . 
the senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the government to the Senate could - he we say if . will ask to Air Canada of cancel the increase of 3 per until to this that a deadline décent the be expired ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I not think not that he me responsibility of defend a transporteur Air national . 
however , . we said that the increase is result to the fact that the cost of the fuel the is increased , if I not me read , of 100 per to the over of the the months . 
if the price of the fuel down , we see if the rates Threat down also . 
Affairs Social , Science and Technology 
bill of bill on the protection of the information personal and the documents electronic - - Opposition of the share of the government of the Alberta 
the hon. Douglas Roche : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the chairman of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology . 
the chairman has fact referring to a letter that two ministers of the government of the Alberta , Shirley McClellan , Minister of the on international and Intergovernmental , and Walter Paszkowski , Minister of the Affairs municipal , him have sent the 7 December for the against to the bill of bill C - 6 , to on the protection of the information personal . 
in this letter who has been widely accepted and who is the second communication from of the government of the Alberta , the province is to obtain of the amendments to the bill of bill for remove the sections who empiètent on the jurisdiction of the provinces , and that of other provisions . 
given given the representations leadership made by the government of the Alberta on the question of jurisdiction , what is the response of the chairman to the statement of the Alberta according which , if this bill of bill is adopted , the Alberta could be sterilization of one the constitutional of this legislation for maintain his powers to the words of the Constitution ? 
the hon. Michael Kirby : 
honourable senators , I will answer to the last question in all Prime place . 
same if some , including the government of the Alberta , can think that the bill of bill is unconstitutional , the constitutional consulted by the committee and , in fact , by the government are all to fact confident that the bill of bill will felt constitutional . 
the first question is a little more complex , to know that this bill of bill not the apply not to the activities intraprovinciales portion that the province that a bill of bill essentially similar to the bill federal . 
he would difficult for the businesses of be covered to two programs , this who would the case if a province was adopt a bill on the protection of the information personal in great part similar to the bill of bill C - 6 . 
he is obvious that this is a point of view legitimate and this is this who ask the clause the in the bill of bill federal : if a province resolution a bill on the protection of the information personal similar in great part , the bill of bill federal not the apply not in this case - that . 
rest to know , by example , if the before - bill of bill of the Alberta regarding the health is substantially similar . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , the questions way to the chairman of a committee not must not to on the about to the study , but strictly on the activities of the committee . 
the questions to on the further of this that at a committee not are not recevables . 
the senator Roche : 
honourable senators , seen these difficulties , there he a reason expliquant why . not has not asked to the government of the Alberta of testify before the committee for explain his Position , the given that , the 15 October , he had sent a first letter , who just of be followed of a letter quasiment identical ? 
the senator Kirby : 
honourable senators , I speak you the confirm tomorrow , but , of after this that I know , . has asked to several provinces who had sent a letter - including the Alberta and the Ontario - if they want appear . 
the Ontario has sent of the representatives , which the under - Minister Deputy of the Health . 
the Minister not has not appeared . 
if I me recall well , and the Clerk of the committee will the confirm , . has asked to the government of the Alberta the he wanted appear , but he has answered that his letter suffice as testimony and that human not comparaîtrait in the behalf . 
the transport 
air Canada - - increase of the rates 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , my question the on Air Canada and on the increase of the rates . 
the question has already been raised and . there has answered in part , but I would a question supplementary to question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
according the National Financial , Laura Cook , the - speak of Air Canada , would said to the about of the increase of the rates that the depository for the States - United and other destinations international had been incorrect and that their price not had not increased in reason of the competition . 
therefore , if Air Canada the ' in situation of monopoly to the Canada , without competition , must - he the expect to this that the rates not same of increase ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I not can or confirm or démentir this that just of say the senator Oliver . 
I will however seek to obtain more of information and I you in will share to the more quickly . 
the senator Oliver : 
the Minister not is - he not that he is shocking that the company air increase his rates domestic , but not his rates international ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , this is for the least surprisingly and this is a question who deserves of be working . 
the heritage 
the status of the Museum commemorative of the Holocaust 
the hon. Colin Kenny : 
honourable senators , I I given notice the week last of the question that I me without to question . 
of the groups concerned by the status of the Museum commemorative of the Holocaust the are adressés to me . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate could - he we say this that he in is of the status of the Museum ? 
the government only - he the commitment in the principle of the implementation in place of a such Museum ? 
if such is the case , can - . the expect to see the matter advance ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the commémoration of this event prosecutors in the history of the humanity is a question very important . 
unfortunately , I not can not in speak in detail today today . 
I me in apologize with of the hon. senator , and can - be speak - I the do as tomorrow . 
order orders OF 
bill of bill on the protection of the information personal and on the documents electronic 
third Reading - motion of amendment - Adjourned of the debate 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I I said yesterday that I had the intention of propose a amendment to the step of the third Reading of the bill of bill . 
he would can - be good that I the Reading of the amendment before of in speak . 
I move , seconded by the hon. senator Doody : 
pleasure - he to the honourable senators of adopt the motion ? 
the senator Murray : 
I has of how of time for speak ? 
the the the Speaker : 
as you are the Prime to speak to the step of the third Reading of the bill of bill , you disposez of 45 minutes . 
I must however you prevent that , pursuant to a order of the Senate , the sitting will adjourned adjourn p.m. 30 . 
the senator Murray : 
I you thank , Honour the . 
honourable senators , I you veterinary to the ) 7 ( 1 ) , who specific this who following : 
for the application of the clause 4.3 of the Printed I and despite the note afférente , the organization not can to of information personal to the insu of the interested and without the consent that in the case following ... 
this are of the reasons very valid who , of the notice of any human reasonable , suffiraient to justify the communication of information personal collected to of the for trade . 
however , the bill of bill lists then several circumstances more them . 
before of to the ) which I I proposed the deleting , I évoquerai two of the circumstances them . 
the a found to the ( f ) , who says that he would legal of to of the information personal without the consent of the human fall : 
... to of the for statistics or to of the for of study or of research érudites , these for not can be conducted without that the Intelligence be release , the consent is virtually impossible to obtain and the organization informed the Commissioner of the communication before of the do . 
nothing not for here that the Commissioner can interrupt the process or speak of someone way in the conduct . 
the right that him authority this under - ( is simply the of be informed when the information collected for of the ; commercial to the about of the human will releases " to of the for statistics or to of the for of study ... " 
in under of the ( g ) , the communication of information personal collected by a business is legal if : 
... she is made to a institution which the attributions understand the conservation of documents to a importance historic or archivistique , in view of a such conservation . 
he the is here of the information personal collected to your about , or to the about of any other human , by of the businesses in the framework of their activities - regarding by example your mortgage , your card of credit , your matter revamped . 
he is said here that these information personal you regarding can be releases only " to of the for statistics or to of the for of study or of research érudites " or , to the under - ( g ) , to of the for of conservation of documents to a " importance historic or archivistique " . 
let - we to the a to this part . 
we well age . 
in the most of the case , he nes' is not of citizens ordinary . 
. would here the right of access to of the information personal regarding of crowned personalities , that they are to the world of the policy , to the of the Arts or to a other . 
I think that he is time that we fixions a limit . 
the people in view have as the right that not any who to the protection of their life privacy . 
in this who respect the under - sub f ) and g ) , these people will still in life for the there against . 
they will , . there , the address to the Commissioner or to the courts , or something of other point before the bill for do protect their information personal . 
the clause to which I me am attardé and that I like do remove is the under - ( p.m. ) , that that the information personal so be releases in the case where : 
on what principle the based . for include a such clause in the bill of bill ? 
in the Tab of information that the government has fact distribute to the members of the committee , the explanation given for include this clause is the next : 
the Act on the protection of the information personal with of this question in part of the definition of the information personal to the for of the bill the information personal regarding a human died since ninety years . 
the approach restraint in this legislation legislative - this is more restricted , because she allows the disclosure of the information , but those - this remain subject to the bill . 
he is true that the Act on the protection of the information personal , who has been agreed he there has few years , protects the information personal that has a institution federal to the about of special . 
she exempte of his provisions in the of protection of the information regarding a human who is died since more of 20 years . 
as I the I said to several other opportunities , he can there have of good reasons , on the plan of the policy government , of to after 20 years of the information personal that have of the governments , of table these information to the courts ; but that not has nothing to see with the bill of bill that we us today today . 
we us a bill of bill regarding of the information personal collected in the sector private , and we we asking if a such clause should ceased . 
when the officials have appeared before the committee , I I asked the question next to Stephanie Perrin , Director of the Politique on the protection of the life privacy of the Group of work on the trade Ministerial to the Department of the Industry : 
if I understand well this clause and this ) , I - I reason of think that of the information personal collected by a body - a bank , a society of cartes of credit , a society hypothécaire , a company of insurance , or what still - could be releases 20 years after the Late of the human in question ? 
I - I reason of think and ? 
Ms Perrin : 
that means that he not is not necessary of ask the consent of the interested for book that . 
however , the disclosure of information must be valid to the words of the clause Current to the subject of the bill , of so that he must there have a ground legitimate for the disclosure of the information in because . 
he there has still a sure number of criteria . 
all this that that said , this is that . not has not need of the consent for book the information . 
a little more far , she said : 
you must actually your ; , if you représentez a body , for the Clinic , the use and the disclosure of information personal . 
I me am order to the bill of bill for see this which she spoke . 
I I read the clause 5 , who not is not really useful because that he not fact that we refer to the Printed 1 and who the states as following : 
the employment of the conditionnel in the Printed the that he the is of a recommendation and not of a obligation . 
I me am then order to the Printed 1 , where are out the principles . 
this Printed with primarily of the Clinic of information , and not not of disclosure . 
, the Reading of the Printed , . news that the clause Current to the subject must be called in preposition with the clause 4.5 of the Printed 1 , entitled : " Limitation of the use , of the communication and of the conservation " . 
I me am therefore order to this clause , and that I - I found ? 
I I found two or three paragraphs saying that the organizations " should " develop of the lines guidelines and apply of the procedures for the conservation of the information personal . 
I I found a other clause who the states as following : 
. should destroy , effacer or dépersonnaliser the information personal which . not has more need to the for précitées . 
all that not is hardly useful in reason of a clause who for that he would legal of book of the information personal collected for of the ; commercial 20 years after your Late . 
then , Ms Perrin and me are wars in the details , and I like that the senators leaves all major their ears . 
this clause well essentially to of the for of courts and historic . 
of any obviously , you not you not still heard the archiviste and the historians . 
why the would - he ? 
. has already protected to their interests . 
she continues in these words : 
they are convinced that , if we not we not a clause allowing to the agencies private , to the businesses and to the institutions of to of the information to the companies historic in the purpose of preserve of the issues historic , a information of great value will having . 
the bill of bill contains of the provisions providing the conservation of the information only also long that she is necessary for the for for which she has been recueillie , this who can strongly people the institutions to destroy the information which they not have more need . 
by example , a company of insurance with who you not feriez more case would strongly encouragée by this clause to eliminate the information you regarding when she not in has more need . 
however , some information this a interest historic . 
a example used in the letters way to the Minister is the of the courts of the Compagnie of the by of Hudson , which the - this has recently fact don . 
Détruisez your card of credit of - by , honourable senators . 
he the is of the issues of the company . 
if you upset in the bill of bill a clause who said that the information must be having when you not in you more need , who will of the courts ? 
he rest to the Banking and to the companies of insurance the possible of shown that they have including for service of maintain of the information " fundamental a importance historic . 
she attempts of the justify by of the principles , but I not think not that that be acceptable . 
let - me to on that . 
he the is here of Affairs personal and of information personal collected to of the for trade . 
. it hear that he could there have of good reasons historic for archiver all the information on Jean tien or on his predecessors or successors , that he the whether of information on his issues of cartes of credit , of mortgage or of pharmacie . 
I say that that not we taking not . 
I say that this type of information personal not taking human . 
of more , I say that we must understand the mentality , and I say that with a sure respect . 
I hope always have a sure respect for the science , there including for the Science Social , but we must understand the mentality of the experts in Science Social , of the genealogists and of all the other . 
they would we do maintain all the suffice . 
they would we do maintain all the information , because they believe that these the are relevant , also personal or friends be - they . 
they not common never that a across of paper hundred be destroyed , particularly the he respect someone a who is felt be relatively important , today today or in the history . 
they insistent on the fact that these information their are . 
I must add that some witnesses representative of the groups of Defence of the life privacy and some advocates of the freedoms civilian were very difficulty by on this point . 
I not believe not that they had thought to the question . 
I I asked to a witness of the behalf of Murray Mollard , steering of the British Columbia on Liberties Association , this that he in quite . 
his response has been : 
I not believe not that we we a Position official to this about . 
he the can that that that or not someone something see with the debate in over on the census . 
that not has nothing to see with the census . 
we about here of a question commercial . 
he has said : 
my notice spontané , this is that 20 years , this not is not very long . 
why 20 years , I not in know nothing . 
and of add a little more later : 
can - be my colleagues have - they someone something to add . 
I not in see not the reason . 
ninety years , that not me seems not very long . 
I I fact referring yesterday to the testimony of a lawyer of the behalf of Ian Lawson , of the British - British , who is a expert of the right of the life privacy and a parent of our colleague , the senator Kelly , this that , be said in way , I I discovered after the . 
he has said : 
can - be the companion - I , but the right to the life privacy the applies in principle to a human article . 
I about of the way of consider the interests in stake . 
in fact , for this who is of the procedure and of the application of the rights to the protection of the life privacy , I me ask the he would possible that the interest of a human be in stake if the human in question is morte . 
réfléchissez to the question , honourable senators . 
I not am not of agreed Mr. Lawson on this point . 
he there has also all they of ramifications for the survivors of the individual in question . 
however , the information personal among least exposure to the as and to legislation that the time what . 
this is can - be true , honourable senators , but this not is not , to my notice , a reason for to of the information personal to the about of this human . 
she has said then : 
he the is of find what would the deadline appropriate . 
I not am not Teleglobe to a deadline . 
he the can that a deadline of 20 years not be not sufficient . 
this not is not a Position of principle . 
for she , this is a question of time . 
fortunately , the Commissioner to the protection of the life privacy , Mr. Phillips , has been many more direct . 
I you remind that he has been the partisan of the bill of bill the more agressif and the more strong to appear before the committee . 
I him I asked of justify this clause . 
I will you read our Exchange . 
I say : 
... I you urge to justify in principle the clause of the bill of bill according which the information personal collected to of the for trade can be legally released 20 years after the death of the human that they with . 
justifiez care for we . 
Mr. . Phillips : 
I will try . 
this clause is the same that the who the find in the bill current on the protection of the information personal . 
she has been written by of the people who , of any obviously , believe that the right to the protection of the information personal expire to the death . 
the senator Murray : 
a lawyer we has said the same something today today . 
Mr. . Phillips : 
if this is the case and the he the is of a principle agreed in right , I think that this is a principle regrettable . 
I resolution a point of view different . 
I I learned in my quality of High to the protection of the life privacy that many of people the concerned of the information personal who could traîner to left and to right after their death and of this that he where of these information . 
he enough simply of think to the example of the efforts been by well of the people to the about of the security and of the inviolabilité of their documents personal after their death . 
the proposition according which the people not have not the right to the protection of the life privacy of the fact that they are dead is , to my notice , all to fact unacceptable . 
as we the know all the two , this argument is raised in a other context . 
. for now in the Act on the protection of the information personal that 20 years after the death of a human , the information personal not are more protected . 
the senator Murray : 
he not there has no reason for apply that to the sector commercial as this bill of bill the fact , not is - this not ? 
Mr. . Phillips : 
I not am not of distinction between the types of information . 
this who any this is this that the he in think , senator . 
you you reason . 
he must the ask why . 
he has answered : 
. me has said that the clause which you you spoke was a rule of archivage us . 
any disclosure should still respect the rest of the Code . 
by example , the disclosure of information personal must be made to the for for which these information have been collected . 
he is obvious that the Minister is in the mistake or that he not has not including my question . 
if the information are collected for a ask of card of credit or of mortgage or a order to the pharmacie , this is a something . 
he is question here of the disclosure of information to the for of archivage for of the for statistics or for of the research érudites or any other something of the kind . 
I not think not that he that well including the question that I soulevais . 
honourable senators , I I said to several occasions that , according me , the government and the Parliament who enter this bill of bill will the in enorgueillir . 
in effect , he widening the scope of the Act on the protection of the information personal to the information personal collected in the sector commercial private . 
however , the clause allowing the disclosure 20 years after the death of the interested is , according me , a serious deficiency of a legislation legislative by , excellent . 
human not has could defend this clause in the remedied on of the principles , and I think that she is indéfendable . 
we know all that the protection of the life privacy has inexorably lost of the ground to the over of the years . 
this is the experience that we we well until to now . 
this is the sense of the clause that I want do eliminate of the bill of bill . 
the right of to and of to of the information not should not the just on all the other rights . 
we can Authorize the Adopted of this clause and hope that she will always used of way responsible and in the respect of the rights legal in ever not existing of the people who the are éteintes , or still we can speak now and protect as we the should the life privacy of the people in this who respect the information think personal collected by their discriminates , their lenders mortgage , their pharmaciens and other . 
I hope that we will speak and do people this clause of the bill of bill . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I must you inform that , if the hon. senator Kirby the now the speak , the speech will assimilable to a debate of stomping . 
the senator Kirby : 
honourable senators , I finish me express to the about of the amendment but , what that he in be , I would proposed the adjournment of the debate . 
if I I well including the procedure , this is the amendment and not the motion regarding the third Reading who is to the study .

the senator Kirby : 
honourable senators , the given the uniqueness education , thought and dynamic evolve of the intervention of the senator Murray , I not like not there answer of way inquire this after - afternoon and I prefer take the speak tomorrow after - afternoon .

she reprenait and Dunton the words of a letter that the government albertain had reply le16 November to the chairman of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology . 
he the is of a letter of subject any against the bill of bill C - 6 . 
I not will not the read , but I am prepared to the do circulation . 
she not is not indications in the two languages , but I am prepared to the do circulation if a senator not the has not still received . 
short , the government of the Alberta written that this bill of bill be reconsidered and that . there supprime the sections who empiètent on the jurisdiction provincial for give the time to the small and medium businesses of the prepare as he is to the implementation in implement of the bill of bill and for allow the resuming of the consultation to to ensure the protection of the information personal . 
this is in substance this that ask the Alberta . 
the way of do usual is of appear before a committee during that he examine the bill of bill in question . 
I not want not me Engage in a long discussion on the reason for which the representatives of the government of the Alberta not have not appeared before the committee . 
he seems that they have présumé that the committee has taken in consideration the letter é November , and this is can - be well the case . 
the hon. senator Murray think he that the amendment that he just of present - and I I listened carefully when he in has statement the uniqueness limitatif - does of manner get to the objections raised by the government of the Alberta ? 
if , that should - we do to this about to this step - this ? 
we we a province who the a such interest to the bill of bill that . not should not to addition to his points of view in not the conclusion not enough in consideration before that the Senate not resolution the bill of bill in third Reading . 
the senator Murray : 
first , I not believe not that the government of the Alberta the be concern of the clause that I is to do remove of the bill of bill . 
second , I must say to my hon. colleague that , during the debate of second Reading , I I expressed the opinion of a layman , to take for this that that worth , in saying that the bill of bill represents a year valid and legitimate of the power of the government federal in the of trade . 
third , a opinion more Cabinet in the the has been position the other day before the committee Mr. Tassé , a former under - Minister of the Justice , who is of notice that the bill of bill is in the line of the powers of the Parliament federal . 
fourth , the bill of bill there a clause providing that this legislation not the apply not to the trade interprovincial of a province who , in a deadline of three years , resolution a bill of bill " essentially similar " in the of protection of the life privacy . 
fifth , well that all the Department worry of the Canada , to this that I far , have asked he there has long that the bill of bill be withdrawn for the reasons contained by the government of the Alberta , that not the is not fact . 
of the representatives of the government of the Ontario are came before the committee express their reserves to the regard of various aspects of the bill of bill , but they have refused of express a opinion or of saying that the Ontario has a Position on the constitutional of the bill of bill . 
when . their has asked specifically this that they in pensaient , they have simply answered that this was that the to discussion . 
a witness heard by the committee has said that the constitutional of the bill of bill would inevitably challenged before the courts , and I believe that the future him will reason . 
the senator Roche : 
I thank the senator Murray for this response . 
he has said that the problem could be corrected if the provinces adoptaient of the laws essentially similar to the of the government federal . 
the Alberta has s mentioned this point in the letter in saying that , since the expression " essentially similar " not was not occurs in the bill federal , she was too general for allow that of the laws correspondantes be adopted . 
the senator Murray : 
honourable senators , I not challenging not the argument raised by the government of the Alberta to the about of the uniqueness enough General of the expression " essentially similar " . 
however , I out that the only province who has a bill similar is the Quebec . 
the Minister of the Industry , issue to the behalf of the government , has already indicated that he jugeait the bill of the Quebec essentially similar to the bill federal . 
as to the other provinces , they have three years for consult and discuss . 
I believe know that the Alberta is in are of write a bill of bill . 
this province not is not multitude in the says . 
she can discuss to further of the question with the government federal , this that she fact . 
of after the remember that I Custody of a before career , the service public benefaction the of the counsel extremely competent in the area of the relations federal - provincial . 
I would brought to believe that he not is not files that the Alberta the evidence of good will and cheques a bill of bill adapté to his needs who be essentially similar to the bill federal . 
( on the motion of the senator Kirby , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the Act on the stopped judicial 
bill of bill Amend - Third Reading

since that he has been presented the first time , the bill of bill has greatly advantage of the work of the committee Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , who has the to the day of serious gaps in the bill of bill . 
the Solicitor General has answered with a largesse of spirit and a speed admirables in élaborant of the amendments to to improve the bill of bill . 
in the wording present , the bill of bill is , to my sense , a addition very useful to the right Canadian . 
for the essential , this legislation will to the protection of the children and of other people vulnerable who could be the practices of prédateurs sexual . 
honourable senators , he is important of note that he there will of important sauvegardes in this who respect the rights of the people réhabilitées . 
we take very to the seriously the integrity of the system of preventative . 
the access to the information personal on the offender will limited to the policiers given and to the staff of the agencies law of apply the bill . 
the postulant will sign a accompany by which he hear to this that the . check with of the branch general of the courts criminal the he there has in the fichier automatisé a indication allowing of determine the he there to the about a matter or a reports of a condemnation . 
the accompany of consent indiquera that the behalf of this human found in the branch normally scellée and made the names of people réhabilitées . 
the access to this indication not will possible that in concerning a sure Code in the computer . 
this are of important sauvegardes . 
in addition , through to the work of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional , the bill of bill specific now that he the applies only to the people scant guilty of a offence sexual who are réhabilitées . 
in this who respect the other offences , the issues of preventative remain scellés . 
the regarding data in the bill of bill have been greatly upgraded . 
the bill of bill contains now the definition material " children " and of " people vulnerable " . 
given given that this bill has been seconded by all the parties in the other place , of same that by the ministers provincial and territorial of the Justice and the authorities relating of the application of the laws across to the Canada , I believe that we must the support .

second Reading - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Carstairs , seconded by the hon. senator pin , Honourable to the second Reading of the bill of bill S - 2 , Act admissibility the taken of decisions medical legitimate relatively to the treatment of survival and to the treatment of the pain . - ( 
the hon. senator Roux - Roux ) 
the hon. Rose - Marie Cool - Cool :

the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , the leave is - she granted ? 
Dex Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Cool - Cool : 
the démographie of the needs in the of health is , without doubt , in evolution Increase . 
since 1997 , 40 per of the Canadians and of the Canadians seniors of to the least 30 years are the coping of to the least a member of their family . 
, the Canada , a adulthood happens , in average , more of years to soigner a parent that to rise a child . 
in they the of the fact of our people always ageing , he is time , honourable senators , that a initiative such this bill of bill be business to the Canada . 
today today , I like draw your attention on the clause 6 of this bill of bill , who is to coordinating , in cooperation with the authorities provincial and the associations of the professionals of the health , the to of lines guidelines national relatively to the forbearance and the interruption of the treatment of survival , to the treatment of the pain and to the care palliative , to promote and to encourage the education of the great public regarding the treatment of the pain by the ways medical and to improve the training of the professionals of the health in this who respect the treatment of the pain and the care palliative . 
honourable senators , he responsibility to the government federal of establish of the standards who board a quality of care palliative and that a accessibility to these care for all the Canadians and the Canadians who in have need . 
the care palliative should be into to the other services of health and idéalement , they should be California the same of a region to the other . 
as the has underlined the Dr. James McGregor , of the Ontario Palliative Care Association , during of the meetings of the committee Senate Special on the euthanasia and the assistance to the suicide , and I quote : 
he responsibility to the society , by the business of the government , of the presents of the care of health , of the agencies professionals and of the professionals of the health , of offer the resources necessary for ensure a system of support intensif to the intention of the unevenly and of their families . 
, this end , he must expand the sector of the care palliative of way to ensure that the skills The are easily available and need to all . 
he is unfortunate that of the Canadians and Canadians continue of die in the suffering because that they not have not access to these skills . 
honourable senators , the to of standards national in the of care palliative your to the needs of the more patients of our society . 
I like out the importance of the initiative of the senator Carstairs , who would for purpose of promote a approach intégrée and of to effective and need the services of care palliative to across the Canada . 
the care palliative are designed for answer not only to the needs physical but also psychological , social , Cultural , émotionnels and spirituels of each human and of his family . 
the care palliative help the people patients in end of life to live the time that he their rest in the comfort and the dignity . 
they are asset in end of life and to of the cycle more as of the illness . 
according a clause of the Globe and Mail The the 7 December 99 , four Canadians on five feel that the care to home should do part of a program of care of health gratuit and universal . 
the poll stated also that the quarter of the patients pay already of the costs has and that a patient on nine who has need of assistance not receives not of care to home , fault of resources financial . 
the most of the people who have answered to the poll have said that the quality of the care let to wanting , because the government has imposed of the line on the number authorized of p.m. of care gratuits and that they not had not the ways of the offer a assistance Supplementary . 
that said , we should nurturing and to need to the more great number possible of citizens of the care palliative of quality who purpose to their needs . 
I like quote as example the Dr. Ferguson , Leader of the program of Hospital extra - mural of the New - Brunswick , for illustrate the need of institutionnaliser the care palliative in the framework of the services of health to the Canada . 
I quote the Dr. Ferguson : 
in well of the provinces , the care to home the are développés more or least in the framework of a bill or of a program . 
home we , to the New - Brunswick , they are part of the system . 
we go believe that we we a approach different and we seek to do in so that they be used more effectively . 
is our objective , in all case . 
I am proud that my province of the New - Brunswick be in advance in the development of the care palliative to the Canada . 
I wish that with the support of the Senate and of the House of the Commons , we able adopt of such standards to across the country .

the business of the Senate 
point to the Rules - Ruling of the Speaker 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , before that we not emotions to the motion of adjournment , yesterday , I I invoqué the Rules with the senator Kinsella to the about of the acceptability of a report presented by a member of a committee who , seems he , not was not authorized to the do to the behalf of the committee . 
I had thought understand that His the they his decision that - that , because the committee of the Affairs foreign has already appear a meeting for discuss of the question formula in this report . 
I want me ensure that the point to the Rules is corrected before that this committee not entreprenne the study of a report who him has been referred . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , this who the snapshots to the within of the committees not provincial not of my jurisdiction . 
this are the committees them - same who decision of their operating . 
however , in this who respect the Presented of reports , I you veterinary to the ) 97 ( 1 ) , who said : 
the report of a committee particular must be presented by the chairman of the committee or by a senator appropriately by the chairman . 
when a report is presented , I not I not the power of me ask if the senator the showing has been appropriately for this do . 
I wish for learning that the chairman of the committee the has appropriately . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
the Exchange of yesterday with the senator Tkachuk , chairman - chairman of the committee , has revealed that the committee not had not appropriately the senator Hervieux - Hervieux for present the report . 
the hon. Leo E . Kolber : 
honourable senators , I devais present the report the week last , but . me has said of expect . 
I would could the do today today , but not yesterday . 
we stopped that he be presented yesterday . 
and , as I believe in have the right , I I responsible the senator Hervieux - Hervieux of the do . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
the Rules is very clear . 
this not is not the chairman of the committee who délègue this power , but the committee . 
the the just of quote the ) 97 ( 1 ) of the Rules . 
the the the Speaker : 
the Rules said that this is the chairman who must finding the replacement . 
I said the text of the clause : 
the report of a committee particular must be presented by the chairman of the committee or by a senator appropriately by the chairman . 
as the chairman has said that he had given the Authorized , the case 730 to my authority . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
honourable senators , I not want not delay the study of the bill of bill . 
I , my apologize to the senator Kolber for have suggested that the committee not had can - be not respected the Rules . 
the second question who had been raised was of know how transfer a report , during the Affairs offered , of the Senate to a other committee without that the Senate that the word to say in the the . 
if the senators prefers that I in about with the Speaker after these deliberations to that we can to to of other business to 15 p.m. 30 , I me would a happy of ask to the senator Hays of present the motion of adjournment . 
however , he is to my notice important that all the honourable senators are exactly the procedure followed and that she their be expliquée when she is for them , as this is here my case , source of confusion . 
the the the Speaker : 
if the honourable senators are loans to me listen , I will try of clarification the second part of the point to the Rules . 
the history has in the week last , and I I quoted the Journals of the Senate of the 24 November , regarding the decision taken by the Senate to the about of the bill of bill S - 3 : 
the bill of bill is then read the second time . 
the hon. senator Hays move , seconded by the hon. senator MLA , that the bill of bill be referred to the Committee Senate Standing of the Banking and of the trade . 
after debate , 
with the leave of the Senate and pursuant , clause 30 of the Rules , the motion is amended and the reads as following : 
that the bill of bill be referred to the Committee Senate Standing of the Banking and of the trade and to the Committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign . 
the motion , such that amended , implementation to the Senators , is agreed . 
honourable senators , this is that a procedure very unusual . 
he not between certainly not in the rules of the his of refer a same bill of bill to two committees . 
after all , how the there the - . for all to this result ? 
by therefore , if I I well including , the bill of bill has been referred to the committee Senate Standing of the Banking and of the trade . 
the committee the has examined and no amendment not has been proposed . 
the committee has presented a report to the about of the bill of bill . 
I must you refer to the ) 97 ( 4 ) of the Rules , who specific this who following : 
when a committee fact report of a bill of bill without amendment , obedience report is considered as adopted without no motion ; the senator who my the bill of bill move then that the third Reading in be made a other day . 
however , as I just of the read , the Senate had ordered the referred of the bill of bill to the other committee . 
and , a committee to fact report of the bill of bill without proposals of amendment , I I concluded that he not was not to to the third Reading of the bill of bill because that he was still be referred to the other committee . 
this is this that the Senate has decided . 
he had been provided of the refer to the other committee , and this is this that said the motion . 
I know how . would could act other to the about of the report the the of the decision taken by the Senate the week before . 
I had the hands related by the decision of the Senate of refer the bill of bill to two committees . 
I not see not how . would could act other for apply the decision of the Senate . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
he would been better , to the time of the Tabled of the report and to the call of the third Reading , that the Senate say , for be therefore with his decision : " - bill of bill not will not read a third time . 
we we decided of the refer to a committee . " 
I I had the Appendix that the Speaker has short - circuité the Senate . 
for some , this not is that a detail about , but I think that he any that he continues of to to the senators of determine this that he look of a bill of bill or of a report . 
I understand the situation in which the senators of the side first have the Honour the , since this are them who have decided of refer the bill of bill to two committees . 
the senator Hays has nothing the situation to the clear the second day . 
each time that the senators of the side first suggéreront of refer a same bill of bill to two committees , the honourable senators can be amorphous that we properly the first to we there against . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , since he we rest few minutes before of rise the sitting , and since this is me who am the author of this new procedure , a procedure who Much to my notice of very well operate , I like benefit of the opportunity for say few words to this about . 
I I fact the subject of criticism urgently of the share of my colleagues and of Honour the , and that of the share of the other author , could - I say , of this procedure , well that I doubt that he in accept the paternité . 
I want that the . understands well that the situation is unusual . 
however , the education given by the Senate is enough clear , of so that the Speaker the has well make . 
this is that where ahead the risk of confusion . 
the way which we , to the Senate , we tried of deal the problem , this was , to my suggestion , of provide in the order that the bill of bill be referred to the committee Senate Standing of the Banking and of the trade , this who has been fact , and that a time that this committee would debated the review , this who the is fact , the bill of bill be referred to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign for that he the examine to the turn . 
the solution agreed not will however not until to say how the Senate must the with of the question of manner to avoid the problem of procedure that this of the reports successive . 
the solution that we has proposed His the me believe good . 
the education to this regard must be considered as a order Special of the Senate proposed with the leave of the Senate 24 November and providing that , notwithstanding the ) 97 ( 4 ) of the Rules , the bill of bill is considered referred to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign . 
that respect exactly the education that the Senate has given to the two committees who have been law of examine the bill of bill . 
by therefore , honourable senators , I believe that this way of proceed is the better solution and that she will . 
I understand the concerns of the senator Lynch - Lynch and of other senators , who are that this way of do not be not acceptable . 
however , this is a solution that we we essayée . 
I not am not am that we the essaierons to new . 
what that he in be , of after this that I I said and this that His the has proposed for avoid the problems attracted by this case to the Senate , I believe that this way of proceed will . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I draw your attention on the clause EH of the Rules , who said : : 
the chairman of the committee must sign or parafer a copy printed of the bill of bill where the amendments are clear enrolled ... 
I know that this is the practice followed , but I not so not to find the clause of the Rules who said that a bill of bill which report is fact without proposals of amendment must also be signed . 
what that he in be , yesterday , the bill of bill is came not signed on the office of the Clerk . 
we we asked of the questions and he has been referred to the senator Hervieux - Hervieux , who the has signed . 
I me ask if the rule stated to the clause EH of the Rules , who said that the chairman of the committee must sign the bill of bill , the applies also to a bill of bill reported without proposals of amendment . 
the the the Speaker : 
for answer to the hon. senator Kinsella , I know the he there a clause of the Rules who the specific . 
of after this that I know , and this is the use , the chairman of the committee sign the bill of bill when he is tabled on the Board . 
I not see not the bills of bill when they are made . 
I am course that the Clerk check the they are signés . 
the they not the are not , I am course that the Clerk contacte the chairman of the committee . 
the senator Kinsella : 
the chairman of the committee was absent . 
this is therefore a other member of the committee who the has signed . 
the senator Kolber : 
honourable senators , I me will a happy of the sign . 
the senator Hays : 
the senator Kinsella has fact out this who is without doubt a chairman . 
the suggestion of the senator Kolber me believe good . 
the senator Kinsella : 
I is only to protect the rights of the minority in this place . 
the most of the chairmen of committee are of the senators owned to the party government . 
few - each are derogate of our side , all as the are of , the chairman - chairmen . 
in the absence of the chairman , this is the chairman - chairman who should act to his place . 
the senator Kolber : 
the clause EH respect a bill of bill who has been amended . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
we want fair that the senators of the party government respect the minority . 
the the the Speaker : 
he would without doubt useful that the Clerk specific the something and does a message to all the table of committees to of concerning any confusion . 
I like now to the question raised by the hon. senator Lynch - Lynch , who has said that he would favourite that be called the third Reading of the bill of bill . 
if we had fact that , we would achievement to the any of the decision of the Senate , according which the bill of bill was be referred to two committees . 
when a bill of bill is adopted without proposals of amendment , he not there has not of discussion . 
. must to directly to the step of the third Reading . 
which case , we not have not could refer the bill of bill which he question to the other committee , as the Senate in had decided . 
this is that the difficulty before which we we dealing . 
honourable senators , pursuant to the order of the Senate , as he is 15 p.m. 30 , I leaving the Chair .

the hon. Pat Carney : 
honourable senators , this week , a man who risk his life for help the people of the communities coastal of the British - British was in my office for ask the assistance of the government federal and of the Senate . 
Dan Edwards , a pêcheur of the Island of Vancouver , on the Coast west , in is to his forty - fifth day of extend of the hunger for draw the attention on our communities coastal who are devastated economically and socially by the collapse this year of the montaisons of salmon Red of the River Fraser . 
Mr. . Edwards has met the senators by Perrault etGerry Comeau and me - same for describe the frustration . 
all this that Dan written for to a term to his extend of the hunger , this is that the government federal negotiating with the government provincial and the stakeholders for find a way of come in assistance to the people of the communities who in have a need if Tisserant . 
until to now , the appropriation federal are for to people the people to leave the sector of the fishing and not to help the fishermen who are of the difficulties to the in out . 
honourable senators , he not there will not of fishing viable on the Coast west if all the fishermen to the skills and the experience necessary are forced of leave the sector of the fishing to the the of the program of buy . 
he must of the fishermen for have a fishing viable . 
the Auditor General is of agreed with Dan . 
in the report the more recent , he has fact referring regularly to the need of support a fishing viable . 
he has said : 
the challenge that must and the managers of the Department of the Fisheries and of the Oceans is to maintain the stocks current and to restore those who are low , all in now the viability of the fisheries . 
he will that the Department adapte the regime of management to of new realities and will the whatsoever and the support of the stakeholders the he to succeed . 
he has also underlined the need of : 
... solve the problems from to the consultation to of improve the reports with the stakeholders and of create any of the partnerships for share the responsibilities 2.4 to the management and cover the costs . 
this is this that Dan Edwards ask . 
until to now , the government federal not has of answer to the requests of assistance of the communities that the program of 400 million of $ announced the year last for do opposite to the crisis with the salmon coho will also of solve the problem of the salmon Red this year . 
seen that the regime of insurance - employment not assistance not the fishermen who not have not could fishing , force is to the fishermen aboriginal and not aboriginal of the in back to the assistance social . 
such is the situation in the communities where , this year , of the fishermen have invested , in some case , of the tens of thousands of $ in bombs of fishing and in costs of starts , and that , for a fishing who not has not had place . 
Dan represents a coalition baptisée Fraser oversees Sockeye Crisis Standing . 
she so the communities coastal who crient refer fault of assistance . 
Dan has lost 50 books since the beginning of the extend of the hunger . 
he is physiquement immortalized , but not has nothing lost of his determination . 
the senator by Perrault and me - same we exhorté Dan to not not to his days in danger , but he is resolved to not not eat before that someone a the interest to the case . 
well course , the government federal can negotiate with the province and the various stakeholders to of develop a plan to to provide a assistance of emergency to the people who live these communities of the British - British . 
the collapse of the sector of the salmon sockeye in the River Fraser is a disaster natural . 
he there of the practices to use in case of disaster natural to of help those who are price affected . 
they have been implemented in implement in Ontario and to the Quebec after the ice of ice . 
. has fact of same to the New - Brunswick in 1998 when the fish have been victims of a virus . 
I am that , the he so someone something to Dan Edwards , the situation régnant in the communities , who is already by , not become volatile . 
he we must show that we we the will policy necessary for solve this problem who one of the communities as aboriginal that not aboriginal , before that a tragedy human not the " on the Coast .

the Affairs Social , the Science and the Technology 
the bill of bill on the protection of the information personal and of the documents electronic - - Opposition of the government albertain 
the hon. Douglas Roche : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the chairman of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology . 
by the of the Exchange who has had place here , yesterday , to comments of the letter that the government albertain has reply , the 7 December , to the chairman of the committee , the government albertain me has informed today today that he not had not been guest to appear before the committee to the about of the bill of bill C - 6 . 
in any justice for the chairman of the committee , I must say that I believe that the government albertain not has not asked to appear , but has only sent a letter . 
he the is probably more here of a lack of communication that of bad will . 
however , the concerns albertaines regarding the meddling in of the areas of jurisdiction provincial two . 
when the chairman of the committee will the speak , today today , to the Senate , on the bill of bill C - 6 , will he to the concerns that the government albertain outlining in his letter ? 
the hon. Michael Kirby : 
honourable senators , I contend to the question of the senator Roche in showing two comments . 
all of first , as I the I explained yesterday , I thought that the government of the Alberta had been guest to appear before the committee , same if I I well taken be of say - and I just of read the Hansard - that I finish whether that with of the clerk of the committee . 
in fact , the government of the Alberta , contrary to the of the Ontario , not has not asked to appear before the committee . 
he we has submitted a memory - and we in we received a other he there has two days - but he not has not asked to appear . 
the committee has can - be fact a mistake in not invitant not the representatives of the province to appear , but they would certainly been the welcome as witnesses the they had asked to appear . 
of , , all the committees which I I chaired the business have always should a good reaction to the representatives of the governments provincial . 
the other problem , this is the who is of order constitutional . 
I not the speak not in my comments today today . 
I will maintain this that I I said yesterday , this is - to - say that the members of the committee have heard the evidence of experts who the have convinced that the bill of bill is consistent to the Constitution . 
we not we therefore not issue the question in our report , because that we believe that the bill of bill is consistent to the Constitution and that the evidence made to the committee abound strongly in the same sense . 
the Environment 
the announcement by the Alberta of the intention of Authorize the treatment of PCB dangerous imported to the centre of treatment of Swan Hills - - Position of the government 
the hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , the government of the Alberta has announced a amendment of his policy who has of the impact on the centre of treatment of Swan Hills . 
this amendment allows to the centre of treatment of Swan Hills of import and of deal of the PCB bruts , there including of the wastes and of other contaminants , that , without that a assessment environmental be necessary . 
honourable senators , the business who manages the centre of treatment of the PCB not has not a matter without tache . 
she has already been to the origin of fuites and of explosions and she has been appropriately found of pollution . 
she not has not out of important rejets of dioxine and of furane who the are products he there has several years - rejets who have caused of the problems of health to the people living in those and who have tainted the poissons and the wildlife . 
the business has been condamnée to a then of 625 $ $ for this offence . 
the States - United have , the importation of PCB products to the abroad . 
course , this change of policy of the government of the Alberta has of the impact who not the limit not to the Alberta since the PCB in question can be grid in Alberta by of other provinces , of other ports or there be come in truck , this who the in because the security and the health of the Canadians who live the long of these Ways of routing . 
after this announcement , the government of the Canada bad - he the need of amend his Position on the importation of PCB , of way general ? 
the Leader of the government can - he ask to the Minister of the Environment if she has asked the held of a assessment environmental federal ? 
she can the do because that not respect not only the province of the Alberta . 
course , the province she - same not for not of do a such assessment . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the decision Current to the treatment of PCB dangerous to the facilities of Swan Hills is now to the study by the government of the Alberta . 
the decision Current to the importation of Contents dangerous to the Canada must certainly be consistent to the standards Canadian in the of export and of importation of PCB dangerous , but she is when same of the resort of the province of the Alberta . 
in fact , of other provinces and territories importent now of the PCB of other country . 
I know what is , specifically , the Position of the Minister of the Environment to the regard of the assessment environmental which about the senator Spivak . 
I bring therefore his question to the Minister , who there will the week next . 
the senator Spivak : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the government to the Senate has said that the importation of PCB dangerous is of the resort of the provinces and that the transportation of PCB dangerous the is also . 
I not am not some of have well including the response of the Leader . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the regulatory of the export and of the importation of the PCB dangerous are a area of responsibility and of jurisdiction federal . 
these provisions will colleague in case of importation . 
the amendment of the licensing of and of the facilities in because for that they so deal of the PCB from of a other country is of the resort of the province , to my knowledge . 
the senator Spivak : 
honourable senators , the transportation interprovincial is subject to the regulatory of the export and of the importation . 
this is the transportation interprovincial of PCB who me interest . 
the Leader states he that this not is not a responsibility provincial , but a responsibility federal ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , for power import or flair pareils PCB , the facilities in because must the conform to the requirements for by the regulatory federal on the PCB dangerous . 
this regulatory includes of the provisions provisions to the health and to the security for the treatment of these PCB . 
the treatment to the within of the has she - same is authorized by the for of and that him has authorised the province . 
a sure number of provinces have , on their territory , of the facilities who importent of the PCB dangerous . 
the senator Spivak : 
honourable senators , the government of the Canada not lead - he not that we not devenions the Tabled of PCB dangerous of the world world ? 
he the is of products chemical who are of the dioxines and of the furanes . 
as in witnessing the laws that we we adopted recently , we seek to deals these marine and not to the import . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , he not fact not of doubt that the government of the Canada the inquiéterait of a scenario where we deviendrions the Tabled of PCB dangerous of the world world . 
the opinion of the Minister to this time - this is that the regulatory existante we will of deal this situation of way get . 
the agriculture and the agroalimentaire 
the crisis home the céréaliculteurs of the Western - Réponse of the government 
the hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate and the on the crisis that live the farmers . 
the negotiations of the Organization World of the trade to U.S. not have not given of the results positive . 
the Minister of the Agriculture , Lyle Vanclief , has little of hope that the céréaliculteurs Canadian grab soon a reduction of the grants international . 
I in am come to the same conclusion after me be ago with of the representatives of the Europe , of the States - United and of other country . 
the committee Standing of the House of the Commons has the of the hearings in the Western . 
I I attended to the hearings held to Estevan and to Regina . 
in fact , the Minister of the Agriculture of the Saskatchewan me has asked of the help to present a statement to the committee . 
the farmers , who are in a situation very precarious , looking , of way very émotive , the he there has someone a who the listening . 
I know that the committee of the House of the Commons listening , and very carefully . 
I was proud of the members members of this committee because that they have listened and seem have including . 
the Leader believes - he , in as that member of the cabinet , that the cabinet listening the farmers and the a screaming careful to their calls to the assistance then that they are in full crisis ? 
. has announced in all the Canada Mr. Milne , a member of the House of the Commons , would organizing a event for help the farmers , to Toronto . 
he is impossible that the people not understand not the crisis in the sector agricultural . 
the cabinet is - he to the listening ? 
the Minister is - he prepared to i the message from of this out - this ? 
of the speech on this about have been speeches by of the senators on of the side and they have been all also vigorous that those of this side - this . 
is - this that someone a listening ? 
the senator Ghitter : 
not , they not accolade not . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I I already fact share to the Minister of the Agriculture of the concerns expressed in the framework of our debate here , who been launched by the hon. senator Gustafson . 
. will seriously to the of the work of the committee of the House of the Commons . 
as the hon. senator the has said , the members of the committee not have not physically their efforts and all report fully of their work will taken , this is obvious , very to the seriously by the Minister and by his colleagues of the cabinet . 
. can hope that this report will presented in a deadline reasonable . 
the senator Gustafson : 
honourable senators , I I in with a release of press before that the program of fight against the crisis agricultural is a failure full and that the Ontario and the Saskatchewan the in gain . 
we not are that to few days of the next millennium , of the next generation , of the next century . 
we go speak of the crisis and we in discussing since a year and half . 
yet , . not has still presented no legislation who works . 
I not speak never out enough the serious of the situation . 
he is important that the Prime Minister , the Minister of the Agriculture and the cabinet accolade . 
I can say without fear of me wrong that the Senate has listened . 
I believe that the committee Senate Standing of the agriculture and of the Forestry has certainly answered of a way constructive . 
he the is now of know if the government will answer . 
this is this who any the more . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the hon. senator fact referring to two provinces who have said be insatisfaites of the programs current of protection of the income agricultural , but for of the ; well different . 
the government summer believer that the program not was not enough generous for his farmers and . can in déduire that he jugeait that a too great part of the appropriation had been RCMP , . 
the ministers federal and provincial of the Agriculture come all fair of to a meeting to Toronto . 
this question was to the order of the day and , to my notice , this is of that that come some of the statements . 
the Minister has agreed that the process should the continue and not not take end in same time that the conference . 
according me , the committee of the agriculture of the Commons could help of way positive and substantial to the discussion that place the government federal and the provinces . 
answers delayed to of the questions Oral 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I I of the answers to the questions raised to the Senate the 24 November 99 by the senators Tkachuk and Stratton regarding the cost of the program of registration of the weapons to fire and to a question raised to the Senate the 25 November 99 by the senator Forrestall to the about of the Alternative of the canoeing of helicopters Sea King and of his ask of a copy of the statement of the needs . 
the Justice 
the cost of the program of registration of the weapons to fire - - responsibility of the Minister 
( response to the questions raised by the sénateursDavid Tkachuk and Terry Stratton the 24 November 99 . ) 
the figure of 85 million of $ not is not the only estimate made by the Minister Rock . 
this figure is in fact addressed of the information that the Minister Rock has made to a committee of the House of the Commons in April 1995 . 
the documents in question thought the cost of the control of the weapons to fire for 5 years to 184 million of $ . 
Les85 million of $ were necessary for to the system in place . 
the rest covers the use of the former system ( C - 17 ) and the and of the new system . 
in a bill agreed by the Parliament in 1994 , of new components have been ajoutées such that the notice forwarded to the earnings and a audit tough of the background of the claimants of for . 
after that the bill after been agreed , but before that the system that been public and the in Bill , the provinces of the Alberta , of the Saskatchewan and of the Manitoba and that the Territories of the North - Western and the Yukon have announced that they not apply not the program in their Administration . 
all these events have fact grimper the costs of has and of implementation in Bill of the system . 
the Minister of the Justice states since 1998 that the costs of has and of implementation in Bill of the system who were be of 85 million of $ , are been à120 million of $ . 
with the implementation in Bill of the new systèmele 1 December 1998 , our obligations provisions to the former system have widely decreased , all as the costs of development and of implementation in Bill . 
finally , we feel that the costs ways of Administration from to the Act on the weapons to fire should be comparable to those of other systems of Administration national such that the Board of the passeports or the Board of the ownership independent of the Canada . 
we in are currently to the last steps of the negotiations with the provinces to the about of the Modèle of benefits of services who understands the Payments paid to the authorities by the government federal to the as of the costs administrative . 
the fact that we we had of the problems with the implementation in Bill is of the area public . 
we we asked to a home of experts - advice whose of do a study for we help to determine the reasons of our difficulties of enforcement and of the solutions possible . 
she has presented in June last a report who was of of problems from to the great number of mistakes in the requests sent for be treated by the system , to the ability of the system and to of the problems of productivity who people of our practices administrative . 
the report fact also that the problems met to the step of the implementation in Bill were normal for a business of this dispute . 
we we public a plan of action for answer to these difficulties . 
the funds accorded for the enforcement of the program people of the Approbation effective of the bills ( AEP ) of the Council of the Board , pursuant to his policy on the great bills of the state . 
, each year , between 1995 - 1996 and 1998 - 99 , the program has used the envelope the by the AEP . 
the resolution of the problems from to implementation in place of the program described this - that increase of many the needs debates to the Administration of the program to the over of the year 99 - 2000 . 
the Minister of the Justice and the Centre Canadian of the weapons to fire wish apply the program with success without overtake the line approved by the Council of the Board . 
of the funds deprive not can be octroyés to the program without the consent of the Council . 
all the parties wish that the program be exécuté of manner effective in despite of these constraint . 
the Defence national 
the Alternative of the canoeing of helicopters Sea King - - ask of copy of the statement of the needs 
( response to a question raised by the senator J . Michael Forrestall the 25 November 99 ) 
as the Minister the has mentioned to several occasions , the aircraft Sea King must be replaced . 
in fact , the Minister has confirmed that the an of the helicopters marine is his first priority in the of equipment and that a strategy of acquisition was in over of development . 
the statement of the needs not will not tabled to this time - this in this House . 
as the Minister the has indicated lines , in more of the statement of the needs , several questions must be examined and of other departments consulted . 
the Government will a announcement when these questions will résolues .

order orders OF 
bill of bill on the protection of the information personal and the documents electronic 
third Reading 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Kirby , seconded by the hon. senator Bryden , Honourable to the third Reading of the bill of bill C - 6 , Act to to facilitate and to promote the trade Ministerial in perpetuate the information personal collected , used or releases in some circumstances , in providing the use of ways electronic for to or put of the information and of the transactions and in amend the Act on the evidence to the Canada , the Act on the Statutory regulatory and the Act on the review of the laws , such that amended ; 
and on the motion of amendment of the hon. senator Murray , P , seconded by the hon. senator Doody , that the bill of bill not be not now read a third time , but that he be amended , to the clause 7 , to the page 7 : 
has ) by deleting of the lines 19 to 23 ; 
the hon. Michael Kirby : 
honourable senators , I like deal of the amendment to the bill of bill proposed yesterday by the senator Murray in the very plaisant statement . 
his roots NDP - écossaises of the Cape - Cape are well evident to each time that he the the speak to the Senate . 
I not I no the intention of égaler the ability oratoire and I me outline therefore of comment the further of his comments . 
this is many more easy . 
he has asked why our right to the protection of the information personal should the éteindre20 years after our death . 
as he the has underlined yesterday , that is a source of concerns for good number of people , particularly of the figures public as him . 
I know the senator Murray since long and I understand that he can be concern to this about . 
when this question has been raised to the committee , the members Liberal of the committee were convinced that the committee would mistake the he adoptait this amendment . 
we estimions that this would a mistake the given that we had heard relatively little of testimony to this about . 
that much with the amendment relatif to the sector of the health that we we adopted Tuesday to the step of the report . 
we we heard a great number of witnesses express their opinion to comments of this amendment . 
we we in effect heard a broad wide of witnesses of many p.m. during . 
as I the I said yesterday , in the of health , the committee was of notice unanimous that the amendment was be adopted . 
we are therefore delighted that the Senate the that adopted yesterday . 
the question that the senator Murray has raised yesterday was on the presence , in the bill of bill C - 6 , of a clause who has for effect of remove , 20 years after the Late of a human , the protection of the information personal assured by the bill of bill . 
during of the few evidence that we we heard on the about , . we has said that a rule similar of 20 years there in of other laws , which the Act on the protection of the information personal and the Act on the Archives national of the Canada . 
we we also heard that this not is not as if , in under of the bill of bill , . will automatically to all the requests of information regarding a human 20 years after the Late . 
as the the - speak of Industry Canada the have fact out in their testimony before the committee , the bill of bill not the not completely end to the right to the respect of the life privacy of a human 20 years after the Late . 
he allows the communication of information only to the for for which the data have been allow original , and only to the for for which the human would had to increase to this that . in the the Clinic for begin . 
we we also heard a expert in the of respect of the life privacy , Mr. Ian Lawson , who has supported a argument that or the senator Murray or me - same not had heard before , to know that he there a principle legal that that . not can do apply the rights of a human a time that she is died . 
the reaching Mr. Lawson was interesting . 
he the suggested on the argument that that . not can give the consent a time that . is who . 
that seemed Establishing a problem practice except , as the senator Murray and me the him we fact out , that this is to this time - that that between in stake the problem of the heirs and of the members of the family . 
or the senator Murray or me not we " many of negative to the testimony Mr. Lawson . 
a other witness expert on the protection of the information personal , Valerie Steeves , has fact a observation very interesting . 
well that she that before on this bill of bill before the House of the Commons and that she his before we , and well that she ruined since long in this bill of bill , until to this that the senator Murray addressed the question with she the week last , this question not him was never came to the spirit . 
. not the had never interrogée to this about . 
the question not had never been raised by the people which she has case . 
this not is therefore not , honourable senators , a question which the witnesses who have appeared before the committee have knowledge or to which they had thought . 
this is a clause who the find in of other laws , which the Act on the protection of the information personal . 
honourable senators , he has me to the majority of the members of the committee , which me - same , that , jointly to the work which I I spoke yesterday , regarding the need that the government entreprenne a strong review of the Act on the protection of the information personal to of the conform of manner effective to the provisions that is the bill of bill C - 6 to the sector private , a part of this study should clear include a review of the called rule of the 20 years and that that should be fact of way thorough and quickly . 
we we esteemed that in amend simply the bill of bill C - 6 and in leaving such what the various other laws federal , . characterized a double legislation of protection between the sector private and the government , who has already been in part created by the differences between the bill of bill C - 6 and the Act on the protection of the information personal . 
those of between we who the find of the side of the majority to the committee have favourite deal this question in a time . 
in of other words , the changes made to the Act on the protection of the information personal and to the Act on the Archives national of the Canada should the be in same time . 
honourable senators , this is the key note that I I to do to the senator Murray . 
I am of agreed with him on the question that he has raised and on the further . 
the majority of the members of the committee , which me - same , think that this is a question of calendar . 
she should be occasion when we parlerons of the changes to the Act on the protection of the information personal who should time . 
therefore , honourable senators , according me , this not is not the time of proceed to this amendment , same if the purpose of this amendment not me there no problem . 
this who me there problem , this is the choice of the time . 
I hope that we Working of new the question when , presumably , the Act on the protection of the information personal will before the committee under the pressure of this last , to the over of the next months .

speech of the Throne 
motion of Adopted of the Adresse in response - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator MLA , seconded by the hon. senator Furey , Honourable to the Adopted of a Adresse to His Excellency the Gouverneure general in response to the speech that her has given during of the opening of the second session of the 30 - sixth Parliament . - ( 7 
e day of the resuming of the debate ) . 
the hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , I I listened the speech of the Throne with attention . 
I am farmer , as the were my father and my great - father , and as the are my grandchildren - children , who constitute the fifth generation of farmers in our family . 
my great - father , who was came of Sweden in 1905 for the establish to the Canada as farmer , was very proud of be Canadian . 
I must say , in way of preamble , that we , the farmers , we are of the people proud . 
however , these the days , I I seen of the men pleurer , I the I were the unravelling , I the I heard say that he was démoralisant of have to the concern and to we explain their situation . 
the women , by against , have many least of difficulty to speak frankly of the situation by in which the find their family . 
I know that the honourable senators of in opposite have as me heard the farmers speak in committee of their problems and of the serious of their situation . 
I see that the hon. senator Joyce Fairbairn , who ' the chairman - Speaker of the committee of the agriculture , nodding of a sign of the head . 
this morning , we we heard the testimony of the producers of Wheat unkind of the Alberta , who have statement their problems . 
I not rise no happy to do this intervention today today . 
honourable senators , I unless that the government , the Senate and the House of the Commons , the Prime Minister of the Canada and the people Canadian not can ignore the serious crisis who department the world agricultural because she is a problem national serious for the country all world . 
she one not only the Saskatchewan , the Manitoba and the Alberta , but also the together of the country . 
the farmers the in graduate - they all if difficulty ? 
not , I wish to be all to fact clear and an to this about . 
the producers of products dairy and of volaille , and that of other , the in graduate very well and we not want not their ôter what that this be . 
in as that producers of grain , we we need of their support . 
the industry of the cattle the in fate very well . 
the producers of grain suffering many to because of the low price of the products of basic . 
the price not have never been also there . 
recently , I I persistent a are double of type B of Wheat to the silo of Weyburn . 
this not was not a good quality of grain . 
he had gelé for because of ensemencement tardif should to the time humide . 
this chargement of grain we has reported to the total 3600 $ gross . 
the amount of the cheque was of 1 400 $ . 
I him I said that he would receive a up . 
we go full of stories of this kind . 
the price of the grain has been very there . 
the price of the flax is still piece of 40 cents yesterday . 
the situation not is not also bad in Saskatchewan , where the income way is to the point the more there since 1933 . 
these figures people of the departments of the Agriculture . 
we we a serious problem on the gave . 
of the fact of the initiative of the government , not only the price of the products of basic has descended , but we know also of serious difficulties , including to the as of the rates of transportation of the goods . 
, again occasions , the farmers have indicated that the third of the income from of the sales of their grain was in costs of transportation of this grain to the abroad , because we are enclavés . 
we we heard this morning the producers of Wheat unkind of the Alberta , which have raised of important questions regarding the transportation of their grain . 
I i that some of these changes the imposaient . 
the elevator to grain of Macoum to been rasé to the bulldozer . 
I me trouvais to U.S. to this time - that and I am piece on my small - son . 
he has wanted know why I had left do that . 
the problem the a dimension affective , because in the Prairies , the people have the usual of see a silo - elevator all the nine miles ; they are part of the décor . 
, the seen of all that , of the changes the imposaient . 
I am of agreed . 
however , these changes would could be drew very differently . 
I not want not embarrass the debate , and yet I must remind some of the programs the in place by the government Conservative for protect the farmers . 
he there has had the Plan of insurance - income gross , which the benefits have been benefit for we . 
this is the senator Hays , if I not me read , who me has repeatedly to again occasions in committee that we should we atteler to the réactualisation of these programs of protection of the income . 
our program not was not perfect , but we must we defray of programs similar to long term for go of the before . 
we are can - be all to blame , in a some legislation . 
we we had few good years to the over made we not we are not many souciés of the problem and , well heard , the something the more important was of juguler the deficit of the time . 
I believe that we recognize all that we were in are of losing the control of the deficit . 
however , some measures that we we out of take to the regard of the agriculture would for of avoid of we on in the situation where we are today today . 
honourable senators , that me brings to the program ACRA . 
the government has the many of money in this program , but he not works not . 
we we heard say to again occasions that he not operated not . 
I can appoint of the farmers who have received of the money , but who not would not should in receive . 
he must reform this program in full . 
I believe that he is obvious for all that this is necessary . 
, my notice , a injected direct of capital would given of good results , and this is the opinion position by of the farmers to Regina and to Estevan during of the meetings which I I attended . 
that would could take the form of a payment to the acre . 
, what point these needs are - they pressants ? 
he there has a serious crisis and the - this system of the problems social . 
some case are too tragic for be racontés . 
of the people are came explain their situation during of meetings and have move in sanglots . 
according some people , until to 15 suicides would directly account to the crisis agricultural . 
the farmers are of the people very proud .

the hon. senator Kenny ) . 
the hon. Colin Kenny : 
honourable senators , I rise the speak today today for speak of the motion of the senator Nolin to to form a committee Senate Special for reassess the laws and the political Canadian antidrogues . 
he is great time of review our strategies current of fight against the consumption of Substances . 
honourable senators , he is obvious for we all that the attitude of the Canadians to the regard of the political antidrogues and of their results has changed . 
the Canadians are of more in more many to recognize that the political current not limited not the results souhaités . 
of the are of money important are net in the application of the laws antidrogues , but the problems social and the problems of health from to the drug continue of ceased and taking same of the magnitude . 
the creation of a committee Special responsible of the broad mandate who is proposed would the way ideal of consult the public . 
that would to define the needs own of the various regions . 
of the legal and of the doctors experts commend a strategy antidrogue who é the of the aspects legal , of the problems of health and of the questions financial . 
honourable senators , he the is of a question burning . 
more of a year the is already has since that Diane Riley has presented , in November 1998 , the report on the Substances and the policy on the Substances to the Canada , report that she has prepared for the senator Nolin . 
the time is come of canvassing the opinions of the Canadians , of see what are their values and of take in the the costs and the benefits of the political existing . 
the information on of the approaches and models different modern to the abroad would to choose the political to develop for the Canada . 
the questions legal , the problems of health and the concerns financial who the reformed to the consumption of stupéfiants the multiplient and than constantly in grow . 
as he the is of a question sensitive , the governments have too often trend to the éluder . 
this attitude not is not in the interest of the Canada and of his citizens . 
the first recommendation of the report Riley to that he there that a inquiry on the policy Canadian in the of Substances and on his relations with the right within and international , there including the standards provisions to the rights of the human . 
the inquiry must also to on the political and the programs of other country in the the . 
since the Tabled of the report , he not the is fact no inquiry . 
the senator Nolin we has all the service in we made that the consumption of stupéfiants there of important problems are we must we interest . 
he we must a information sure to the about of the consumption of Substances to the Canada . 
as a committee Special of the Senate would the power of question of the witnesses , of from the production of documents and of receive of the you and of the evidence , the report final would a source definitive of information objectives . 
a committee Special could offer the point of view , the analysis , the reflection necessary for find of the solutions possible to the problems that pose the consumption of Substances and the political antidrogue to the Canada . 
needless of say that the government the interest criticized to the results of a study as the - that , and this is for the Senate a excellent opportunity of play a role of Prime plan in this very important matter . 
honourable senators , I you urge to support the motion of the senator Nolin to creation of a committee Special responsible of study the question of the use of Substances illégales to the Canada .

the freedom religious in China in report with the pactes international of the Nations Nations 
inquiry - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the inquiry of the hon. senator Wilson , calling the attention of the Senate on the freedom religious in China in report with the pactes international of the Nations Nations . - ( 
the hon. senator Nino Nino ) . 
the hon. Consiglio Nino Nino : 
honourable senators , as this is tomorrow the Day of the rights of the man , I wish to participate to the debate on this inquiry . 
this is with happy , in fact , that I at to the debate on the inquiry of the senator Wilson on the freedom religious in China . 
I like benefit also of the opportunity for comment of the comments that has made the senator Austin , as on this about that on the question closely of the situation of the rights of the human in China . 
his hosts Chinese have should many the sustains . 
I I been rather mystifié , however , by his comments regarding the group witty Falun Gong , which I speak a little more in a moment . 
the senator Wilson has said that his " partners church " , who are the Églises determined , I i , consider the Falun Gong as a organization foreign to the influence déstabilisante and dangerous . 
I not see not on what the based this deal rather hardie . 
I not I certainly nothing seen who can me to to a such conclusion . 
as not the know without doubt not the senator Wilson , the Constitution Chinese guarantees the freedom of belief . 
why therefore his partners church and , therefore , she - same , I there , taking - they the Falun Gong to part ? 
is - this because this is a of the five religions official of the China ? 
that me décevrait . 
I would thought that the senator Wilson , the the of the importance to the within of his community religious and of the experience country , would more tolérante . 
in way , I I read this morning that he there would 30 million of Christian Chinese who now each day of be Farmers , sought or emprisonnés by the authorities Chinese . 
he seems that they not the their not in of the site of culte approved formally . 
he would interesting of know if the senator Wilson or his colleagues have asked the question to their hosts during their visit in China . 
honourable senators , before that we interrompions our business for our making of been , the senator Austin the in is taken to me for some comments that I had made to the about of the respect of the rights of the human in China . 
he said in biggest that I cherchais too the confrontational and that we should be more conciliants with the Chinese . 
in of other words , we should close the " on some abuse made that - there . 
he is obvious that I not then be of agreed with that . 
this is a well a picture , but he not is not completely true . 
honourable senators , our relations with the China are based on three major consistently . 
he there has all of first the Immigration . 
I I had my first contacts with the China and the Chinese to the end of the years 50 , then that I was a young banquier in the Headquarters Chinese of Toronto . 
, the over of the years , I I touch of the contacts with various members of the community Chinese and I can say without hesitation that their presence has helped to promote the encouraged of our country . 
the Canadians of origin Chinese Whelans a enormous contribution to the Canada . 
they working durum and this are of the citizens honest and slips . 
they élargissent and by our culture . 
the Canada is the great it for this who is of the Immigration Chinese . 
however , . not can not say , according me , that the same something the applies in the case of the second track of our relations with the China , the Affairs and the trade . 
in the years before 1993 , these relations were relatively stable . 
the trade commercial were to little close équivalents . 
if I not me read , they were of the order augmented billion of $ by year of each side . 
all that has changed when the government present is came to the power . 
since 1993 , the taxpayers Canadian are forced of firms , to the of million of $ , and . know the figure exactly , the attempts made Mr. tien and his colleagues of increase the presence of the Canada in China and our opportunities on the market Chinese . 
the results are surviving , this is the least that . can say . 
in fact , since this period , the value of the exports Canadian to the China has falling regularly then that the value of the worth has more that doubled . 
in fact , she has virtually triplé , except mistake . 
the third track of the reports that we involvement with the China respect the role that the Canada has traditionally played as this of the rights of the human . 
, a time , honourable senators , the governments Canadian favorisaient of the values and of the fight who were the envy of the world . 
unfortunately , as we the know all , this not is not the case when he is question of the China . 
now , we not are more that a other group of people of Affairs who at to obtain of the markets . 
we not défendons absolutely more the idea that he should there have a link between the rights of the human and the trade . 
the Prime Minister tien said that our country has a too small size for influer on the China . 
Mr. . tien we said that he is a great friend of the leaders Chinese . 
why not the well - he not of this friendship ? 
our best friends to the world are the citizens of the States - United of America . 
our small size not we from not of the criticize . 
we the do continually . 
why not can - we not act of the same way to the place of the China ? 
why aside this treatment Special to the government Chinese ? 
why the government Chinese the - he as to forward his Criminal to stay to the within of the boundaries of the country ? 
honourable senators , the been last , few weeks after that the senator Austin that given to the House the insurance that the China had changed for the better , the government Chinese has appréhendé more of 30 $ of his citizens . 
since this time , he has sue the arrests . 
for what crime ? 
according the government Chinese and , I the i , according the partners church of the senator Wilson , this is because that they adhèrent to the movement witty Falun Gong , which I I spoke he there has few minutes . 
in more of appréhender all these people , the government has ordered that more of 1.5 million of cassettes , of brochures and of other sections from to the movement be confisqués or spawning . 
he there has same had of the autodafés of books . 
honourable senators , he is someone little difficult of the imagine that he can there have of the autodafés of books to the enter of the third millennium . 
of the books have been brûlés during the " and that under the regime premier . 
the communistes Chinese seem now have added their behalf to this short but however occasional list , and the senator Austin what that of progress . 
honourable senators , in me s on the question of the rights of the human , I not I happened the intention of diaboliser the Chinese . 
I believe firmly that the Chinese , those who are IT , are also horrifiés of see this who the what in their country . 
my comments improve therefore the government and not the people Chinese . 
the Prime Minister said that we not we no influence . 
why then the government continues he of Zion to the world world the importance of the rights of the human ? 
this is the a of his objectives basic . 
the rights of the human not are - they not part of the policy foreign of the Canada ? 
that seems obvious . 
the note said also a document entitled : " - Canada in the world " . 
according this document , the Canada can to a important cooperation to the security international in by the promotion of the values Canadian , this who includes the respect of the rights of the human , of the democracy and of the law of the right . 
why not the do - we not in the case of the China ? 
why not do - we not the promotion of our values in this case ? 
he seems that the . not does not speak of other something that of the meetings to senior level and to camera closed , of the symposiums multilateral , of the initiatives of cooperation and of the bills of dialogue . 
if the government believes that the freedom of religion and the rights of the human are of the pillars of our policy foreign , he should the say to all the world without exception . 
he should shown by his actions that he has the courage of his convictions . 
why the Prime Minister not the " he not before the representatives of the world for criticize the occupation of the Tibet or the persecution religious of the Falun Gong in China ? 
the constraint trade are - they if strong or the itself - saying links of friendship with the leaders Chinese if low ? 
the hon. senator Wilson we said that his partners church of China are of notice that the Falun Gong is a threat to the stability of the China . 
this is strange . 
the bouddhistes not are not a threat , the Catholic and the protestants not more , and he seems that or the each or the other not believe to the Prophète or to those who looking the Aristotle of the taoïsme . 
he not there has that the members of the Falun Gong . 
honourable senators , Monday of this week , the chairman American , Mr. Clinton , contrary to the counterpart Canadian , has fact a statement to this about . 
he has described the diversion within of the members of the Falun Gong as 
... a example disturbing of a legislation government to the any of people who while test the line of the freedom . 
and he has added : : 
the targets of the government Chinese not are not of the dissidents political , and we know their practices and beliefs . 
but the principle not in remains not least the same : freedom of conscience and freedom of association . 
I specific that the comments Mr. Clinton s in the same sense that the point of view expressed the months last by the two Houses of the Congress American . 
in effect , in a resolution concurrente , the House of the representatives and the Senate have exhorté the China to stop of persécuter the movement Falun Gong . 
the resolution was point to fair as that the shut of the secte Falun Gong taxing the own Constitution of the China . 
that is also contrary to the Covenant international relatif to the rights civilians and political and to the Declaration Universal of the rights of the man . 
honourable senators , to the time where the Canadians are on the point of saluting the end of the Hanukkah and the prepares to the ë , we should all reflect to the values fundamental that are these traditions . 
the brings of the Lumières , the birth of the Christ and the other celebrations of the kind we recall that he there has of the values transcendantes that all the men shared and place . 
these observe we recall that he there has in the world of the places where these values are provided and the people human who the professent , persecution . 
the time is help , I believe , for those of between we who goûtent the fruit of the freedom and of the democracy of prier for our similar who not have not this opportunity . 
in our prayers , honourable senators , we should also ask that the government reprenne his spirit and the of the Canada the great are of the rights of the human across in the world .

this is to the senator who give notice of a inquiry that up the privilege of in speak in Prime . 
the senator Gauthier not the is not still given on this about . 
to for learning that if a other human has spoke of this inquiry which we not know nothing , that has for effect of bring to zero the number of days recorded to the Paper would create a dangerous precedent . 
: said , if we vote unanimous of bring this figure to zero , in despite of the fact that the senator Gauthier not has not still fact the inquiry , this is a other case , and I accepterais that we tarred of the so . 
the senator Kinsella : 
I support to the interpretation and to the board of the senator Corbin . 
I think that he has fully reason and I am all to fact of agreed with him . 
my analysis was erronée .

the rights of the human and the conflict multiethniques 
inquiry - adjournment of the debate 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) , to given notice the 6 December 99 : 
- honourable senators , such is the about which I want speak . 
the the of the time , I presenting a version abrégée of my comments . 
if I want speak today today of this question , this is that the senator Andreychuk has fact know , in the statement that she has introduced to the beginning of the , sitting , that tomorrow , the 10 December , is the Day international of the rights of the man . 
the senator Nino Nino has also brought that to our attention when he has taken the speak all to the time . 
the Day international of the rights of the man , the 10 December , is a day important for the community international . 
as the Canadians overwhelmingly enormous of importance to the rights of the human , he is , I believe , that we , of the House high of the Parliament , pasts all am of the Declaration Universal of the rights of the man . 
he is also important that we rappelions that a distinguished Canadian has participated to the drafting of the Declaration Universal of the rights of the man who has been proclaméele 10 December 1948 by the Assembly general of the Nations Nations . 
this fall , to the UN , in a report that he has presented to the Council of security , which the Canada is currently a member permutant , the present Secretary General , Kofi Annan , has spoke of the protection of the civilians to the over of the conflict armed . 
the Secretary General has said that , in despite of the Adopted , to the over ratio last years , of various conventions on the rights international , humanitarian and human , he not the what to little close not a day without that of the civilians innocent be confiscation , brutalisés , torturés and killed in of the conflict armed . 
that he the whether of mutilations to the Sierra Leone , of genocide to the Rwanda , of purification ethnic in the Balkans or of disparitions in America Latin , the parties to of the conflict own was these conventions on the rights human . 
honourable senators , the end of the War Cold has can - be journey the world of the threat of a War nuclear his . 
in same time , however , since the further of the ripe of Berlin , more of 4 million of people have been driving in of the conflict violent and he rest of the million of refugees and of people displaced in the world world . 
the events s in the Balkans and , in this only decade indicate to what point he is none of the deal to the complexités of the conflict multiethniques modern . 
in same time , we are horrifiés by the were events who are s to the Rwanda in 1994 . 
we recognize that these issues are extremely complex . 
as the Secretary General the has also fact out , we was that the keeping of the peace and of the security international require a intervention to all the steps of a conflict or of a conflict requires , to of the avoid , of in minimize the consequences and of there to a term a time that he has began , or in view of wasn the keeping of the peace and the contribution of the peace , there including the reconciliation and the Administration of the justice , a time the conflict debated . 
the Canada at drew to these interventions international , and we are proud that our country and the Canadians so to of the contributions of this kind . 
all these actions are important . 
he must back in question the one ideas , there including the concept of law of the sovereignty of the States and of the integrity land . 
as the has supported , in September , the Secretary General Annan : 
of the concept of sovereignty strictly traditional not can more to justice to the aspirations of all the Peoples of access to their freedoms fundamental ... 
of the abuses massives and systématiques of the rights of the human , where that they so the produce , not should not be tolérées . 
honourable senators , the community international must recognize that , with the end of the War Cold , the security of the people , this who includes their rights human , becomes more important that the security of the States . 
today today , . not there more that the right international would a more great priority to the sovereignty of the States and to the integrity land that to the rights of the human or to the autodétermination . 
honourable senators , I believe that do of the protection of the rights of the human the Prime principle of the relations international help greatly to avoid of the conflict multiethniques and to promote a democracy and a peace best . 
we must go beyond - beyond of the principle of the sovereignty of the States , who has dominé the relations international until to this day . 
we must to to the principles of the Declaration Universal of the rights of the man and to those of the conventions and of the treated international on the rights of the human who have been élaborés to the the of the Declaration Universal and who the in analysis . 
honourable senators , unfortunately , force we is of recognize that the country have often , to the over of the decades , misses to the commitments enrolled in these instruments debates to the rights of the human . 
the senior - Commissioner of the Nations Nations to the rights of the man , Mary Packwood , former chairman of the Ireland , has admitted in a statement that she has fact the that of the fiftieth anniversary of the Nations Nations the year last that : 
when . fact the the of 50 years of implementation in place of instruments debates to the rights of the man and of 30 years of programs of development of several billion of $ and of speech of senior level , the results not are hardly biodegradable ... 
this is a such failure that we should have shame . 
as the senior - Commissioner to the Nations Nations of the rights of the man , Ms Packwood , has added : 
in this who respect the to of standards , the work is fact in great part . 
the standards international in this who respect the rights of the man are in place . 
the task for we all ... is of the apply .

Affairs Social , Science and Technology 
motion to Authorized to the committee of study the of of the system of health - Adjourned of the debate 
the hon. Michael Kirby , to given notice Tuesday 28 October 1986 : 
that the Committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology be authorized to examine , for in do report , the of of the system of health to the Canada . 
more particularly , that the committee be authorized to examine : 
has ) - principles basic on which is based the system public of health to the Canada ; 
d ) - system of health to the Canada - pressure and constraint ; 
e ) - role of the government federal in the system of health to the Canada ; 
that the Committee , the report final to the more later the 14 December 2001 ; and 
that the Committee be authorized , by derogation to the rules usuelles , to table all report with of the Clerk of the Senate if the Senate not seat not to this time - that ; and that the report be being have been tabled to the Senate . 
this mandate has received the approval unanimous of the members of the committee . 
this study has for subject basic of take act of the changes important on the point of speak in the system of care of health for various reasons , including the evolution demographics , the innovations generic and technological , and the expectations new of the Canadians regarding their rights in the of care of health . 
the members of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology feel that this is probably , on the plan social , the question strategic the more important and also the more cause in our country . 
the impact of the costs from to the care of health are such that the system present not will very probably not viable on the plan economic in a future result . 
the members of the committee want about a series of studies who would all related to of the studies which préalablement , of by their about and according their progress logical . 
we want offer a gallery where the . can discuss , of a manner general , of the policy Canadian of the care of health in the years to come and , more particularly , of the role of the government federal . 
we hope also , with the time , power develop a series of recommendations strategic to the intention of the government federal , recommendations regarding the role in the system of care of health . 
if the Senate does this mandate , the committee steering élaborera , in January , a plan of work detailed who will submitted to the members of the committee , then to those of the committee of the Economy Economy . 
the hon. Consiglio Nino Nino : 
honourable senators , then - I question few questions ? 
the chairman has he consulted the Minister of the Health to this about ? 
the case if , can - he we do share of the results of these consultation ? 
the senator Kirby : 
if I had consulted the Minister of the Health and that he me had déconseillé of do this study , I me would found in a situation sensitive . 
if the motion is unequivocally and that a plan of work is public , I be happy of me speak with the representatives of the Department . 
I not I not spoke of this question to the Minister or to no representative of the Department . 
the senator Nino Nino : 
honourable senators , the questions of health chevauchent of the sectors of jurisdiction federal and provincial . 
the chairman has he the intention of cooperate with the provinces or of coordinating the efforts been by the different levels when come the time of being the business future of the committee ? 
the senator Kirby : 
honourable senators , I am to answer , because the study would represents on the role of the government federal in the area of the health . 
in this wish , he would desirable of discuss with of the ministers provincial and of the representatives of the provinces and of hear their evidence . 
the committee not has absolutely not the intention of the immiscer in the questions of jurisdiction provincial . 
we want determine what changes he would to to the policy federal current . 
the senator Nino Nino : 
honourable senators , the care of health matters primarily of the provinces and of the territories . 
the patients are directly and primarily affected by the provinces . 
I me ask how this type of study can be chosen without the cooperation serious of those who fournissent the services of health to the public . 
he must well understand how these roles can change in the future structure of the care of health . 
the senator Kirby : 
honourable senators , I am fully of agreed with the senator Nino Nino . 
I répondais to his first question when I I said that the committee entendrait the witnesses of the governments provincial . 
all as the reason who me value to not not speak to the Minister of the Health before the approval of this study by the Senate , we do attention to not not have the air of approve or of adopt the referred of a question to a committee Senate on the basic of a veto of the governments provincial . 
of other share , the government provincial and of many other organizations are of the meeting to share full in these questions and we wish the consult during the process . 
the senator Nino Nino : 
honourable senators , I not wish not extend this debate . 
that characterized - he a problem to the committee if I ajournais this debate until to this that I can obtain the comments of the members of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology ? 
the senator Kirby : 
honourable senators , he there would a problem if the motion not was not unequivocally before the adjournment of ë . 
if the Senate does this mandate , we we the intention of work in January to the development of a plan detailed . 
I not will not this effort if we not we not the approval . 
the senator Nino Nino : 
I not créerai not of behind . 
I like add someone something . 
we entreprenons many of studies and of business in committee without that he there that of debate to the Senate or with very little of debate . 
and , when we deducted per $ $ or more , he must that the Canadians who the wish so know of what he not in read our deliberations . 
this is very widest . 
by therefore , if you not you not of objection , we we pencherons on the question the week next and I move the adjournment of the debate . 
the hon. Nicholas W . Taylor : 
honourable senators , I thank the senator Kirby of have the this idea of the before because that this is someone something that the Senate can do and for which he is qualified . 
I thank also the senator Nino Nino of have raised a idea to which I had thought , to know that he not would not needless of to the focus on the provincial as that on the federal . 
I say that the idea of the senator Kirby of not not ask the leave pre to the ministers of the Health of afraid of essuyer a refusal is good - and I about in knowledge of because after have high nine children who have all used this strategy . 
I know very well how this strategy works and she seems operate . 
in our system of health public , the part private , by example , the offices of doctors , is always a some importance . 
if the committee in had the time , he could the look on the reports between the private and the public . 
as the honourable senators the know , this is a question very cause . 
the senator Kirby : 
honourable senators , I say that that will certainly a question that we Working in detail . 
addition the fact that this is enough obvious , when . analysis the questions related to the questions Social which the country is such , the question of know if the system of health present is really sustainable is the question essential . 
this is this who we has stampeded to enter in the debate . 
however , he there has three or four weeks , the government of the Alberta has fact a statement of principle on the construction of hospitals private to Calgary . 
my reaction personal to the Reading of this statement of the government of the Alberta , this is that I I found this proposal all to fact consistent to the Act Canadian on the health . 
I the say in despite of the comments very émotifs of a myriad of people to the any of the proposal of the Alberta , there including of the people of the other place . 
be said in way , Lueders number of these people - that argue , in their protests , that the proposal of the government of the Alberta not is not consistent to the Act Canadian on the health . 
he me seems that if we must to a debate on any the question of the system of health , he is to all the least of the Corrections on of the facts and on the reality . 
this is why I think that we must we look on the question of the sector private . 
I am all to fact of agreed . 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , to the risk of me repeat astre nauseam , I must express my concern as to the fact that the . ask to the Senate that he give card one to a committee . 
I not I nothing against the subject of the study , but this is and that the . welcomes for all the requests of the committees when he the is of studies who are also complex , détaillées and requisite that the - this . 
this study will a year and half , even more , because she could be constitutes for of the reasons valid . 
the senator Nolin has asked the Authorized of to a study who will to the least three years , without same present of plan of work General or of budget . 
how will this study to the Senate ? 
still a time , honourable senators , I think that we on the hub before the boeufs . 
we giving the Authorized , after what , the committee of Economy Economy , including , must the machine for find the funds , the staff and all the rest . 
the good way of proceed for a committee would , of first , of establish the budget , of define the mandate and of draw the term of the study . 
for my share , I find that this way of proceed is better to the where the . give card one to the committee without the concern of this that that will and of the time that that will . 
the hon. Colin Kenny : 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
not , I not I not fact that . 
the senator Nino Nino : 
honourable senators , I not believe not that this be that a question valid . 
I believe understand that , according the senator Lynch - Lynch , he we must review the process that we we followed until to now for see if we could the improve in require , before of approve the study , of have to the least a idea of the cost . 
without that , he the could that we we dealing to approve a study which the cost final the élèverait to 40 million $ , that we not we not . 
I believe that the note of the hon. senator is very valid . 
I hope convince my colleagues , of the least those of this side - this who are members of the committee Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology , of reflect also to this question , in will that we able have a discussion met to this about the week next . 
I not want not defeat the debate , but I be happy of propose the adjournment , to least that someone a of other not whatever take the speak . 
the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I me find to be of agreed to the time with the senator Lynch - Lynch and with the senator Kenny , same if their were are diamétralement contradictory . 
I will you explain why . 
the Rules of the Senate of the Canada not allows not to a committee of ask of the money before that the mandate not that been approved . 
I am of agreed with the senator Lynch - Lynch for say that we do the things to the to , this is - to - say that before of Authorize a committee to do a study , we should have a idea of this that she will . 
this is exactly why , when I I fact my ask , - I believe that this was he there has two weeks - I I given a Senate a plan of work and indicated the cost approximatif of this plan of work . 
incidentally , this budget has been submitted this morning to the committee of the Economy Economy , who the has markers of half . 
the committee of the Economy Economy believed - and he the find that I am of agreed with him on this point - that he not had not a enough good idea of this that the other committees réclameraient ; he has therefore decided of be the amounts budget step by step . 
according me , we we raised this after - afternoon a problem as to our Rules and to our procedures . 
the senator Kirby has presented to the behalf of the committee a ask of study special that all the members of this committee have seconded to the unanimously . 
he was therefore the present before the Senate , pursuant to our Rules present , for before the Senate of this proposal and obtain the leave deal before of power then prepare a budget before be referred to the under - committee responsible of the Budgets and , in end of the , to the committee of the Economy Economy . 
I not am not in disagreement with the Position of the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
in fact , I am of agreed with him and we we already had of the discussions to this about in the past because this is , according me , the way which we should proceed . 
the senator Kenny : 
honourable senators , I not see really nothing of difficulty in the provisions current of the Rules . 
I not believe not that the committee of the Economy Economy should decide for we on what studies or interpellations we can we look . 
I not find nothing to repeat to the model proposed by the senator Carstairs , this is - to - say that the committee give a estimate general of the costs of the study . 
he the is in amount of a process in two steps . 
if the approval not just not of a side as of the other , the study not the will not . 
the first step is to obtain the approval of the Senate . 
the second is of the address to the committee of the Economy Economy in the hope of obtain the resources financial The . 
if the Senate refuses the approval , needless of the address to the Economy Economy . 
if the Senate give the those , while that the Economy Economy not has not of what fund properly the study , the committee is private of ways and not can wasn the study . 
he would without doubt possible to the chairman of before the Senate of the problem and of in call of the report of the Economy Economy , this that all senator is in right of do . 
I believe by against that he is difficulty of the address of first to the committee , who can do barrier to the bill .

the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , not more later that the week last , I me am ago with our colleague Jim raise , which the Late provide in the night of Sunday we has all affligés . 
he was as he has been during any his life - a life would by more of a tragedy personal - , this is - to - say stoïque , energetic and , by - that all , honourable . 
he is death to the the of a long illness , who has need of the treatment difficult and evolving , without for as enter his will of live . 
never I not the I heard the concern or same show of the warning of découragement , then same that he knew that all the interventions medical the avéreraient outlive . 
I it to of other , more competent that me , the be of do the he of his proceed career , as privacy that public . 
this who me frappait home him , this were the hyphenate makes who were of him a esteemed colleague and friend . 
loyalist , he and committed , he was always prepared to sit when the vote was required , to the backs of obligations personal urgent , and always sorry when the illness the they of take share to the business of the House . 
how of time him has . said of do to his health in Prime place and how of time not in has he nothing fact ? 
still the year last , during a period of she , then that the cancer seemed have been beat , he has agreed with enthusiasm the Speaker of the under - committee of the Affairs of the former Veterans , when the senator Phillips has taken his retirement . 
he believer that in this role , he could help to the improvement of the conditions of life of those and those who have served their homeland . 
he has always late that the things the be through if crudely . 
that this be to the caucus , to the House or to the within of a committee , his interventions were always big with many of attention because his wisdom and his logical managed a sad particular to all debate . 
being course , this is he the experience and the knowledge and know the apply judicieusement . 
and in was - he of Jim , also well to the Parliament in as that member distinguished that home him as faithful friend . 
certainly , he there has someone peerage to think that this deuil is shared by few - each , but that not reduced in nothing the had of our loss . 
I offer my sincere sympathy to his family . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I by , with my colleagues , the would of the senator Jim raise . 
the senator raise was a of my friends , as he the was for many of between you . 
I I many appreciate Jim raise and the incredible experience which he has fact benefit this House in as that lawyer , man of Affairs , former member federal and senator . 
through to the experience , he was able of go to the heart of the problems and of do a enormous contribution to the good government of the Canada , : by the through of the Senate . 
I not I not fact part of the under - committee with him in this ability , but I I observers the senator raise in the role of chairman of the under - committee responsible of examine the questions of the Defence national , including the role of keeping of the peace that role the Canada in the world . 
in 1993 , the committee that he chaired has tabled in this place a report who meeting absolutely of the prescience . 
he identifiait of the points who , if . the there was attacked then , would for of avoid a great number of the problems are the are heurtés our efforts of keeping of the peace these last years . 
the senator raise learned his family . 
I the know because that we were friends , and to because of the many discussions that we we face during the illness of the wife and of other events familiaux , which some tragic . 
the senator raise , the good sense and his into we miss enormous . 
I me join to the honourable senators for address to his family my very sincere sympathy . 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , that fact 38 years that Jim raise and me are friends . 
think to his life and to his death up to so on the courage and the tolerance . 
in 1958 , to the age of 30 years , Jim raise has lost the unique brother to the outcome of a long and douloureuse illness . 
in 1990 , Jim and his woman Jane have lost their more young son of way tragic . 
in 1994 , Jane is died of a long illness who the had strongly affaiblie . 
in 1996 , Jim has received of his doctors a pronostic providing his own death . 
his family , though not épargnée by the malheurs , was very talentueuse and she has known a great success . 
the father was member of the Court Supreme of the Saskatchewan . Jim has continued in a society of lawyers to Regina who was the behalf of the raise . 
he is became man of Affairs and steering of business . 
he was generous in his activities volunteers , then he has " a life public . 
he has served 7 years to the House of the Commons and 20 years to the Senate . 
far of the replier on him - same and not the apitoyant never on the fate , he has concentré any the attention on the duty and on his interests until to the the believed . 
when his friends the Australian of his health , he was evidence of a great her and of a réalisme total . 
then he orientait the conversation to the questions who entirely the spirit to this time - that . 
during of a conversation that I I had recently with him , these questions were the of of the land military of the Canada , the allow of the Saskatchewan deals , the Museum of the War to Ottawa and , well heard , the prospects of the Party Conservative federal . 
he supportait all his problems of way décontractée and aside all his responsibilities with a seriously and a integrity copies . 
this was a man hon. , and the example of his life and of his death is a heritage which can be proud his family , his friends and his colleagues . 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I like me also address my sympathy to the family of the senator raise . 
when I am arrived to Regina in 1976 for with my position of Justice , I knew already the family raise . 
. not can the expressed in Regina without into on a point of interest which this family has given the behalf or left his in . 
I I known the senator raise indirectly to from of his appropriate accomplishments . 
in the profession , Jim raise was a man should . 
always well prepared . 
he their said not only how deal the case , but he their expliquait the importance of examine of the questions more broader , of the questions more deep and the aspects moral of any case which the courts were before . 
he had a respect for the bill who not the with not home many in the province . 
the senator raise was also known for his actions political in Saskatchewan . Integrity my share , after the have met , I me told how he had could do of the the - to - the , because he not had certainly not the president and the exubérance that . associate often to the members of the class policy . 
yet , when I I began to know Regina , a city who not was not the my , I I including that the commitment effacing to virtually all the questions importait to the people of his city and of his province . 
he people a way of do know the point of view on a question and he anyone a solution avantageuse for the community . 
I not think not that he there that a question which he not the be not he quiet . 
he not was never the Speaker or the position the more in view , but he was always in coulisse to give of the advice . 
he has fact evidence of the type of leadership who is the in of a man of state and not simply of a policy . 
with him , the two were seldom .

the more young to have tried of the Latimer in the the months was age of nine years .

question PERIOD PERIOD 
the Affairs Intergovernmental 
the bill of bill on the or of the process referendum - - guideline of application 
the hon. Pierre Claude Nolin : 
honourable senators , the clause 2 . ( 2 ) of the bill of bill on the or of the process referendum define the factors that the House of the Commons must consider for determine if a majority clear of Quebecers the are speeches for the Darrel of the Quebec . 
you you rappellerez that during of the last referendum , 49,6p. per of the Quebecers the are speeches in favour of the sovereignty of the Quebec parent of a offer of partnership to the rest of the Canada . 
50,4p. per of the Quebecers the are interestingly to this option . 
if . analysis of a little more close these percentages in service of the affiliation ethnic of the Quebecers , the data of Statistics Canada and the results by branch of vote , . in so to the conclusion shared by to little close all the experts that 62p. per of the francophones the are speeches in favour of the option sovereigntist and , to the opposed , realistic per of the English and 98p. per of the allophones the are speeches against the option of the Party Quebec . 
considering that the francophones constitute the majority of the people of the Quebec , that the vote of the English and of the allophones is concentré only in some areas déterminées of the Quebec , the Minister can - he we say if , in case of a victory of the side of the OUI of the indépendantistes - that I not research not of the all - the distribution ethnic and geographical of the vote will taken in consideration during of the review of the or of the majority of the constituents who the will speeches in favour of this option ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , he there has two consistently to all that , as the Court Supreme the has well underlined . 
the Prime , this is the or of the question , and the bill of bill is enough explicit to this about . 
the second , this is the majority clear , and this is this which about the hon. senator . 
the court , in his deliberations and in his decision , has well taken be of not not define in detail what factors would taken in consideration before the vote . 
the bill of bill about of some factors which he will to the . 
the bill of bill not préjuge not of the circumstances and not described not specifically to what level he will draw the limit , same if that has certainly should be trying to some times . 
, this regard , the bill of bill is all to fact consistent to the decision of the Court Supreme . 
the senator Nolin : 
honourable senators , this is the reason for which , in my preamble , I you I given the percentages . 
no expert not has challenged that the majority desQuébécois francophones , 62p. per , have voted OUI to the question of the Party Quebec during of the referendum of 1995 . 
, the opposed , realistic per of the English and 98p. per of the allophones have voted NON . 
your bill of bill not is - he not in are of give least of importance to the vote of the majority French that to the of the minority English and allophone ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , . not attempts not in the bill of bill of give more of importance to a part of the electorate in particular . 
some conditions will examined to the time of the assessment of the quality of the majority . 
some of these conditions are contained in the bill of bill , and of other not the are not . 
that the ask by the fact that . not can be what considerations enhanced in line of the . 
however , the bill of bill for clear a review public of all the factors . 
the essential , this is that all the Quebecers , what that be their origin ethnic , must power the express clear , by a majority clear , and that this majority be the result of a question clear who their has been raised . 
the senator Nolin : 
honourable senators , a majority clear not would - she not a majority of each of the bracket Parliamentarians of the people of the Quebec ? 
the senator Finestone : 
honourable senators , am - I a life of second class ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I am , by principle , to determine to the advance the percentages precise for manner this question . 
faithful to the notice of the Court Supreme , the bill of bill for that the . will to the of the circumstances existing to the time of a future referendum , this that will the Protagonists political to this time - that . 
hope that that not what never . 
however , that not is not the question . 
I the said , the bill of bill not the precludes not of the principle of the notice of the Court Supreme , who for that , to the time timely , the Protagonists political will this who represents a majority enough . 
the bill of bill states very specifically some of the factors which he will the the . 
the hon. Jean - Claude Rivest : 
honourable senators , in this who respect the question of the unity national , I those to the Minister that according the history recent of the Canada , the only way effective of fight the séparatisme to the Quebec is for the government of the Canada of have a vision on the reports between the Quebec and the together of the society Canadian . 
I am including reference to the time of Lester B . Pearson or of Brian Mulroney , where the rate of symbolic to the séparatisme had falling of 20 to 25 per . 
historically , to the Quebec , he there has had two ways for the parties sovereignists or separatists of try of obtain the symbolic of the Quebecers to the idea of the independence : the seaway referendum for obtain a majority of OUI to the question and the its of representatives to the Assembly national to the over of a election , as the of 1966 with the RIN , and in 1970 and in 1973 with the Party Quebec of René Lévesque . 
according this second option , the government sovereigntist elected would by to a statement of sovereignty . 
the present bill of bill of the government not with that of the seaway referendum . 
that arriverait - he to the unity of the Canada if a party sovereigntist to the Quebec it to the proposal of René Lévesque of the beginning of the years 70 , this is - to - say that the election of a government of the Party Quebec , who is a government clear sovereigntist , impliquerait , on a simple majority of members to the Assembly national , the implementation in Bill of the separation of the rest of the Canada ? 
the bill of bill not said nothing that - that . 
for you show the uniqueness saugrenu of the intervention of the government federal in this debate , in this first proposition , the Party Quebec said that with the election of a government sovereigntist and this mandate of the people , he Courts to the independence , as that the is fact in 1970 and in 1973 . 
they not have not win , but this was their program . 
according this proposition , the government federal adopterait - he a bill for determine the nature of the platform - form election of the Party Quebec for clarify the option on the sovereignty ? 
you understand why the Position of the government Canadian not is not accepted by the together of the stakeholders to the Quebec and why she is saugrenue . 
why the government Canadian not timely he not the opinion , as this is the right of the do ? 
he is all to fact legitimate that he the the because that he is the wharfinger Prime of the unity national . 
that he it to the Assembly national and , particularly to the Party Liberal of the Quebec , the the - speak federalist on the territory Quebec , the be of do the battle on the or of the question and on the définiton of the majority . 
that would of a way many more make the option federalist and the option of the unity Canadian . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the question of the hon. senator is enough complex , as by his length that by his nature . 
the Prime Minister of the Quebec has said that he has the intention of to a other referendum when the conditions winners will up . 
he is obvious that , in as that citizens responsible and that government federal responsible , we must answer to this statement . 
this that the government move is simple and obvious . 
he we responsibility of take the Prime Minister of the Quebec to the word . 
the he the a other referendum , we must we ensure that he there a question clear and that he understands well that he must obtain a majority clear before of power act . 
I not see not how anyone to the Quebec or , to the Canada could the against to that . 
the Prime Minister of the Quebec not has he not the intention of question a question clear ? 
has he the intention of act other ? 
what is the objection to the fair ? 
if I me recall well , the Prime Minister of the Quebec has praising this decision . 
a of the elements basic of this decision is that the people of the Canada and the government of the Canada have a role to play . 
personally , I détesterais see the government the exempt to the role . 
the senator Rivest : 
honourable senators , the Minister me the that the government Canadian has decided of act to this time - this because that the Prime Minister of the Quebec has said would to a referendum . 
why the very hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau , after have heard René Lévesque say , to the next of the election in 1976 , that he would to a referendum on the sovereignty , not has he not decided of present , him who was wharfinger of the unity national , a bill of bill for determine the benchmarks of the question and of the majority ? 
the very hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau not was - he not also intending of the unity Canadian and of the protection of the interests of the together of the Canadians that the present Prime Minister of the Canada ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the Prime Minister Trudeau the concern enormous of the unity Canadian . 
however , we is in a situation where , apparently with the approval of the Prime Minister of the Quebec and certainly of the counterpart of the Canada , the Court Supreme has éclairci this question as never that not the is fact in our history . 
we not had not such decision the last time ; we the we now . 
if I me recall well , this is a decision who has received the those of the Prime Minister of the Quebec . 
in his decision , the Court Supreme has established some criteria very age . 
she give and to the government federal a opportunity reasonable of contextualize these questions in a perspective clear , then that we not we ourselves not in full battle referendum . 
in biggest , the government underscored on two points simple , but basic . 
if a province whatever , and not only the Quebec , to the from of the Canada , he him must question a question clear to his people and obtain a response clear . 
that is true , that he the whether of the Alberta , of the British - British or of the Nova - Nova and , certainly , nothing not cannot be more reasonable . 
however , the government federal not is not the of act if these conditions not are not respected . 
the senator Rivest : 
honourable senators , I I a question Supplementary to question . 
the Minister could - he we quote the a of the judgment of the Court Supreme of the Canada who ask to the Parliament Canadian of legislation ? 
is - this that the judgment of the Court Supreme of the Canada , who said this that the Minister just of say , and I in agree welcome , has force of bill to the Canada ? 
and why not not let Jean Charest and the Party Liberal of the Quebec thoughts this battle and remind to the government of the Quebec in place that : 
the bill of the country is stated in the decision of the Court Supreme of the Canada . 
we not we not need of the bill of bill Mr. Dion . 
the senator Boudreau : 
this is that a argument different , honourable senators . 
if a human said that we not in we not need or that the time chosen for the present not is not , she it then clear hear that he not there has not of disagreement . 
the Court Supreme has indicated very clear that he there has of the factors which he must to the . 
I me would a happy of back a copy of the decision of the Court Supreme to the hon. senator . 
the senator Ghitter : 
répondez to the question ! 
the senator Boudreau : 
this bill of bill shows that the two parties have of the responsibilities . 
the government of the Canada has clear tenure his responsibility with the bill of bill . 
the government federal has fact know his Position to the people of the country of a way very reasonable and has indicated the factors which he the would for determine if the conditions for in the decision of the Court Supreme are respected . 
these factors would very useful for all citizen of not any what province Canadian who would to take a decision clear , if . him ask of the take in the future . 
the Court Supreme 
the terminologie regarding the decision on the referred relatif to the referendum 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , to the over of the brief series of questions who has been raised until to now to this about , I I indeed that the Leader of the government to the Senate has used ten time the word " decision " in issue of the notice given by the Court Supreme of the Canada . 
, my notice , if we must deal of a question of a importance also crucial , we must be very cautiously and very precise in the way which we employons the words . 
the Minister not is - he not that the referred presented by the government of the Canada to the Court Supreme sollicitait not not a decision , but rather a notice ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , as the said the hon. senator , he the was of a referred and the Court Supreme of the Canada has given a notice , I in agree . 
this is a notice who has been well was to the time by the Prime Minister of the Quebec . 
the transport 
the Nova - Nova - - commitment of the government federal of expand to four Ways the road EH 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I like know when we will obtain these helicopters . 
I like also know where the Minister of the Transport and the chairman of Onex are today today .

however , to my knowledge , no ask of this kind not has been passed until to now . 
I am this deal under any contingency , because I not I not spoke to the Minister of that since a week and half .

according the sections in question , of the senior officials of Health Canada have said that they not have not of figures on the amount of caffeine that the Canadians ingèrent already in consommant of the drinks Caffeine , of the chocolat , of the tea and of the thé - of all sources . 
they say not have more that two opportunities . 
they can the proud to the data that their served the industry or develop the worse scenario . 
I think that he there in has a third . 
they can ask to Statistics Canada of their provide of the data of basic . 
the hon. Minister could - he ask to the Minister of the Health of from the testimony of a source impartiale for determine if the health of the Canadians will compromised or not ?

as . the knows , a canette of Penitentiary Dew contains more of caffeine that several tasses of tea . 
after have played to the hockey , the young , there including my grandchildren - children , not grab nothing of difficulty to take a boisson for sports such that Penitentiary Dew . 
we will now their serve of good sharply of caffeine . 
the caffeine is a psychotrope and should be étiquetée in as that drug . 
of any way , the report of the committee of scientific who does to the Minister was , except mistake , be debated in July last . 
the hon. Minister could - he whether why , if this report was be debated in July , he not has not still been the public ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :

for this who is of the further of his question , he must always establish a balance between the degree of regulatory of the activity human by the government and the freedom of choice . 
I acknowledge the legitimacy of the concern of the hon. senator , but I not think not that we are on the point of legislation to of deals to the amends the access to the Tim Horton . 
the senator Spivak :

order orders OF 
the Act of implementation in implement of the Agreement on the Station spatiale international civil 
third Reading - Suspended of the debate 
the the the Speaker : 
pleasure - he to the senators of adopt the motion ? 
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , to first view , the bill of bill C - 4 is a bill of bill inoffensif , délicieux same , who deserves the support from of the two parties represented to the Senate . 
this is a legislation who is to to in implement the agreements international that the Canada has conclude on the cooperation Current to the Argonauts spatiale . 
all the world not can therefore that support the principle basic of the bill of bill . 
the - this has been adopted prestement to the other place after several p.m. of debate and a review by the committee of the House of the Commons . 
I support me also the principle of the bill of bill . 
however , God or the devil knows this that we reserving the details . 
I I looked a the of i on the bill of bill a first time when he has been submitted to a review quick of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign . 
before the hearings of the committee , I I asked to the senior officials of the government why he was necessary of have the approval of the Parliament then that the improvements international could be implemented in implement on the only approval of the cabinet . 
why ? 
because that the agreed for that the States members suitable that their legislation criminal the étende to the Argonauts spatiale and to the prohibit to Seeking and in from of the Argonauts spatiale . 
honourable senators , I me réfère therefore to the clause 11 of the bill of bill who amend the Code criminal and to the clause 22 of the Agreement for excellent the ramifications of this application extraterritorial of our bill . 
I I discovered that the States members incluaient the Union European , the States - United , the Canada , the Japan and the Russia , and that the laws pénales of each of these States the apply . 
the honourable senators the recall of the amendments that I had proposed to the bill of bill C - 40 , the Act on the extradition , seconded by my colleague the senator Joyal , to of ôter to the Minister of the Justice the power counterweight in the case of the requests of extradition from of States where the accused could be court to the only of death . 
the only capital has been - to the Canada he there has close of three decades . 
after a debate in good and properly form , these amendments had been focus to the Senate . 
the honourable senators the recall that the senators of this side - this of the House had followed the consignes of the whip of the Party . 
the bill of bill C - 4 ressuscite the same questions who had fact the subject of the amendments focus in the case of the bill Bill C - 40 . 
the Minister of the Justice Custody the power counterweight of decide or not of obtain of the guarantees of a state not to not abolish the only capital who ask the extradition , by example , of a Canadian sue for murder . 
I I fact out the Position ingrate in which is the the Minister of the Justice who must decide of a question of life or of death then that the bill Canadian is clear - more no condemnation to the only capital . 
this power beware the applies now to the space atmosphérique with the bill of bill C - 4 . 
do a presumption . 
does that a Canadian is accused of have made a murder in the Argonauts spatiale . 
a declaration is also accused of have made a murder in the Argonauts spatiale . 
the Canada and all the country members of the Union European have abolish the only capital . 
the Argonauts spatiale has been lancée to from of the Texas , a state where the only capital not has not been - . 
the declaration not could not be extradé to the Texas , to least that this state not give to the country member of the Union European in question the guarantee that the only capital not will not implemented . 
in advances , our Minister of the Justice would the power counterweight of decide or not of extrader the Canadian with or without guarantee that the only of death not will not implemented . 
honourable senators , the Court Supreme has been back of this question by the through of the because Rafay and Burns which we we spoke during our debate on the bill of bill C - 40 . 
in this case , the Minister of the Justice was prepared to extrader to the Texas two young Canadians of 18 years charged of crimes punissables of death without have the insurance that the only of death not would not implemented in their case . 
that was contrary to the clause 7 of the Charter of the rights I believe and some judges of the Court of call of the British - British were also of this notice . 
the because fact now the subject of a call before the Court Supreme of the Canada who the has heard the 5 October 99 . 
the week last , to the committee of the Affairs foreign , of the officials we have said that , by a order enough unusual , the Court Supreme has asked of hear to new the plaidoiries . 
by therefore , the question raised in the amendment that the Senate had wanted to retained to the bill of bill C - 40 , and who has been rejected to the Senate , is still to the study to the Court Supreme of the Canada , though in the context of the facts ties of this because in particular . 
is why I me am one of participate to the study clause by clause to the committee and is also why I I the intention of not not participate to the study to the step of the report and to the third Reading . 
why the alone to the place of present a other amendment ? 
the officials we have said that the government has the intention of present the amendments appropriate if the Court Supreme wants of limit the discretion of the Minister . 
the Court Supreme should we enlighten very soon . 
if the government is still pressé of act to this time that , I me undertake formally to its this legislation legislative if strange and if incohérente when the Court Supreme of the Canada the will order . 
I me abstiens and I forward the decision of the Court Supreme ; I hope that the government Glenney with haste for withdraw to the Minister of the Justice this discretion all to fact anachronique and unfair . 
the hon. Serge Joyal : 
honourable senators , the bill of bill C - 4 , Act of implementation in implement of the Agreement on the Station spatiale international civil , me concern to the more senior point . 
I am grateful to the senator Grafstein of have brought this question to my attention then that I participais to the study of the bill Bill S - 10 to the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs legal and Constitutional . 
the provisions for to the clause 11 of the bill Bill C - 4 create of the respond on the power of the Minister of the Justice of Authorize the extradition of Criminal Canadian to of the States where the only of death is a of be put . 
the clause 11 of this bill of bill amend the clause 7 of the Code criminal by the adding of new provisions to for effect of expand the application of the Code criminal to the Argonauts spatiale international . 
the new ) ( 2.31 ) 
Edward Code criminal specific this who following : 
he in result that the jurisdiction criminal of the Canada the over now to the new Argonauts spatiale international . 
in addition , she the ( in cooperation with 14 other country in the framework of the agreed international for the Argonauts spatiale . 
by therefore , the 14 other States countries concur of the provisions similar in their right pénal . 
the clause 11 of the bill of bill C - 4 raises specifically the same question of further that the ) 42 ( 2 ) of the bill of bill C - 40 presented during of the last session , to know the power counterweight of the Minister of the Justice of Appear the extradition that where the only of death is being . 
that still , the people extradées of the Canada not benefit of no protection against the only of death . 
as you you in recall , I I statement the principles basic under - revealed to my Position on the question essential of the only of death to the spring last , when the Senate has examined the bill of bill C - 40 , the bill on the extradition . 
during the debate on the third Reading of this bill of bill , I I seconded a amendment proposed by the senator Grafstein who would required that the Minister of the Justice will a promise of the state requérant as to the fact that the only of death not would not infligée or that , if she the was , she not would not implementation to enforcement . 
the only of death would rather changée in only of other to life locks without possible of bombing Earl . 
he is , according me , completely incorrect and contrary to the clause of the clause 7 of the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms of let the life or the death of a Canadian to the discretion of a Minister of the Crown . 
these questions important are now the about of the case Rafay and Burns , who has been heard this year to the Court Supreme of the Canada . 
this case , as you you in recall , has relates to the decision of the hon. Allan Rock , P , Motion the extradition of two citizens Canadian of 18 years to a state of the States - United where they are inculpés of murder and where they encourent the only of death . 
in formulant his decision , Mr. Rock not has not sought to the ensure that the part poursuivante in this state not requérrait not the only of death . 
the decision of laCour Supreme not has not still been made , but the labourers judges have ordered that the case be of new entenduele 25 October 99 . 
in the testimony that he has fact the Tuesday 7 December 99 before the committee of the Affairs foreign , Mr. Yvan Roy , lawyer General of the 110 of the policy in the of right pénal to the Department of the Justice , has explained that the power of a Minister of the Justice of Authorize the extradition continue of be a power counterweight full and without an and that he not is not atténué by the bill of bill C - 4 . 
is this that has adjust Roy : 
... the Minister of the Justice , who is responsible of the application of the Act on the extradition , can refuse of take a ascertain of been when the conduct to the regard of which . has presented the ask of extradition fact the subject of the criminal to the Canada intentées against this human . 
Mr. . Roy has also recognized that the judgment the in the case Burns and Rafay maze can - be the Minister to from of the assurance before of Authorize the extradition in of such case . 
is this that he has said : 
Mr. the chairman , you know that the Court Supreme of the Canada is currently back of the question in the framework of the case Burns and Rafay . 
he the can very well that . will point a other clause of this legislation legislative , the the of this that the Court Supreme of the Canada will to say if the only of death could be put in the country abroad . 
of after the bill current , a such obligation not there not , but that become can - be the bill , of after this that each this judgment . 
honourable senators , the given these circumstances , and the the of the principles that I I already , the spring last , presentations in detail in the the the of the Senate on the question of the only of death , I not then , in any good conscience , vote in favour of the clause 11 of the bill of bill C - 4 , who give effect to the agreed regarding the juridiction criminal shared on the Station spatiale international civil . 
by therefore , I wish to do know formally that I I the intention of me alone of vote when the motion of third Reading of the bill of bill C - 4 will implementation to the Senators . 
the hon. Lucie pin : 
honourable senators , I give notice that I me refrain of vote on the bill of bill C - 4 , for the same reasons that those who have been data by the honourable senators Grafstein and Joyal . 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I not me bothersome not in this discussion raised by the senators Grafstein and Joyal . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I like ask your indulgence . 
I note that he is 15 p.m. 29 , and we we agreed of to to this time - this to the notice of inquiry of the senator Gauthier to that he can take the speak during 15 minutes . 
I ask therefore the leave of to to the notice of inquiry who is recorded to the behalf of the senator Gauthier and who respect a report on the recent Summit of the Francophonie . 
the the the Speaker : 
is - this of agreed , honourable senators for allow of to the inquiry No. 1 ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
I remind to the honourable senators that the committee of the Affairs foreign has received the leave of sit now . 
the the the Speaker : 
I am sorry , senator Andreychuk , but the leave has been granted . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
I want have of the instructions . 
the the the Speaker : 
her the senator point she the Rules ? 
the Senate has authorized the committee of the Affairs foreign to the meet to 15 p.m. 30 today today . 
that any , I am prepared to CPAs the speak to the senator Gauthier . 
the Senate wish he that I take the speak to the about of this clause of the order of the day now or that I the take more later for power attend to the sitting of the committee , which I am a member to the right of vote ? 
I must solve this énigme all the duration and Wednesdays . 
the senator Hays : 
honourable senators , I not am not course that the Senate can help the senator Andreychuk . 
this is the choice . 
she is of any obviously free of attend to the sitting of the committee since the Senate has authorized the committee to sit in same time that him . 
I will do in so that her the senator Andreychuk be avisée when we reprendrons the debate on the bill of bill C - 4 , be in 15 minutes about , to that she can to for participate to the debate if such is the wish . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
I will ask to a of my colleagues of ask the adjournment of the debate in my behalf if I not am not here . 
the senator Hays : 
as we hope debate the bill of bill C - 4 today today , I ask to the senator Andreychuk of take the speak today today . 
the hon. Jean - Robert Gauthier : 
honourable senators , I am all to fact prepared to take the speak after the senator Andreychuk , if she is the last human to take the speak on this clause of the order of the day . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
I will ask the adjournment in my behalf and take the speak tomorrow . 
the senator Hays : 
I like that we the done today today . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I not had not the intention of to a long speech on this question . 
we we ample discussed of the only capital to the time of the study of the Act on the extradition . 
I I fact clear know my opinion to this time - that , and I not I not changed of notice . 
I I agreed that he was none of participate to the process of implementation in implement of the agreed on the Argonauts spatiale . 
in consequential , I believe that he not is not in the interest public and that this not is not a good practice Parliamentary that of expect the decision of the Court Supreme . 
if the Court Supreme require of other measures legislation , . the in looking in time and place . 
for the time , the bill is clear . 
I the said , the question has been debated to the time of the study of the Act on the extradition . 
I not I not changed of idea to this regard . 
I want thank the Department of the Justice and the committee for their excellent work relatively to the clause 11 of the bill Bill C - 4 . 
he there had a problem with the version English and I believe understand that the version French the reads perfectly well . 
we pass a bill criminal Canadian and the appliquons to the Argonauts spatiale .

the Summit of the Francophonie 
inquiry - Adjourned of the debate 
leave to been granted of to to the inquiry number 1 : 
the hon. Jean - Robert Gauthier , to given notice the Wednesday 13 October 99 : 
that he call the attention of the Senate on the recent Summit of the Francophonie who the is the to Moncton to the months of September last . 
the Summit of the Francophonie who has had place to Moncton , to the New - Brunswick , to the beginning of the months of September omissions a order of the day for the least responsible . 
unfortunately , the failures of the rampe the are quickly affecting of the business that were to the different leaders of States gathered for the braquer on the legality or the legitimacy of the presence of some people to the Summit . 
as you the know , I I had the honour of chairman during of the two last years , the Assembly of the parliamentarians of the Francophonie . 
I traiterai therefore someone little in my , intervention of the role of the APF with of the summit , for then to the épineuse question of the legitimacy and of the ability of representation of a Leader of state who would soupçonné of have legalistic some rights that we by to the Canada as basic and élémentaires in any society free and democratic . 
the Assembly Parliamentary of the Francophonie , as you the know , is a link asset between the representations of the Francophonie and the effect francophones , since the legislative has of 47 sections to the within of the parliaments , States and communities francophones and 12 sections 2.4 . 
addition a important work of reflection and of cooperation Parliamentary , she at to the implementation in place and to the strengthening of the institutions democratic and to the missions of observation of election . 
during of the Summit of Maurice , to the months of October 1993 , after have réaffirmé the place imminente of the institution Parliamentary to the heart of the democracy fundamental and of the state of right of the summit , . has considered that the APF , only organization Parliamentary of the Francophonie , is the link democratic between the governments and the Peoples of the Francophonie . 
in consequential , . has decided of recognize the APF as the Assembly consultative of the Francophonie , this that has confirmed the Charter of the Francophonie , agreed to Hanoi in November 1997 , who Heritage , by , , the position of Secretary General of the Francophonie , he Mr. Boutros Boutros - Boutros , former - Secretary General of the UN . 
for the to in Conformity with the Charter , the legislative has decided , during of his session plain of Abidjan , in July 1998 , of adopt the behalf of Assembly Parliamentary of the Francophonie . 
, as of Assembly consultative of the Summit , the Assembly Parliamentary of the Francophonie has participated to the Summit of Moncton to the over which the new chairman , Mr. Nicolas Amougou Noma , Prime chairman - chairman of the Assembly general of the Cameroon , has fact a intervention before the leaders of state and of government . 
, the over of the intervention , Mr. from Amougou Noma has including réaffirmé the commitment of the APF to the democracy Parliamentary , to the state of right and that the Opposition to any transmission of the power by the force of the weapons . 
he has reminded the taken of Position of the APF against the children soldiers and in favour of the implementation in place quick of the future court criminal international . 
the Assembly of the parliamentarians of the Francophonie support the decision taken during of the summit of create a observatoire of the democracy , that she has always called of all his best and which she does participate in Dolly the expertise of the parliamentarians . 
the APF the pleased also of the reaction favourable should to the bill of creation of a Parliament of the young francophones , to the implementation in place which she wish be closely associated . 
she has noted with many of interest the statements of the Summit regarding the diversity linguistic in favour of which she the is involved drew . 
in advances , she not can that the question on the Proceed continuous since several years of the number of members of the Francophonie , which this not is not the service of become a second Organization of the Nations Nations not more that a second Commonwealth . 
, the future , of new adhésions must be conditionnées by of the commitments regarding the use of the French in the framework of the relations international and of the education . 
finally , the APF remind that she not the in his enough that the legislatures parliamentarians élues in the required respect of the standards Constitutional of their country and that she has suspended those of his members who had up of respect this principle . 
she not in has therefore that more of with for exposing the campaign who would any the Francophonie of complaisance particular to the regard of the plans dictatoriaux . 
she timely his conviction of the need of a action permanent in favour of the democracy to the daily , of the type of the that she slow now , of the missions of observation of election , the training of the elected , the forums , the meetings order for discuss how better act as Parliamentary in a country democratic . 
, this about , the media have fact great of of the presence of a representative of the Rwanda and of the Congo . 
and , to my sense , they have brought proceeds to the business of the summit and entaché this year if crucial to the vitality of the Francophonie international . 
I I taken the freedom of write to the Prime Minister Jean tien to this sujetle 24 August last . 
in his response of the 31 August , the Prime Minister me fact share of the will of the Canada , and I quote : 
... ... ... of respect the obligation to the place of the Francophonie , be allow to the representatives of all the country members of the meet to the Canada for ceVIIe Summit . 
however , that not means no that we cautionnons the abuses took by some governments or individuals who could there participate . 
I understand the Position of the Prime Minister , but I believe that he is great time of redéfinir the éligibilité of some leaders to participate to of the meetings of dispute international . 
of , , to this about , the Minister of the Affairs foreign of the Canada , the hon. Lloyd Axworthy , illegality that the Canada was or would in favour of a right of meddling humanitarian . 
. implementation therefore the principle of the above of the security human on any other activity , including same the development of the trade . 
I me rallie to a such Position . 
she base , to my sense , the opinion that I exprimais to the Prime Minister , to know that the rights of the man must have above on good number of customs and of practices in the of relations international . 
I believe personally that he will soon possible of impose as condition sine qua not to a representation international legitimate the respect of the rights human for the country désirant participate to a conference international . 
he the would of a beware tool for show the seaway to some country récalcitrants , to the same as that the embargos commercial and the a of the links diplomatic . 
I hope , honourable senators , that . will the to this recommendation by that the States who want participate to the organizations international must now respect the rights human in all time . 
( on the motion of the senator Kinsella , the debate is adjourned . )

the senator Stollery : 
honourable senators , the Canadians are among the more great users of Technology spatiale and they live in a of the country the more cool to the world . 
that the ask by a will an of expand the opportunities of our industry , of our researchers , of our astronautes and , by - that all , of the generations future of Canadians . 
the bill of bill C - 4 is essentially to allow to the Canada of before all the opportunities that offer the Station spatiale international . 
the bill of bill is the instrument of ratification of our contribution to this remarkable business spatiale , but he not is that a small not for the Canada in a bill who represents a not of géant for the humanity . 
he not is that normal that a bill of a such scope and of a such processes require that the . définisse a system of management very complex . 
the parties to the agreement , to know the Canada , the States - United , the Russia , the Japan and 11 country European , have undertaken of establish a framework of cooperation international in view of the conception detailed , of the development , of the and and of the use , to of the for harshness , of a Station spatiale international civil habitée in state . 
the agreed for of the mechanisms and of the arrangements to to the ensure that these objectives are refreshed . 
juridiquement issue , the bill of bill C - 4 the to enforcement the commitments that we we taken in under of the protocol of agreement intergouvernemental in harmonisant the legislation Canadian with this agreed . 
fact more important , the bill of bill C - 4 over the application of the Code criminal of the Canada to the Canadians to on of the Argonauts spatiale and that , in some circumstances , to the Criminal foreign . 
the principle is the same that in the other applications extraterritoriales of the Code criminal of the Canada , by example on the plateformes of forage in sea . 
in addition , the bill of bill C - 4 allows of we ensure that the government Canadian has of the information essential for him allow of Canada his obligations to the as of the Agreement on the Argonauts spatiale and that the information provided are used exclusively to this end . 
I like thank my colleagues , in particular , the members of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign for the great interest that they have concern to the regard of this bill of bill and of the SSI . 
in as that chairman of the committee , I I been encouraged of see the attention that were the members to this important step of the history of the Canada in the space . 
during the hearings of the committee , some points have been raised and debated , including of the questions provisions to the codifies of conduct , to the juridiction and to the application extraterritorial . 
I am happy of say that through to the expeditiously and to the effectiveness of the senators , we we are still rapprochés of the Adopted of this bill of bill historic . 
his ratification opens the seaway to the Canada and , who , to all the partners participant to the program of the Argonauts spatiale , in this who respect the and and the use of the more great laboratory spatial of the world he in state , and will birth to a new era of exploration spatiale . 
, the enter of the new century , the Canada is a Leader world in the area of the Technology spatiale , prepared to from party of the opportunities that will the economy represents on the know who is the of the future . 
the Canadians éprouveront a great pride to having , " in direct of the space " , the astronautes Canadian participant to this event grand of the history of the humanity . 
he not fact no doubt that , in this beginning of new millennium , we we préparons also to repudiate the boundaries of our who , to wasn of important découvertes scientific , and to do of the progress technological innovative . 
we not can same not imagine the découvertes the more important may of be made in the 25 to 50 next years . 
imaginons how , he there has per years , were Softwood the progress scientific made since . 
the théories révolutionnaires on the the , the evolution and the thermodynamique of the years canoe have should may of a progress ahurissant . 
yet , this not are not the sceptical who are , which the imagination not so not to follow the evolution quick of the science and of the Technology . 
that he me be for of remind to this about few anecdotes historic amusantes . 
Charles H . Duell , steering of the Board of the patents to the States - United , had said in Horse that " all this who was to invent the had already been " . 
in 1943 , Thomas Watson , chairman of IBM , would said " he there a market world for five computers all to the more " . 
he not is not surprising that , in a number of 1949 of the magazine Popular Mechanics , . that predicting that " the computers of the future could not weigh that a would and half " . 
by , , a note of service Economy of the Western Union , business American of telecommunications , stated that " the Technology of the telephone it too to wanting for be seriously any as way of communication " . 
Bell would - he could the imagine the way which the lines phone have into our society and which they are now used for do of the detour with he vidéos to of the destinataires many ? 
according of the estimates , between 270 and 350 satellites of telecommunications will lancées of here 2007 in view of support the infrastructure World of the information in full growth which the revenues doubleront of here the year 2005 . 
the " apparatus power of transmission of the Senators " of Bell has open the seaway to the Highway of the information that we know today today . 
who would could the imagine that the industry Ministerial in direct , also called trade Ministerial , who not there not to the end of 1993 disorderly before the end of 1995 a growth who him would of fundamental the same importance that the steel and the no to their time . 
the community medical , through to the business wishes in the areas of the space , of the Science and of the Technology , the employ to eliminate completely some diseases and to find of the solutions to some other . 
our community scientific , to the within of which the scientific Canadian of the space are the leaders of leadership , contributes to our understanding of the who and of the effects of the réchauffement overall of the would . 
our community industrial , through to the industry spatiale Canadian , happened of the revenues annual higher to 1.4 billion of $ , and creates of the jobs , of the foreign and of the expertise for a market world without has growing . 
the courage of take of the risk and the perseverance on the seaway of the success under - tend each child and each Innovation . 
in despite of the failure , each jalon must be perceived as by part of the need acquiescence of the humanity of urge and of understand the unknown . 
, the over of the 50 next years , he not there no way of know what small - retournée , same the he the is of a - on the greater of the world Mars , lavish to a new who of the Science . 
who Graham Bell has already said this who following : 
when a the the firm , a other the which ; however , he we so if often of draw during long and to regret the the closed that we not let not the other doors who the leaves before we . 
the Station spatiale international civil not is that a of the doors who the leaves to the Canada . 
she fact of the Canada a of the major partners in the walking spatiale the more audacieuse never business in the history , all in allowing that the . the call to of the scientific , of the astronautes , to the experience and to the Technology of the Canada . 
the Investment to long term the more remarkable in these partnerships is the creation of opportunities who wisely our young to recognize that they can them also play a role in the découvertes of the new millennium and to would there participate . 
this is therefore with many of pride that I urge the honourable senators to support this jalon for the together of the Canadians and of the humanity in the areas of the exploration spatiale and of the Innovation technologique . 
the the the Speaker : 
pleasure - he to the honourable senators of adopt the motion ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
( the motion is agreed and the bill of bill , read a third time , is adopted . ) 
bill of bill of 99 for the implementation in Bill of conventions tax 
third Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
- honourable senators , I am pleased of take the speak today today to the step of the third Reading of the bill of bill S - 3 , Act of 99 for the implementation in Bill of conventions tax . 
the bill of bill amend the convention tax between the Canada and the Japan , the the implementation in implement of new conventions with the Kirghizistan , the Lebanon , the Algeria , the Bulgaria , the Portugal , the Ouzbékistan and the Jordan , and is the convention in into with the Luxembourg . 
the conventions simple by the bill of bill are a importance particular for the businesses and the citizens of the Canada who together of the activities in these country and there invest . 
let - me of you airing the context in which the recorded the bill of bill . 
the conventions tax have two great objectives : avoid the double tax and prevent the evasion in the of tax on the income . 
you flavour therefore that the conventions tax have a impact sensitive on two of the priorities of the state , be , of a share , the promotion of the trade and of the investment , be , of other share , the equity tax . 
the conventions tax the reformed directly to the trade international of property and of services , and they thus of way tangible on the economy domestic . 
must - he remind that the value of the exports of the Canada represents to the time current more of 40 per of the GDP annual ? 
in addition , the conventions tax help to the equity of the regime tax in thereby that the Canadians not are not victims of a double tax , situation who can up when a taxpayer ahead in a country , but earner a income in a other country . 
, is of conventions tax , the a and the other country could impose this income . 
among the solutions possible to this problem , the country of residence can removing this income of tax or give a credit in under of a convention tax to the as of the tax paid to the country where the income has been win . 
the country responsible can also there of reduce the rate of restraint to the for of tax . 
in effect , the country indiscriminately in General of the tables to the as of the tax on the income paid to the not - residents . 
in the absence of convention tax or of a other form of exemption the by the bill , the rate of restraint took by the Canada on the income of the not - residents is of 25 per . 
the conventions tax simple by the bill of bill S - 3 indiscriminately of the rate of restraint down including to the regard of the dividends , interests and royalties for the Canadians Work of the activities in the country in question . 
let - me you give few Particulars . 
the rate safeguarded of restraint of tax on the dividends received by of the businesses holding to the least 10 per of the rights of vote of the society versant the dividends will of 5 per to the words of the conventions with the Luxembourg , the Lebanon and the Ouzbékistan , and of 10 per to the words of the convention with the Bulgaria and the Jordan . 
in under of our convention with the Portugal , a business must have to the least 25 per of the rights of vote of a society for be set to the rate of restraint safeguarded of 10 per on the dividends . 
the conventions with the Algeria and the Kirghizistan indiscriminately a rate of had safeguarded of 15 per on all the dividends . 
in the case of the interests , the rate of restraint minimum is de10p. per pursuant to the conventions with the Bulgaria , the Luxembourg , the Jordan , the Ouzbékistan , the Lebanon and the Portugal , and of 15 per in application of the conventions with the Algeria and the Kirghizistan . 
a exemption is the in some case to the regard of the interests , by example those that reformed some types of borrowing of the state . 
a restraint maximale of 10 per to the as of the tax will implemented on the royalties to the words of our conventions with the Bulgaria , the Luxembourg , the Jordan , the Ouzbékistan , the Kirghizistan and the Portugal . 
the rate accomplishing provided by the convention with the Algeria , always to the regard of the royalties , will of 15 per . 
Également , some conventions conventions a clause of exemption or apply a rate safeguarded of restraint de5p. per on the royalties applicable to the rights of author , to the software and to the patents and know - do . 
the protocol concluded with the Japan the the reduction of the tables applicable to the dividends interentreprises , which the rate safeguarded is brought to 5 per and exonère the companies Canadian who have of the ships or of the aircraft in the area of the transportation international of the taxes of the businesses modern to the the local to the Japan . 
the provinces Canadian overwhelmingly already this exemption of courtesy to the businesses Japanese who exercise of such activities to the Canada . 
given given that the most of the conventions signed by the Canada , there including those with the Ouzbékistan , the Bulgaria , the Algeria and the Kirghizistan , have been négociées before the announcement of these rules , a clause has been incorporée to the rules ensured on the migration of the taxpayers to that the Canada can give unilaterally a credit for tax abroad to the émigrants and this , until in 2007 . 
this approach avoids all risk of double tax of the gains made before the departure of the émigrants , of here to this that the conventions in question have been renégociées of manner to be ensure to the new rules . 
the same clause the applies in the case of the Japan , who has asked that this question be matter during of the next negotiations . 
I like finally answer to the concerns expressed by few honourable senators as to the convention of double tax with the Ouzbékistan to because of the practices of this country in the of rights of the human . 
these values find their incarnation in our institutions and practices democratic , in the commissions federal and provincial of the rights of the human , in the Charter of the rights and freedoms , and in our traditions of peace , of order and of good government . 
the approach of the Canada in the of rights of the human since 1986 , without regard to the changes of government , is the commitment and the dialogue . 
the Canada is of notice that the to of a dialogue to several levels with the country who we causent of the concerns in the of rights of the human is a way effective of promote the transparency , the respect of the rights of the human and the symbolic to the rule of right . 
our policy the based before all of the pragmatism , a pragmatism encadré by of the principles , to the way which we we efforçons of define the measures concrete who fairer on a change positive and real in the country in because . 
the measures that we take vary inevitably according the country , according the degree of will of discuss with the Canada of questions with the rights of the human , the scope of our influence on this country or on his region , the number and the force of the NGOs who there oeuvrent in favour of the rights of the human , and in service of all a wide of other factors . 
in the case of the Ouzbékistan , that this be to the level bilateral or multilateral , the Canada undertake this country to about of the reforms economic and democratic and to better respect the rights of the human . 
, the level multilateral , the Ouzbékistan has accédé in 1994 and 1995 to six treated important of the Nations Nations on the rights of the human , this who allows to the Canada and to the other States members of the Nations Nations of whether if the Ouzbékistan satisfy to his obligations to the words of these treated . 
this country has , in addition , signed the Act final of Helsinki , of so that he is now member of the Organization for the security and the cooperation in Europe . 
the Canada support the programs of monitoring and of democratization of the OSCE in this country . 
this is to this as that the CIDA has sponsored the participation of representatives of organizations ouzbékes of Defence of the rights of the human to a great conference of the OSCE on this question , held to Warsaw in 1998 . 
by , , the Agency Canadian of development international would the support to a sure number of bills ouzbékes in the area of the rights of the human , including the preparation and the distribution of a brochure on the Declaration Universal of the rights of the man by the Centre national of the rights of the human of Ouzbékistan . 
by the of the démentèlement of the Union Soviet , he has should negotiate of new agreements with the States , such the Ouzbékistan , who not are not part of the States successors from by the convention of double tax reached with the former - Union Soviet . 
the Canada has undertaken of the negotiations in 1995 , in reason of the interest that showing the businesses Canadian for this market , including for the sector of the resources natural . 
the Ouzbékistan is a of the more great country producers of however to the world . 
, this day , well that the trade of the Canada with the Ouzbékistan the avèrent modest , the businesses Canadian continue of the interest to of the sectors such that the and mining , the telecommunications and , all recently , the education , in particular the creation of schools of studies trade in Ouzbékistan and the reform of the system of education . 
the negotiating of a convention of double tax with the Ouzbékistan is consistent to the will of the Canada of facilitate the a of a economy governed to a economy of market and of promote the development democratic in the new States independent of the former - Union Soviet . 
of the instruments legal as the convention help to promote the transparency , the predictability and the respect of the law of the right in our relations economic bilateral . 
honourable senators , the Canada continue of the Engage in a dialogue with the Ouzbékistan of way to encourage this country to improve his practices in the of development democratic , of respect of the rights of the human and of reform economic . 
however , he is difficult of the implanter on the markets of the former - Union Soviet and that require a preparation of long manfully . 
the instruments legal who help to the do , such the convention of double tax , consistent in of the agreements - does who guarding the intérets of the Canadians and of the businesses Canadian . 
when these last being of expand their activities to of the markets difficult as the of the Ouzbékistan , these instruments have for advantage of clarification the rules and of improve the predictability . 
before of complete , I speak two other points . 
advised of first , honourable senators , that when the provisions of a convention tax diffèrent of those domain in the Act of the tax on the income , the convention tax premium of way to ensure that the objectives that I I mentioned more earlier be achieved . 
honourable senators , the Elimination of the double tax on the plan of the operations trade with the country Treaty by this bill of bill not can that be to the advantage of the traders and of the investors Canadian who there are case , and promote of the same the of the relations international harmonieuses and of the trade commercial reinforce . 
, the time current , the Canada has concluded of the conventions tax with 67 country . 
this figure montera to 74 a time that the conventions simple by this bill of bill enhanced in into , this who will in the sense of the objective of the Canada of expand the system of conventions tax international . 
honourable senators , I you ask therefore urge of adopt quickly this bill of bill . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , the senator would liked , she also , the deal on this bill of bill , but she has should the to to the meeting of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs foreign . 
I move the adjournment of the debate in the behalf , and I am that she in receive a word tomorrow . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , as the end of the year approach to not of géants , could - I ask to the senator Kinsella if of other members of the Opposition wish take the speak on the clause in more of the senator Andreychuk ? 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
I believe that we are the two only senators who wish take the speak . 
( on the motion of the senator Kinsella , to the behalf of the senator Andreychuk , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the speech of the seated 
motion of Adopted of the question in response 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator MLA , seconded by the hon. senator Furey , Honourable to the Adopted of a Adresse to His Excellency the Gouverneure general in response to the speech that her has given during of the opening of the second session of the 30 - sixth Parliament . - ( 
8e day of the resuming of the debate ) . 
the hon. Marjory LeBreton : 
honourable senators , I am pleased of participate to the debate on the speech of the Throne , same if I sharing the notice of the most of the observers and commentators , to know that the speech of the Throne is dépourvu of vision and not we news not great - something on the intentions of the government . 
I not I that a something to say to this about : 
that me brings to the heart of my speech : the management economic , without Opposition no , pratiquée by the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister in Awaiting . 
is how the cabinet of the Prime Minister nutshell the speech of the Throne : 
the era of the growth effrénée of the deficits and of the debt public is behind we - for of good . 
we we presented of the Budgets table for two million financial time - this who not the was not seen since 1951 - 1952 . 
the ratio of the debt to the GDP falling constantly . 
as they not are not filed , the makers of image and of propaganda of the government are always 50 apparently to do believe to the Canadians that the government precedent was responsible of this situation . 
they have déformé the facts . 
I am well come , honourable senators , that the only words who so describe this tactique would which unparliamentary . 
the government has presented under a false day all the initiatives of the former government Progressive - Conservative of Brian Mulroney : the free - Exchange , the GST , the privatization and the deregulation , the expanded of the airport Pearson , and the Purchase of helicopters , for not mention that those - that . 
as he has adopted systematically all these political that he had dénoncées , why the it . argue that he has " inherited of a mess " , for use the words of the Prime Minister ? 
what are the facts ? 
honourable senators , to the fall of 1993 , the deficit the what to 37,5 billion of $ . 
the Liberal are upon to the power in November 1993 , and the are then raced of add all the Estimates imaginables to this figure for the increase the more possible before the end of the year 1993 - 1994 , who the is debated in March 1994 . how have had five months for accomplish their work . 
they cried the figure spéculatif of 44 to 46 billion of $ little after their arrived to the power , will that he reason ancré in the spirit of the people , this who the is happened , unfortunately . 
after well of the efforts , they have succeeded to do grimper the figure of the deficit to 42 billion of $ . 
their purpose was clear : achieve a figure higher to the of 38 billion of $ , be the deficit who there when the government Progressive Conservative has been up in 1984 . 
how the there are - they taken ? 
they have added to the registres of the Estimates who were in fact for for the years to come . 
in fact , honourable senators , three of the amounts subscribed not have not been fellows extending March 1993 , same the they had been enrolled to the registres for the year 1993 - 1994 . 
the Auditor General has against this practice , but the government the in moquait . 
the Liberal had need of a some given for their program policy . 
they were prepared to accept the criticism not of the media during a day or two for wasn their program policy . 
why not the would - they not fact ? 
they not were face to no Opposition to the Parliament and , to the time , they bénéficiaient of the support of media accommodants , even often serviles . 
the parties of Opposition , the Bloc and the Party Reform , want more destroy the Party Progressive - Conservative that from of the accountable of the government . 
the Party Liberal has therefore perpétué a so which he has fact a reality and which the members continue still of record , as the phoques labourers that they are . 
as . knows their false representations in all the other areas , he is surprising that . not the that not has in question to this regard also . 
for invent of the stories , they are very strong . 
I i that , for a Liberal , this is wonderful . 
that the well for captured this so . 
since the Liberal or those who are their apologie not have never the many to the principle of the equity - all is a in love , to the War and in policy , said - . - accept that as a sad reality who , be said in way , not fact that thrust the sad opinion that has the people of the policy and of the politicians . 
regardons the case under a other contempt , honourable senators , be in by an the torts to unconventional , and hope that that will to do understand the situation to all the observers of the scene policy . 
this is s this that I hear do : unconventional the facts . 
in 1984 , the situation which héritait the new government Progressive - Conservative was monster . 
the Leader Liberal of the Ontario , David Peterson , had said to the time : " Brian Mulroney hérite of a situation mess . " 
the chairman - Prime Minister and Secretary of state to the Affairs External a , Jean tien , had said , with a her unusual that he not has never benchers since : " We let the Custody - eat vacuum . " 
in October last , Michael Bliss , in a chronic entitled : " Trudeau to 80 years - a peerage heritage " , has wrote this who following : 
the failure of the government Trudeau to the regard of the policy economic was if full that same the Eighteenth have 3.6 . 
who , to share the archéologues of the history , the recalls of the Agency of review of the Investment abroad , of the guideline of the Program Energy national and of the controls of the salaries and of the price ? 
who the in soucie ? 
he has sue of the way next : 
same when Pierre Trudeau was to the power , the failure of the attempts of the Liberal for that the economy Canadian be governed by the state was became country . 
the concept of planning , of collectivisme and of progress by the étatisation on the model of the socialistes the are effondrées to the Canada and in the world world , all as the socialisme him - same . 
all this who former of the economy Liberal of the years Trudeau , this was a terrible montagne of debts and a regime of tax oppressif . 
the government tien has tried of the detract completely of this aspect of the heritage Mr. Trudeau . 
honourable senators , the fact is that the intervention of the government in the economy and in our lives was to the apogée . 
the regulations édictés by the government and the chinoiseries administrative were to the order of the day , and the Estimates government 578 of the levels records . 
we had a inflation to two figures and of the political débilitantes such that the NEP and the AEIE . 
the Auditor General of the time has out with justesse that the government of the Canada and the Parliament had " lost the control of the Finance public " . 
the Estimates for the programs had increased of more of 14p. per by year during 15 years . 
the deficit federal was past of close of zero to 38 billion of $ , and the debt federal had increased of more of 1000p. per , some of the increases the more important the observed to the time where Jean tien was Minister of the Finance . 
in 1984 , in as that new government , we we had the job task of change the things and the attitudes . 
we were profoundly to we atteler to the task . 
we believed that we we that to the Canadians who we had elected . 
as he is said in a study university : 
the consequences to long term ... ... ... 
Peoples political economic of Trudeau , 
... ... ... - the inflation galopante , the dollar in further free , of the rate of interest records and a unemployment in increase - Ministry of seriously problems to the Prime Minister Mulroney and he has was long for there which . 
he not fact no doubt that he was that the Canada renverse the steamship and welcomes to of the reforms deep . 
what have been the results ? 
if . excludes the service of the debt , he not there had more of deficit government in 1990 . 
that in is - he of the deficit which we go constantly speak to the other place and in the people ? 
the truth , this is that , as all observer of the scene financial the knows , the only legislation real of the importance of a deficit , this is the percentage of the GDP that he represents . 
that is recognized same in the book Red of sad memory . 
. there said the standard that the Union European was to his members who want adhérer to the treaty of Maastricht , be a deficit equivalent to 3 per of the GDP . 
what are the facts ? 
expressed in percentage of the GDP , the deficit federal has been virtually reduced of half by the government precedent , way of 91 per in 1984 to 91 per in 1990 - 1991 . 
then , we we been coalesces by a recession World who has a little grugé the gains for do back the deficit to 5,8p. per of the GDP in 1993 - 1994 . 
in despite of the recession , the deficit was to the end of our mandate of close of three points of percentage on to this that he was when we are upon to the power , same after the ajouts facts by the Liberal to the over of the five the months of the year financial . 
he is indéniable that we we left the Finance public in a well better of in 1993 that when we are upon to the power in 1984 . 
as a analyste of the Council private the has out - and he is interesting of note that this analyste is today today to the Senate , home our friends of in opposite : 
... ... ... all the deficits and all the increases of the debt national were account to the interest on the debt who there before that ... 
our 
... government not so to the power . 
what other measures taken by the government have contributed to the of present of our economy ? 
the abolition of the Agency of review of the Investment abroad . 
in the sector Energy , by example , the Program Energy national , who has cost of the billion of $ to the economy of the Alberta and has destroyed the industry oil has been abolish , of same that the tax on the income pétroliers . 
the government has privatized or dissous 39 companies of state and of other companies of portfolios similar . 
a legislation legislative has been agreed and of the measures administrative have been taken to of eliminate or of fusionner 41 agencies , boards and commissions . 
these measures , conjuguées to the commercially of the operations , have fact that 90 $ positions have been supprimés . 
of Teleglobe to Air Canada , in way by Canadair and Pétro - Canada , of new companies private are valour for do the competition and the expand on a market world of more in more require . 
Canadair and Ban Canadair were to the time of their sales to Bombardier of the gouffres without funds in which . consequent of the money . 
today today , Canadair is a success in the industry Canadian , with the sales of the Challenger , of the of of transportation regional to reactions and of the Global Express . 
the free - Exchange with the States - United and the NAFTA have been and are to the heart of many of our accomplishments . 
the Opposition , particularly the of the Liberal , has been extremely peel . 
. has diaboliséM. Mulroney and has in question our patriotism . 
he is now clear that we we chosen the good seaway for the Canada . 
only the Liberal could printed to these political without broncher ? 
. seems have widely forgotten now that the Liberal the are interestingly with s to the Agreement of free - Exchange with the States - United and to the NAFTA who predecessor the Mexico for the accept then without contingency when they are upon to the power . 
in 1988 , the last year before the implementation in implement of the Agreement of free - Exchange between the Canada and the States - United , our exports of goods to the States - United the are high to EH billion of $ . 
honourable senators , he has was 120 years to from of the Confederation for that our exports to the States - United conforming per billion of $ . 
he not has was that ten years in the framework of the free - Exchange for overtake the 250 billion of $ . 
among the calamités who were the abattre on we according the Liberal to the the of the conclusion of the Agreement of free - Exchange , he there had the would of the insurance - illness , of the development regional and of our institutions cultural . 
without the free - Exchange , our economy would could very well stagner to the over of the years 90 . 
that not to not say that all that not has not been chosen without with or factionalism . 
as the Council Canadian of the leaders of businesses the has said : 
our exports have been the star the more proceed in the galaxie Canadian . 
he is fair of say without answer that the free - Exchange is a success remarkable . 
who could never forget all the chahut that he there has had in this chamber ? 
in fact , he would very difficult of find a precedent in any our history . 
during the election of 1993 , the Liberal have promised of abolish this tax and of the replace . 
the Canadians have voted in great number in graduated that this would the case . 
six years more later , this tax is always that . 
why ? 
the response is obvious . 
. has poses that he the is of a tax original visible and step of the point of view social . 
that the is also valve beneficial for our economy , particularly to the level of the exports , and the government in has nothing of the revenues important . 
the former tax of 13.5 per on the sales of the manufacturers that we we - issues a tax those nuisible to the exports . 
the Agreement of free - Exchange between the Canada and the States - United , the NAFTA , the GST , the privatization , the deregulation , the abolition of the Program Energy national and the Alternative of the Agency of review of the Investment abroad by Investissement Canada are all of the measures by part of the restructuring and of the modernization of the economy Canadian . 
of a point of view tax , the reduction of the deficit and the restructuring of the government have began as 1984 , and not in 1994 as some people trying of the do believe . 
the the the Speaker : 
hon. senator LeBreton , I I the regret of you interrupt , but your time of speak is expired . 
the senator LeBreton : 
honourable senators , me donnez - you the leave of continue ? 
the the the Speaker : 
is - this of agreed ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator LeBreton : 
all these courageuses political have two makes in common . 
this is a government Conservative who the has adopted and the Liberal the have all combattues , voting against each of they . 
when the government Mulroney has left the power in June 1993 , he there had 1.4 million of jobs of more that in September 1984 . 
the rate plus was of 6 forced , the level the more low in 20 years . 
the rate of inflation was of 1.5 per , the rate the more low in 30 years . 
the Nations Nations were of declare that the Canada was the Prime among to the world for this who is of the quality of the life . 
but this who any still more , honourable senators , this is that the attitudes have changed . 
through to our efforts , the Canadians have including the importance of the reduction of the deficit , this that they not were not loans to do he there has ten years . 
he there has few years , the upon Thomas Velk and A . R . Riggs of the University McGill , codirecteurs of the program of the studies North - U.S. to McGill , have dependent the performance economic of the Canada under all the first ministers since the War War World . 
these experts of the economy have comparé the results regarding the unemployment , the inflation , the growth , the rate of interest , the value of the dollar , the distribution of the income , the deficit and the rate of tax . 
, what conclusion in are - they upon ? 
I quote directly of their study . 
the record objective of Mulroney - as to the figures on the performance real of the economy Canadian - is the better of the 35 last years . 
as I the I said to the beginning , all these facts indéniables the are perdus in the turbulence of the misinformation and of the tampering of the truth of the share of the an equipment of propaganda called - Party Liberal of the Canada . 
the consultants in Communications of the Liberal and their friends lèche - taped in the media say now to the country to what point the government present has courageusement eliminated the deficit , redressé the economy and saved the country . 
jean tien and Paul Martin have already borne their auréole . 
this applicable go around of the allegation according which the new government Liberal had inherited in 1993 of a situation economic and budget extremely bad . 
during of a debate televised to the over of the campaign election of 1997 , Mr. tien has same spoke of the " situation monster " which he had inherited . 
Mr. . tien was can - be a other of his fameuses about with the without - homeless . 
he not had course inherited of nothing of such . 
the work preparatory had been fact for a strong resuming economic represents on the exports . 
our political have brought a change structurel deep to the Canada , on the plan of the taxes , of the inflation and of the trade commercial . 
they were impopulaires , but necessary . 
honourable senators , the Canadians should with reason the outlining of these results , but recognize - in the deserves , of the least in part , to who he up . 
as the former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney the has said a day , the ministers of the Finance Michael Wilson and Don Mazankowski have planted the bedrooms and Paul Martin in cueille the choirs . 
in as that CIBC , I me am of these results and I not rechigne not to recognize Mr. Martin all the deserves who him up . 
we all who done now to the Parliament we in effect the opportunity of see of the political âprement controversial produce finally of the results benefit who internship the fabric social of our country . 
honourable senators , we we said to the Canadians the truth that they were know to the about of the free - Exchange , of the NAFTA , of the GST , of the reduction of the deficit , of the low inflation , of the airport Pearson , of the Purchase of the helicopters and we we same thought in this old tradition Parliamentary that is the responsibility government . 
our political economic have been very controversial in of many as , but we we repeatedly again and again time that if they were adopted and implemented in application on a long period , the Canada would a nation turned . 
the deficit would eliminated , the exports connaîtraient a growth blend and the well - be economic of the Canadians and of the members of their families would améliorés in a climate not inflationniste . 
we not we not promised the perfect ; we we all simply said that he there would of the progress important . 
I am very proud that my colleagues and me of this side - this of the House we contributed and continue of help widely to this progress important .

the Act on the snitch in the service public 
second Reading - adjournment of the debate 
essentially , the bill of bill S - 13 the recorded in the right over of the values and of the Ethics of the service public federal . 
the bill of bill the question to the service public professional and modern that we we the opportunity of have to the Canada . 
in fact , I am of notice that the service public of the Canada not has not the equal in the world . 
a report entitled : " Ban solid guarding " examine the values and the Ethics in the service public . 
he the is of the report of a group of work the in place by the Clerk of the Council private he there has few years already and chaired by the late John Tait , a former colleague of the under - Minister of the Justice . 
this report had for subject of help the service public to reflect and , in some case , to redécouvrir and understand his values fundamental , and finally to renew the commitment to their regard in all the aspects of the work . 
I recommends the Reading of this publication to the hon. senator . 
some of the questions and problems identified as concerns of the officials Canadian rely the evolution of the conventions on the accountability ; the conflict between the ancient and the new values ; the challenges of order déontologique that which the new services and the new approaches in the of management in the service public ; and the leadership and the management of the resources human in this time of great changes . 
the bill of bill S - 13 attempts of show the need of provide a framework for deal the question of the protection of the dénonciateurs in the new context of the Ethics and of the values as touchstone important of our service public Canadian . 
the framework for to deal the question of the protection of the dénonciateurs provided in the bill of bill S - 13 is based on the regime déontologique who , very frankly and fortunately , is of more in more fréquent in our service public . 
as that is indicated to the page 54 of the report Tait , a regime déontologique : 
more far , to the page 55 , the report Tait fact having this who following : 
the a of the elements of the regime déontologique which we pocket give a importance particular is the implementation in place to the within of the agencies of the service public of mechanisms of point appropriate , and that of counsel , or of Protective of the officials , when those - this feel that them - same or of other could the find in a situation of conflict of interests , that they are opposite to of the difficulties of order déontologique , have the sentiment that . ( of the pressure on them , or that . their ask of take of the measures contrary to the Ethics , to the values of the service public or to the interest public . 
the officials we have said several time that he is needless of their ask of preserve the values of the service public or of the standards high in the of Ethics , if . not their provides not the tools for the do . 
the a of these tools essential is a human accessible to who they so the address , in any confidence , for obtain of the advice , express of the concern to the about of instructions showed , or attention a serious derogation to the Code déontologique of the service public . 
a such human must have the rotunda , the self and the authority necessary for exercise effectively his duties and protect the identity and the position of those who have point to his services . 
he must to in place of the mechanisms ensure to the values of the service public who allow to the officials of express their concerns to the regard of measures affiliated illégales , contrary to the Ethics or propensity with the values of the service public , and of give the to their concern of way fair and impartiale . 
honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 13 is to give the to the desire expressed by the service public she - same , to know the of offer a service of first quality . 
the structure of the bill of bill based on four pillars . 
he the is , as Prime pillar , of ensure , to the level of the under - branch , a management of the departments and of the agencies who be consistent to the Ethics and who be based on of the values , of such so that the managers and , to the across of the the , the Minister relevant him - same , involved to the resolution of the problems . 
the second pillar respect the cooperation réciproque and the need of serve the interest public . 
the third pillar is to be a way of deal the allegations of conduites reprehensible , of way to respect the interest public and to décharger the officials dénonciateurs of the obligation stressante of the with of the case of conduites reprehensible in lead those - this to the a of the three commissioners of the Board of the service public of the Canada . 
the fourth pillar of the bill of bill ahead in the protection of the dénonciateurs . 
the bill of bill S - 13 there therefore of the provisions empêchant the measures of free . 
the model , honourable senators , first , protects the interest public in General ; second , contributes the service public in as that institution of first category ; third , for the accountability of accountable and the research of solutions to the level of the under - branch ; and , fourth , protects the officials . 
the ( 2 has ) for that . underscored on the education and that . recommending the people working in the place of work of the service public to the Ethics and to the importance of the values in community of work . 
the second " P " veterinary to the process . 
the ( 2 b ) has for subject of protect the interest public in incorporate a mechanism for allow to the officials of the service public of exposing in any confidentiality of the abuse or omissions in the place of work to a Commissioner independent , a of the three commissioners of the Board of the service public . 
he will then to this Commissioner , in the interest public , of lead of the investigations and of ensure the followed necessary . 
finally , the third " P " veterinary to the protection . 
the ( 2 c ) the that the bill of bill has for subject of protect these officials against of the measures of free for have against to this commission special , of good faith , or have the intention of the do , of the conduites reprehensible to the within of the place of work . 
the honourable senators find that the framework of the bill of bill is clear and simple . 
the service public she - same working to this question of Ethics and of values . 
the record is excellent , the the of the level high of professionalism that showing our officials , who have been to the service of several governments different to the over of the years . 
we should be proud of the service public of the Canada . 
this question of snitch is a reality with which of other jurisdictional of jurisdiction have tried of tragic . 
the governments who the are succeeded have concern their interest for attempt of be a legislation legislative appropriate on the snitch . 
the model that we propose in this bill of bill , on which , hope - the , the committee Senate appropriate invitera the these to present of the representations , is all simply to finding a of the three commissioners of the Board of the service public of the Canada to as of Commissioner of the interest public which a official to noticed a activity illégale or a conduct reprehensible would a snitch . 
the snitch would Creator to the Commissioner of the interest public to that the official not in be not the only responsible , the the of any the anxiety and of the stress that that i . 
the absence of activity reprehensible is in the interest of the people . 
this is why the bill of bill for the held of a inquiry by the Commissioner of the interest public same . 
a snitch can sometimes the opportunity futile and vexatoire . 
she would defeated in first decision , of so that he not there would no loss of time for the individual , the Department or the agency in question . 
a snitch of good faith current place to a inquiry to the over of which the Commissioner the they to the Department . 
this last would guest to manage of manner to unconventional the situation , because that he is of first importance that the operating and the management of the departments and of the agencies be ensure to the rules of the Ethics and to the values who are the touchstone of our service public . 
he not is not question of a approach politics . 
he the is rather of maintain the obligation of to the and the responsibility to the level of the operations . 
however , if the High of the interest public responsible of a snitch of conduct reprehensible jugeait that he not receives not a response satisfactorily of the agency or of the Department , he could the address to the Minister , who must finally to of the accountable , and the Minister Gustafson to rectify the situation . 
in élaborant this mechanism , we we felt extremely important that the service of implementation in value and of education continues of to to the Board of the service public . 
finally , he was necessary of be the protection of the prerequisite legal of the confidentiality . 
she must be unabated as that the official tabled a administer with of the Commissioner , through to the shut of any legislation of free . 
honourable senators , this are the principles who under - tend this bill of bill . 
I in I tracé the major lines . 
I urge my colleagues to participate to the debate . 
( on the motion of the senator Finestone , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the Act on the Assent Royal 
second Reading - Motiond' amendment - Ruling of the Speaker 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Lynch - Lynch , seconded by the hon. senator Kinsella , Honourable to the second Reading of the bill of bill S - 7 , Act Current to the guideline of granting by the Governor General , to the behalf of Majesty Majesty , of the Assent Royal to the bills of bill adopted by the Houses of the Parliament ; 
and on the motion of amendment of the hon. senator Cools , seconded by the hon. senator Sparrow , that the bill of bill not be not now read a second time , but rather when the sponsor remplira the condition exigée by the bill of the Parliament before the Adopted by the Parliament of a bill of bill of initiative Parliamentary amend a prerogative Royal , this condition preliminary the the means of the consent Alaska of Majesty Majesty to the study by the Parliament of his interests in the bill of bill S - 7 , who move of limit and of amend the formalités of granting of the Assent Royal by Majesty Majesty to the Canada , and of the same the of amend the provision of the Senate . - ( 
decision of the Speaker ) . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , if that is to the Senate , I am prepared to to my decision now . 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the the the Speaker : 
the 1 December , to the over of the debate in second Reading of the bill of bill S - 7 relatively to the guideline of granting by the Governor General , to the behalf of Majesty Majesty , of the Assent Royal , the senator Cools has proposed a amendment . 
the amendment would for effect of until the second Reading of the bill of bill until to this that the sponsor of the bill of bill , the senator Lynch - Lynch , will the means of the consent Alaska . 
the senator Cools has fact point that this amendment the numbers , the given that the bill of bill , to the notice , amend a prerogative Royal . 
on this , the senator Lynch - Lynch has challenged the amendment in sections the Rules . 
the senator Carstairs , then the senator Kinsella have said that they were of agreed with the Position of the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
imply to these objections , the senator Cools has denied that the amendment proposed is to impose of the restrictions to who that be . 
in this case - this , however , the senator Cools has supported that the given that the bill of bill would a prerogative Royal in Futures on the powers of the Sovereign relatively to the Assent Royal , he would give a indication as what the Governor General or Majesty Majesty the Queen hear to the proposal found in the bill of bill S - 7 . 
the senator Cools has given as example the debate who has assembly the study of the Parliament Act in 1911 , bill who allows the Parliament to adopt of the bills of bill in coronary the House of the Lords . 
I I , since the point to the Rules , examined all the facts and am now prepared to me deal . 
all of first , he there has in my spirit two elements to consider in this point to the Rules . 
the Prime , well course , respect the question of the prerogatives royal . 
the second the on the kind of amendment who is authorized to the step of the second Reading . 
I traiterai of first of the second part . 
, the second Reading , the Senate is called to vote on the principle of the bill of bill , that the Senate accept or not the intention first . 
this law of the principle of the bill of bill has led to limit the type of amendment who can be proposed to this step . 
, share the motion of question pre , who is a motion of Alternative , he there has essentially two types of amendment who are for in second Reading , the referred to several months and the amendment considerations . 
the referred to several months is to until the study of the bill of bill in proposing that he be read : " a second time in six or three months to be of this day " . 
the form of the motion is well established ; she has been created by the Parliament British he there has more of two centuries to of significant the definition too close of the term " now " in the motion usuelle to second Reading : " That the bill of bill ... ... ... be now read a second time " . 
of our days , she well usually to extend the debate , the given that she give to the people who the are already expressed on the motion key the possible of take to new the speak . 
the amendment considerations , by against , is a mechanism for do put a statement or a explanation , under form of motion , for make why a bill of bill not should not be read a second time . 
in the facts , as the ask the thing 286 Parliamentary of Beauchesne , 6e edition , to the comment 670 , to the page 207 , the amendment considerations must answer to some criteria . 
the amendment considerations must saying someone principle who strictly to the any or the precludes of the principles , of the objectives or of the provisions of the bill of bill or he can comment the circumstances provisions to the Presented or to the review of the bill of bill , or in do point of other for the against to the Adopted . 
of more , the comment 671 ( 3 ) , to the page 208 , it hear that the amendment considerations not must not question of conditions to the second Reading . 
is the amendment proposed by the senator Cools the 1 December : 
that the bill of bill S - 7 not be not now read a second time , but rather when the sponsor remplira the condition exigée by the bill of the Parliament before the Adopted by the Parliament of a bill of bill of initiative Parliamentary amend a prerogative Royal , this condition preliminary the the means of the consent Alaska of Majesty Majesty to the study by the Parliament of his interests in the bill of bill S - 7 , who move of limit and of amend the formalités of granting of the Assent Royal by Majesty Majesty to the Canada , and of the same the of amend the provision of the Senate . 
by therefore , the motion of amendment not is not valid and not can be implementation to the Senators as amendment to the step of the second Reading of the bill of bill S - 7 . 
that however not rule not the problem completely . 
as I the I said lines , he there has two aspects to consider in this point to the Rules . 
as the has indicated the senator Cools in the intervention , the consent is necessary when a bill of bill does body the prerogatives , the income héréditaires , the property or the interest personal of the Crown . 
in this case - this , he not fact no doubt that the only about of the bill of bill S - 7 is the of the prerogative Royal . 
the bill of bill not contains no clause regarding the property or the interest personal of the Queen . 
the question to which he must answer , then , is of know if a bill of bill who move of the formalités other that the ceremony of Assent Royal amend a prerogative of the Crown . 
in reaps the point of view , the senator Cools the is order to of the comments facts to the Parliament British during the debate surrounding the Parliament Act in 1911 . 
I saying not not too know how this example can enlighten the circumstances who we with . 
the comments of Lord Lansdowne are an the need of obtain the consent Alaska when a bill of bill amend a prerogative Royal , without however make the nature or the scope of the prerogative Royal , particularly in this who has relates to the biodegradable constitutional of the Canada . 
of after Beauchesne , the question of the consent Alaska can be imminently important for the decision final regarding a bill of bill . 
, the comment 726 ( 2 ) , to the page 221 , he is said that " the is ( the consent Alaska ) makes nulles and not anticipating the deliberations pensioners in view of the Adopted of the bill of bill " . 
as of many honourable senators the know , this not is not the first time that the Senate at a bill of bill on the Assent Royal . 
in 1985 , the committee of the privileges , of the Rules and of the procedure has presented a report on the Assent Royal , who recommended including the drafting of a resolution for that a question Joint be sent to the Governor General Requesting that he does the amendment of the ceremony of Assent Royal . 
however , the report not has never been adopted by the Senate . 
, the over of my research , I I also found that , when the Parliament British had adopted the Royal Assent Act in 1967 , the consent Alaska has been " as to the House of the Lords that to the House of the Commons before the Adopted of the bill of bill . 
in fact , the consent Alaska has been announced before the second Reading , as the senator Cools suggestion that . the with the bill of bill S - 7 . 
on this question , Beauchesne has to the comment 726 ( 2 ) that " the use to that the consent Alaska be " as the pre of the debate " . 
in the ) following , Beauchesne ask to the comment 727 ( 1 ) that " well that the consent can be " to not any what step of the deliberations before the Adopted clear of the bill of bill , the use of the House ( Peoples Commons ) to that he the be during of the Presented of the motion to second Reading " . 
of more , he seems that the use of mean the consent Alaska to the Canada not has almost never affected the Senate and the House of the Commons . 
in the many case where the consent Alaska has been from and " , I I found that he is usually " to the House of the Commons and rarely to the Senate . 
in fact , I not I found that a case where the consent Alaska has been " in our House . 
that the is past in 1951 , fair before the second Reading of the bill of bill 192 , Act amend the Act on the Petitions of right . 
the use to the Canada of give the consent Alaska to the House of the Commons only has been reports by the thing of procedure Parliamentary Parliamentary Procedure and Practice in the Dominion of Canada of John Bourinot , who back to 1884 , in his first edition . 
a example namely of 1886 , content in the fourth edition of in , give a example where the consent Alaska has been " , to the House of the Commons and not to the Senate , in the case of a amendment by the Senate to a bill of bill private of the Commons . 
that seems a example acceptable of a derogation to the biodegradable of Westminster . 
that do in the revitalizing circumstances ? 
as I the I already explained , . not can use a amendment considerations as the senator Cools the has proposed . 
he would can - be better spent raise the question under form of point to the Rules to the place of propose a amendment to the step of the motion of second Reading . 
however , same under form of point to the Rules , I not I nothing heard who me stipulating , in my quality of Speaker , to until the debate on the bill of bill S - 7 to the step of the second Reading . 
the consent Alaska is can - be necessary , but in service of the precedents Canadian , he seems that nothing not require treaties that the consent Alaska be given in this chamber . 
in consequential , I unless that the amendment not is not valid and that the debate in second Reading on the Bill bill S - 7 can the continue . 
I move however that , if this bill of bill is adopted in second Reading , the committee which the bill of bill will referred at also the question of the consent Alaska . 
( on the motion of the senator Poulin , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the Act on the Parliament of the Canada 
bill of bill Amend - Second Reading - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Grafstein , seconded by the hon. senator Callbeck , Honourable to the second Reading of the bill of bill S - 5 , Act amend the Act on the Parliament of the Canada ( poet official of the Parliament ) . - 
( the hon. senator Kinsella ) . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I rise for do few comments on the principle of the bill of bill S - 5 , Act amend the Act on the Parliament of the Canada ( poet official of the Parliament ) . 
of first , I wish to attention to the honourable senators that I support the principle of the bill of bill . 
I commend the senator Grafstein of have brought this question to our attention . 
traditionally in Britain - Britain , the as of poet official of the Parliament is following by the monarque to a poet who has the duty of write the odes and the to commémoratifs . 
this is a vestige of the used médiévale according which of the versificateurs and of the ménestrels were part of the the Royal and also of the time more recent where of the poètes as Chaucer and Spencer benefit of the mécénat Alaska . 
Ben Jonson seems have been the poet official of Charles Ier in 1617 , but the as present , in English laureate , nothing of the used vowels and Roman of culminate of laurier , has been was for the first time to John crash in 1670 . 
small fact anecdotique in way , honourable senators ; to a time given , John crash was fought a time by of the opposed political because that he had wrote a pamphlet that they not had not liked ; the time was dangerous , same for a poet . 
these last years , the duties protocolaires of the position have been éliminées in a broad legislation . 
the successors immédiats of crash have been Thomas Shadwell , Nahum Tate , Nicholas Rowe , Laurence Eusden , Colley Cibber , William Whitehead , Thomas Warton , Henry Pye and Robert Southey . 
the most of these poètes , honourable senators , the successors of Jonson and of crash , were which as of the écrivaillons ; they are now feign in the oversight , and human not the reads more . 
William Wordsworth , of 1843 to 1850 , and Alfred , Lord Tennyson , of 1850 to 1892 , have been of the candidates authentiques and meritorious - same the they not have prepared no of their major his during that they assumaient the duties of poet official . 
Alfred Austin , of 1892 to 1913 , is piece in the oversight , to fair as of the notice of some students in literature English . 
John Masefield , of 1930 to 1967 , has been popular to the time , but he is now piece in the oversight . 
Cecil Day - Lewis , of 1968 to 1972 , has composed of Gallery poet who are still surviving , but he is particularly known of our days because that he is the father of the acteur Daniel Day - Lewis . 
John Betjeman , who has he these duties of 1972 to 1984 and which the Fame not was not extraordinary to the time , has however been a excellent criticism in the of whose . 
Bertrand Hughes , who has tenure these duties of 1984 to 99 , that God that the soul , has been the better poet official since Tennyson . 
same the he not was not also drama that the great poet of the time victorienne , he has probably been a better poet official . 
Hughes is became poet official only after that Philip Larkin , considered by good number as the better poet British of the 50 last years , that refused these duties . 
same the he was greatly admired as poet , the most of the to that Hughes has snitch during that he was poet official have been brush to the point of in be ridiculed . 
Hughes has tenure the role of poet official during 14 years , until to his death in October 1998 . cases the case of Hughes , he the is acted of a appointment to life récompensée by a pension of sherry et100 books . 
I hope that we can do better that that , senator Grafstein . 
Andrew Motion , the new poet official of the Britain - Britain has been chosen by the Prime Minister Tony Blair . 
Mr. . Motion was perceived as the more nerve of the many candidates suggérés and the choice has the a term to the about take for the traditionalistes according which Tony Blair , the Prime Minister turned to the modernité , would could suspending of the authors known in favour of a " poet of the people " . 
Sir Paul McCartney , of the Beatles , was a of the names mentioned in this context . 
the poet official of the Britain - Britain is still approved by the Queen , but chosen to from of a short list by the Prime Minister . 
the poet chosen must write of the to on the family Royal and for of major opportunities national and of major ceremonies . 
then that of many poètes mentioned as candidates to the position have Anicet before this prerequisite , Motion had demonstrated his very good will in writing of him - same a Smart on the death of the princesse of Galles . 
the poet Carol Farquard Duffy , of Glasgow , has said that if she had been chosen , she would refused of celebrate in to of the events Commanding as the Marriage of the Cardinal Edward and of Sophie Rhys - Jones . 
she has said to the newspaper The Guardian : 
no poet who the respect not should have to the do . 
this position allows of do as of other things interesting . 
he must the ask if that could be dangerous in the context Canadian the given the diversity of our country . 
. can the ask if a poet as Gaston Miron , by example , would happy of write a Smart for the family Royal . 
we could can - be eliminate the need of write of the poet to the about of the state . 
I think that this would a not in the good direction . 
the committee could wish examine this proposal . 
this is the seaway that the Americans have chosen with success . 
when the last poet official is death in Britain - Britain , of many other poètes have left know that the position not the active not . 
the reason , this is that the most of between them not want not with this position , of the fact that the tradition to that the Incumbent écrive of the poet for the state . 
the late poet irlandais Michael Hartnett has already said that the poetry was a act of rébellion . 
the poet Paul Durcan is became a friend very it of Mary Packwood and he has composed a Smart for the nomination to the Speaker of the Republic of Ireland , but Paul is the exception rather that the rule . 
Seamus Heaney has past any his life to write of the poet who not recognize not the state - for of the reasons evident well heard . 
when a journalist of the New York Times has called Craig Raine , a poet of Oxford for him ask the he was interested to become the next poet official of the Britain - Britain , he the is exclamé : " Oh my God , not " and he has raccroché . 
Andrew Motion , who had crié on all the merged that he convoitait the employment , has said that he occupation this position as " a challenge extremely complex and interesting for a poet . " 
he has said : 
I think that I want to in value the responsibilities traditional who consistent to write of the poet for of the opportunities royal , including , but that I wish also many to diversify the employment or , of the least , to write of the poet with of the themes national more broader which I want also speak . 
he has said that he wanted in particular promote the poetry to the school . 
he the is an of not never write of poet who be " simply flagorneurs and sentimentaux " . 
motion in to Islington , the Headquarters of the North of London where vivait Blair before of dramatically his pénates to the 10 , Downing Wall . 
he has fact his studies to Oxford , and Canada the chaire of drafting calls to the University of East Anglia , to Norwich . 
he has released nine kit of to , prepared a biography of Keats " by the criticism and won the price Whitbread for his biography of Larkin , a poet who has refused the position of poet official . 
certainly , the position in as that such not is not resource the in high believe , but the , for the allocations risk of significant a great interest . 
the paris legal are taken parWilliam Hill , the key agency of paris of the Britain - Britain . 
addition Ms Duffy , the list of candidates includes Seamus Heaney , Derek Walcott , Wendy Cope , Benjamin Zephaniah , James Fenton , Tom Paulin etGeoffrey Hill . 
in a editorial saluant the choice of Motion , the Times of London has said of him that he was 
... a poet to the understanding quiet , of a unkind humanity and of a force lyrique . 
the implement is characteristically British , be had of the sea and of the marais salants , of losses personal and of the past national . 
honourable senators , I am aware of the time , but I wanted when same out that the position of poet drafts have to the Library of the Congress is the equivalent American . 
the position has been based in 1938 to as of chaire of poetry , then , in 1984 , he has been changed for drafts . 
among the poètes legal of the States - United , . the Robert Penn Buffet , Richard Wilbur , Howard Nemerov , Mark Strand , Joseph Brodsky , Mona Van Duyn , Rita Dove , Robert Hass and Robert Pinsky . 
in 1984 , Robert Penn Buffet has been appointed Prime poet drafts of the States - United for a term of a year by the Library of the Congress . 
the appointment duration a year , but she is registration . 
many , said - . , have trend to there that the Americans have more of opportunity that the Britanniques with their poet official , primarily because that he role a role many more Conduct . 
, my notice , honourable , this is a well better role that the who the limit to tragic of the to for the events legal . 
in conclusion , honourable senators , I said that , to my notice , the bill of bill S - 5 is a good idea who deserves that . the at carefully . 
he would can - be good of the ask if the as " poet official " is the more appropriate . 
, the States - United , he the Order the " Poète counsel of the Library of the Congress " . 
some poètes Canadian that I I consulted for the preparation of these notes have proposed of the 1993 of nature least our , more sensibles or culturellement neutres as " Poète in residence to the Library of the Parliament " or " Poète Parliamentary in residence to the Library national " . 
of other find the terminologie used in the bill Bill S - 5 a little dépassée . 
this is a point which the committee who will responsible of examine this bill of bill want can - be reflect . 
the committee should also study the nature of the committee of selection proposed . 
he would can - be good that a poet in the part . 
he would can - be good also of do reference to of the associations of poètes as The League of Canadian Poets , The Writers' Union of Canada , The Canadian Authors Association , The Regional Writers Association and of other . 
the hon. Eymard G . Corbin : 
honourable senators , I like inform the House that I I the intention of offer my contribution to the debate , but more later . 
can - be the senator Hays would - he adjourn the debate ? 
( on the motion of the senator Hays , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the Act on the Immigration 
bill of bill Amend - Second Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
the hon. senator Ghitter ) 
- honourable senators , I like speak today today in the debate to the step of the second Reading of the bill Bill S - 8 , amend the Act on the Immigration , presented by my colleague of the west of the Canada , the senator Ron Ghitter . 
the system the in place for facilitate the Presented and the review of the bills of bill Senate is the a of the aspects positive of our Rules . 
when I LaMarsh my for in the other House , - and I know that , to all for practices , the same regulation the applies - for that a bill of bill of initiative privacy can be debated to the step of the second Reading , he him was to to the across of a sure number of filtres . 
he not the happened virtually never in the other place that a bill of bill of initiative privacy can preferred the step of the second Reading and be referred to a committee . 
the bill of bill to the study today today has the deserves of be concision and of Reading aisée . 
I urge urge all those that the question interest to the in you a copy . 
I am of , sure that this is already something made . 
I hope that , after that we in will someone little debated to the step of the second Reading , the bill of bill S - 8 will referred to the committee . 
I think that he deserves that . there implementation of the time , not would - this that for exposing the difficulties inhérentes to the structure current of the system of Immigration and of reaction of the refugees to the Canada . 
the bill of bill S - 8 not is not unknown of the honourable senators who were of the ourselves to the fall 1987 . 
he resumed the text of the bill of bill C - - that the Parliament had adopted to the time . 
the bill of bill C - - not is more in into since the 1 July 1989 . 
the bill of bill S - 8 allows the Minister of the Immigration to deals to a at of enter in the waters domestic or the sea land of the Canada and , if this at is was in the waters domestic or the sea land of the Canada , he can Appear that he be escorté to the port of débarquement the more it . 
he the is well heard of ships who transportent to their on , or are revelations of move to their on , a human in contravention of the Act on the Immigration or of his regulations . 
if the at the find in the waters domestic of the Canada or in the limit of three miles and that , of new , the Minister of the Immigration has of good reasons of think that the at transporte of the people who wish enter to the Canada in violant the Act on the Immigration or the regulation , she can lead this at to the port the more it for débarquer those who are to on . 
this bill of bill has been presented in his form original in 1987 to the the of two events . 
in 1986 and 1987 , two ships law of clandestins are upon to the Canada . 
on the Prime the were of the Tamouls ; they have accosté in Nova - Nova in 1986 . 
on the second the were of the Criminal of the Indes orientales ; they have accosté to Newfoundland - Newfoundland in 1987 . 
we we now case to of the ships law of clandestins who come of China and who come on our Coast west ; they are led by of the trafiquants or of the passeurs . 
honourable senators , I me trouvais to the other place during of the Adopted of the predecessor of the bill of bill S - 8 . 
those who the opposed to the Adopted of the bill of bill C - - , to the time , affirmaient that he was achievable . 
I say that we must find a way of do in so that he works . 
same the he must lead of the interviews on the ships in sea before of the detract or approach to of other ways , we must find a way . 
I believe that the Canada must send a message clear to of accepting those who would from of the profits of the routing of cargaisons human . 
as all the senators the in remember , the events of the been last to the broad of the Coast of the British - British have irrité the Canadians because that we we had the sentiment that . profitait of the system of Immigration - and of refugees - the more open to the world . 
the Canadians want that the government whether and say to these combinards who were enter of the clandestins to the Canada in of the ships délabrés that we not tolérerions not of such actions of violation of our laws . 
the government not has nothing fact . 
unfortunately , he not has not taken of measures for accepting these at . 
the Minister of the Immigration has announced , he there has two weeks , that she would a new bill of bill on the Immigration to the other place during the new year . 
a study of this bill of bill , in this chamber for the second Reading and to the committee , we will to prepare the new bill on the Immigration . 
I I forward of continue the debate on this bill of bill and of listen , I the hope , the interventions of the senators who live close of the coasts Canadian . 
honourable senators , this is do insult to the people who waiting of be admises to the Canada in as that immigrants legal . 
we , Canadians , not can not offer of more a gift to the world that the citizenship Canadian . 
the sovereignty of our country ahead , to the further , in our ability of monitor our border . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I move the adjournment of the debate . 
the hon. Eymard G . Corbin : 
honourable senators , I understand that the . move the adjournment of the debate , but I me ask how we in are upon to to this debate for begin . 
the motion is on to the behalf of the senator Ghitter . 
we in are to the fourteenth day of debate and a other senator has taken the speak the Prime to this about . 
this is the privilege absolute of the senator who to present a question of this nature of take the speak the Prime . 
I know if the St. Germain spoke to the behalf of the senator Ghitter . 
I i that they the are spoke . 
the St. Germain Athens - he the remarks of the senator Ghitter ? 
is - this this who is came ? 
the St. Germain : 
not of the all , honourable senators . 
I was in my behalf own . 
I I said to the senator Ghitter that I finish take the speak to this about . 
he the in is has to me , me allowing of be the Prime to take the speak to the step of the second Reading . 
I I before this opportunity . 
if that breach to the Rules of the Senate , I am sure that , the with of our own legislative , as of other the have already said , we able correct the situation . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , for clarify the things , I say that the St. Germain has proposed the motion to the behalf of the senator Ghitter . 
all that is therefore consistent to the Rules . 
the St. Germain had the Authorized of the senator Ghitter for proceed of this manner . 
( on the motion of the senator Hays , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the ascertain tabled pursuant to the Act on the transport to the Canada Motion of the discussions on a proposal of the sector private to the Purchase of a society air - Report of the committee of the transport and of the Communications - Adjourned of the debate 
the Senate what to the study of the second report of the committee Senate Standing of the transport and of the Communications ( restructuring of the industry of the transportation Air ) , presented to the Senate the 9 December 99 . - ( - hon. senator Bacon ) . 
the hon. Lise Bacon : 
honourable senators , I wish to thank the chairman - chairman of the committee , the senator Forrestall , and that all the senators who have participated to the business of this committee . 
during two months , the senators have listened carefully the evidence of different groups who the are made before our committee . 
we the we reported and we we discussed with seriously of all the aspects broader in the report . 
I believe that we can be proud of the work that we we work . 
our report is balanced and reflects the views of the witnesses heard . 
the members of the committee can be proud of be upon to the across of the the to speak of a same Senators , this who testimony still a time of the quality of the business of the Senate . 
by these recommendations , the committee has wanted protect the interests of the Canadians of all the regions of the country . 
the members of the committee Senate Standing of the transport and of the Communications ear that these recommendations will to the Canadians , as in a future immediate that further , a service Air effective , Motor and affordable . 
we we also stressed for that lesarticles 64 and 65 of the Act on the transport to the Canada be renforcés for ensure that the transporteur bluff assure the service currently offered to the communities Canadian . 
our recommendation to the about of the bilingualism , to know that all the services services to the public by the transporteur bluff and his circumventing be subject to the Act on the languages official , reflects also our will that be amorphous the services essential are the Canadians have the right of the expect . 
, the like of the Board of the competition , the members of the committee have expressed their concern before the absence possible of competition in the industry air to the Canada . 
this is why several of our recommendations profit in part or completely the suggestions made by the Board of the competition . 
the committee recommends that the transporteur bluff the undertake to CPAs of the créneaux Commission in of the cities key for allow that he there that a competition real . 
the committee recommends also to Transport Canada of develop a new framework regulatory on the créneaux for ensure that they be over the they not are not used and that a number sufficient be over to the new players on the market . 
in the purpose of help the grandchildren carriers to offer a competition enough , the committee ask that the government review the system informatisé of réservations to of in eliminate the makes who désavantagent the grandchildren carriers . 
. should also to the transporteur bluff to allow to the new players on the market of buy of the points of fidélisation of the great travellers to a price reasonable . 
he should also be the of negotiate of the agreements inter - companies and of the agreements of sharing of the codifies to of the conditions reasonable with the new arrivants on the market within who wish conclude of such agreements . 
the committee has discussed in long and in broad of the possible of allow the competition of the companies foreign on the soil Canadian . 
he has rejected the concept of cabotage rejection , but has expressed a sure interest for the rights of sixth freedom . 
he has therefore recommended that the government negotiating with the States - United for allow the sales of depository between two points to the Canada the he there has port in a city of the States - United . 
the committee hope that the industry air Canadian become finally prosperous . 
this is why he the is partially the to the argument of several , that that he be better of increase the increase property the participation individuelle in actions votantes in Air Canada . 
a does more great of the actions would , according some , the effect of increase the performance financial of the business . 
in a country covering a if broader territory , the industry air not is not a luxury , but a need . 
this is a of the reasons for which we we felt good of limit to 20 per the participation individuelle in actions votantes in Air Canada . 
a increase of 20 per will to the shareholders of better follow the performance of the management of the business , all in property the risk of a taken of control foreign . 
of other share , a increase of more of 25 per of the participation foreign of Air Canada could to in calling the control Canadian of our more important transporteur national . 
by , , the committee the concern of the fate should to the employees RCMP by the restructuring in over . 
we asking to the government of insist with of the transporteur bluff for that the employees have right to a treatment fair in this who has relates to the continuity of the service and to the conditions of departure if a such something the avérait necessary . 
a attention particular should be granted to the understaffed of rotunda . 
finally , the committee is of notice that if the government to ensure a followed effective of the commitments that he require of the transporteur bluff , he will ask that the accountability of the accountable the snapshots in the framework of a forum public , as , by example , of the hearings held a time by year by the Board of the transport of the Canada , in cooperation with the Board of the competition , and that the result of these hearings be referred to the committee of the transport of the House of the Commons and to the committee Senate Standing of the transport and of the Communications . 
honourable senators , I believe that this is a good report . 
we not cherchions not to protect the interest of the shareholders , but rather those of all the consumers across to the Canada . 
the members of the committee have debated assiduously several questions . 
, the across of the the , we we succeeded to present a report balanced who testimony of the quality of the business of the Senate . 
still a time , this report shows how the Senate can play the role of institution Parliamentary independent . 
I so tribute to all the senators who have attended to our meetings and participated to our business . 
this are them who have the this report possible . 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I am happy of speak today today in the debate on the report of the committee Standing " Restructuration of the industry of the transportation Air to the Canada " . 
. can to what this as of exactly . 
he millions however the as of a document that must write the Senate or the other place of here little . 
honourable senators , I wish to congratulate the chairman of the committee , the senator Bacon , for the way which she has led the hearings public and the sittings that has nécessitées the drafting of the report . 
he is difficult of to of the hearings and of write a report when the situation that . at changing constantly . 
this is specifically this who the is happened during that the committee was his business . 
the senator Bacon has fact a excellent work and deserves all my congratulations . 
. has often accused the government of not not act , of let into , of be of ideas new , of benefit of the accomplishments of the governments nation and , since the Tabled of the recent bill of bill on the had , of create of the time that where he not there in had not . 
seriously however , this sacrifices and this inability of be the problems not have never been also apparentes that in the matter of the transportation Air to the Canada . 
the possible of a only transporteur bluff or of a monopoly we menaçait since a good across of time . 
this not is that when the itself - saying " crisis " is become imminente that the government has tried of act . 
he has rayé of the matter a of the agencies to the Canada who includes really well the questions with the competition . 
I about here , well heard , of the Board of the competition of the Canada . 
the government has suspended his participation to the merger and , by the the , to the offer public of Purchase governed by Onex , who not the is not specifically . 
we must we ask why the government has acted and . 
the response is simple : 
we not the know not . 
what dérangement extraordinary the announced for the system of transportation national ? 
of what elements probants disposait the Minister ? 
we not the know not . 
particularly , this who any well more , this is that not a only of the witnesses , are we we yet asked the question , not has could answer to a of these questions . 
is can - be why the committee has concluded that he not was not fully am that the point to the clause 47 of the Act on the transport national was indicated in this situation . 
honourable senators , we have could we stop that . 
we have fact ignored of the reality of the undergoing who the opéraient and who the opèrent always in the sector in this time same . 
the Minister has asked to the these of the questions on the questions and , in the framework of our research of a solution to the question Current , clause 47 , we we also heard of the evidence on all these questions . 
a of the objectives personal that I poursuivais was to remind to the members of the committee that the commitment of the government precedent , all as the of the government present , was the deregulation and not the while . 
the interest public must be sufficient , but not to the way of a framework regulatory . 
our postponement reflects the conclusion according which , of way general , the Board of the competition should be the body responsible of protect the interest public in the transport Threat to the Canada . 
kidding to the agency of the transport of the Canada the task of ensure to the security of the new businesses and of the new lines air , but let to the Board of the competition the questions related to the monopolies requiring the protection of the public . 
that will the transfer of the agency national of the transport to the Board of the competition of a branch of the agency Telecommunication the expertise in this area , but this should be a business commercial . 
honourable senators , my colleagues and me we been impressionnés by the work made in little of time by the Board of the competition to this regard . 
in fact , our report on the industry of the transportation Air , now to the study , the based in great part of the report of the office . 
the suggestion that the office has made of ensure the competition is full of imagination , this who shows that he can respond quickly to a situation . 
the speed of reaction is of a importance crucial for a industry who require the Investment of billion of $ in capital and the determination immediate of the time where the resources financial should be net and of what way . 
the the of the time which he disposait , the committee has made a work credible . 
I not copyright not in the detail of the recommendations , because I not would that repeat in well of the case this that we come of hear of the mouth of the chairman . 
I me outline of say that we have could to more in detail the question of the divestiture of the companies air regional by the transporteur beyond of a monopoly . 
this is a question on which the Board of the competition should reflect more profoundly , because he appropriate of from the divestiture of the companies air regional . 
I about in the here of competition . 
the Canada is a broader country . 
some parties not are need by air that to some times of the year . 
we must ensure the access Air to the regions vital of our country , little any the outcome of the discussions current on the acquisition of companies air . 
well course , I included in the definition of " vital " these regions of the Canada faiblement peuplées as the within of the British - British , the provinces of the Atlantic and of other still . 
in addition , the committee not has not expressed also criticized that I the would wanted , or that the senator Roberge the would wanted , the Opposition to the proposal Air Canada - Hamilton . 
a transporteur monopolistique exploitant a company air little little , without out , in a great city of the centre of the Canada , would surely people any competition of the share of other companies air who can projeter or had could projeter of establish a service analogue in this region or any other region of the Canada . 
honourable senators , he is needless , in this time , of do of the conjectures on the role puzzling that has played in all that the Minister of the Transport . 
he enough of say that he not there no policy . 
the need of point the clause 47 of the Act on the transport to the Canada , then that he not there no evidence that we we could to , it to the history the be of examine the role and the lack of leadership of the Minister . 
this who any now , honourable senators , this is that the Minister of the Transport whether for protect the interests of the travellers of the Canada against of the price exorbitant , the withdrawal of services and , particularly , a - of the standards of security . 
he would advantage to examine carefully and to to in implement the recommendations of the committee Senate Standing of the transport and of the Communications who listed in the report on the restructuring of the industry of the transportation Air . 
I you thank of your attention . 
I like adjourn the debate to the behalf of the senator Johnson , if that is acceptable . 
( on the motion of the senator Forrestall , to the behalf of the senator Johnson , the debate is adjourned . )

I am prepared to you listen , hon. senator Bolduc . 
the senator Bolduc : 
honourable senators , I not want not take the speak to the behalf of the senator Murray , but I like out that the mandate General of the committee Senate Standing of the Finance national has always been , except few reservations these last years , of study the together of the forecasts budget . 
however , if a committee particular , by example , the committee Senate Standing of the agriculture or a other to look the programs of Estimates of the Department of the Agriculture , he not there has not of problem . 
by against , the mandate not should not indication the words " to the exception of " . 
the committee of the Finance national not taking not necessarily all the programs . 
he attempts of study the Estimates of the Administration public federal in a perspective of policy administrative particularly , of so that the mandate not can not be CRTC . 
this is in this sense that the senator Murray would argumenter . 
he there has a tradition who the ask since long . 
he there has many of wisdom in that .

, the future , he the can that this be a little more difficult . 
I think that we must we show accommodants with the Department of the Finance national and this is a way of the do . 
if the committee of the fisheries examine the Estimates related to the Department of the Fisheries and of the Oceans , that your also to the ask of the senator Robichaud without that that creates of divine with this that ask the senator Murray .

the Association Parliamentary Canada - Europe 
the Organization for the security and the cooperation in Europe - - eighteenth session Annual of the Assembly Parliamentary held to St. - Petersbourg , in Russia - Inquiry 
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein , to given notice 30 November 99 : 
that he call the attention of the Senate on the report of the Association Parliamentary Canada - Europe to the eighteenth session Annual of the Assembly Parliamentary of the Organization for the security and the cooperation in Europe ( OSCE PA ) , held to St. - Petersbourg ( Russia ) of the 6 au10 July 99 . 
then that we scenes of the new millennium , can - . measurement of way equitable briefly and of way concise the policy foreign to the over of the last century ? 
what is the objective of the policy foreign ? 
he the is of do of the world a place more course and more peaceful where live . 
yet , the War has dominé the policy foreign . 
our century has began on a such note of hope . 
he there a100 years , in Horse , the tsar Nicholas II of Russia has , to from of St. - Petersbourg , launched a call to the community international for the to of a convention Honourable to limit the weapons to the level international and to create a new court international responsible of deal the differences between the States by arbitrage consensuel . 
he hoped that that apporterait the peace to the over of this new century , after the 19 century who had been dismantling by the War and who had in the death of 16 million of people . 
more later this year - that , in Horse , on the pressure of the tsar , a conference international has been convoquée to - Hague . 
in fact , this conference historic has for of establish of the line international on the weapons and of referred more particularly the bombs air , and that of establish a court international for arbitrer the differences between the States of way did . 
unfortunately , least of a year more later , in 1900 , this message of hope has been outrageously . 
the , to the over military has in . 
the construction of cuirassés , of first by the Germany and then by the England , has heavy the , to the armements Proceed . 
the outbreak of unrest in the Balkans has led to the war of the Balkans in 1912 and 1914 and has led then to the famous killing of the Arméniens . 
he there has also had then the First War World and a new expression in the lexique of the death : War World . 
in 1917 , the Quiet Russian has move . 
then that 1918 marked the end of the First War World , the War between the Russia and the Poland has move and the unrest in Ireland the are aggravés . 
a new word of hope has been added to the lexique of the death after the First War World by the chairman Woodrow Wilson : the autodétermination . 
during this time , the agitation in China the is développée , conduisant to the War civil during the years 30 and 40 . 
in URSS , in the years 30 , while that the comrades communistes and of other in the world regardaient , the épurations massives of million of people the déroulaient to of maintain the monopoly of the power of the party bolchevique . 
imitant the communism , the nazisme and the Droit étalaient their bannières much who animaient the occupation éthiopienne in Africa . 
with the assistance of the Canada , the Corporation of the Nations has adamantly and the is enlisée . 
then he there after the War of Spain and the conflict of the communism and of the Droit , conduisant to the Second War World , of first in Europe , then in Asia . 
we we bravely of the holocauste . 
he remains a something files . 
we we bravely of the horror of Nagasaki and of Nagasaki . 
in 1945 , the world seemed épuisée by the horror of the War , but he not there has not had of so in the massacres . 
in starts 40 , of the révolutions have been there in Asia of the East , in Africa and in America of the South . 
these years have seen emerging of the war without end to the East - East . 
the years 50 we have made the War of Korea and the expedite of the War of Indochine . 
the the the Speaker : 
senator Grafstein , I am sorry of you interrupt , but he is 18 p.m. . 
that wish the honourable senators ? 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
I move that His the not taking not the time . 
the the the Speaker : 
is - this of agreed , honourable senators ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the senator Grafstein : 
, the end of the years 50 , we we been witnesses of the revolution cubaine , from followed by the revolution cultural Chinese , the War of the Vietnam , the massacres to the Cambodge and the war in Angola . 
, the over of the years 60 , the Ireland the is of new enflammée , après8 decades of War . 
the years 70 have seen up to the moins37 conflict important a little across to the world . 
then are touring the years 80 with the War between the Iran and the Iraq to the over of which , in way , more of a million of people have been killed , there including of the children soldiers . 
more of people have been killed to the over of this War that in all the war who have had place to the East - East since the beginning of the century , and all that for few kilometres of Decision . 
the years 80 have been those of the War in Afghanistan , of the war tribales in Somalia , of the invasion of the begged by the Iraq who has led to the War of the begged , of the war tribales to the Rwanda , to the deflect , the long of the Congo and to the Libya and of the beginning of the War civil in Indonesia , to the Timor oriental and that in America of the South and in America core . 
honourable senators , this attainable list of war is far of be exhaustive . 
however , he there has of the hope : the infested Soviet the is désintégré . 
then the beautiful years 90 , the last decade is arrived , to the the of the further of the " ripe " . 
the collapse of the Yugoslavia , in by the separation created by the Western of the Croatia , has led to the war which we we been witnesses in Serbie , in Bosnia and finally to the Kosovo , and with all that to the impuissance of the Nations Nations . 
, the that of the new millennium , . aptly that he there has still more of 24 war who are " to the world , particularly in Africa , but also in Eurasia . 
in " in back , not seems he not that a good part of our lives to the over of the century who the work has been ponctuée of brief intermèdes between the war ? 
where were - we before the War ? 
that we - we fact between the war ? 
that we - we fact to the over of the War of the Vietnam and and of the ? 
our literature littéraires are refreshed of actions and of reactions to the various war . 
why then should - we out the work of the OSCE and of other agencies dedicated to the democracy by of the ways harshness , when we not can we prevent of look in back on this century dismantling by the death , all that to the behalf of the state or of the faith ? 
in 1994 , Zbigniew Brezinski , former - counsel of the Speaker Carter in the of democracy , has seemed that he there had had 164 million of innocence victims and of soldiers dead to the over of this century . 
I I me - same s that these violent affronts could have caused close of 200 million of dead to the over of the present century only . 
each decade has been witness of a Proceed to the chapter of the violence technologique , of the tueries insensées , of the mutilations and of the destructions gratuites . 
in this case , honourable senators , that must - we do ? 
that can - we do ? 
the condition human has she progressé to the over of this century ? 
Tolstoï has yet fact of the remarks préliminaires . 
he has wrote that we can simply hope aménager of small clairières in a dense forest . 
this is this that we we tried to the OSCE since the agreed of Helsinki he there has a Hamani of years . 
this agreed has replaced the uniqueness sanctity of the sovereignty of the state by the uniqueness sanctity of the individual . 
in a speech simply remarkable that he has persistent recently , the Secretary General of the Nations Nations , Kofi Annan , has recognized the about of the UN and of his States members who have adopted of the resolutions to to preserve of the areas seemingly , as the UN the had fact in 1995 to Srebrenica , of so that by the the the community international had passivement been witness of the killing serbe of more of 7 $ victims innocence who , graduated the words of the community international , the were advanced under the flag Blue and white of the Nations Nations only for be massacrées under the i of the caméras of television . 
recently , we we examined the resolutions of the UN regarding the Timor oriental and préconisant strongly the independence , then we we seen the UN look immobile the killing of the third of the people who believer that the UN would from the respect of his resolutions . 
the resolutions of the Nations Nations have - they took the ground of slaughter of the Timor oriental where more of 200 $ people of this territory appauvri have been killed by the Oath of the state of the Indonesia ? 
the s is the more a compliment . 
the action of the NATO to the Kosovo has guest the Russia to the follow in Tchétchénie . 
the history fact shame . 
the number of the dead is past of five million to the Eighteenth century to 16 million to the 19 century , then to to the least 200 million to the 20 century . 
the late Cecil Augustus Wright , dean of the Faculty of right that I I fréquentée , has citéM. the Justice Felix Frankfurter to the opening of the Faculty of right of the University of Toronto in 1967 . 
is this that he has said : 
also fragile that is the reason and also limited that is the right in as that expression of the médium institutionnalisé of the reason , this is all this who we harsh of the tyranny of the simple will and of the Trapping of a spirit débridé and indiscipliné . 
yet , we we learned that the principle of the over of the right not worth nothing the he not is not étayé by the power . 
this is that the unfortunate paradox of the 20 century . 
honourable senators , not should - we not wish for the next millennium that the over of the right complying the uniqueness sanctity of the life become the standard rather that the exception , and that she be formulate by the will and the power of the political ? 
yet the optimism not rime to nothing when the States - United , first super - Oath and Leader world of the democracy , say of sign a agreed international allowing to a court international of continue of the criminals of War , or a agreed of control of the armements by , or same a treaty property the Sudan nuclear . 
this was of bad bodes for the peace World in the years 90 . 
we must we ressaisir and hope that , for the next millennium , we properly in legislation of we invent a century better that the which we we inherited and that we we effect . 
honourable senators , Wiesel Wiesel who , before that that not earner the favour popular , has " the flame of the remember in this century barbare , has recently released And the Sea is Never Full , the second volume of his you . 
he we remind that , in the Genèse , when ; has fui the Land after have mordu in the result defended , the Senators of God the Jean hear : " ; , where role - you ? " 
if indeed God is across and that he is omniscient , why would - he sought to know where the people ; ? 
. we assure that God knew where the people ; . 
god wanted that ; him say him - same where he the people and this that he had fact . 
where we situons - we we - same in the history ? 
that we - we fact of our life ? 
each of we can there answer to his manner . 
we must back in question the work work by each of the organizations succeeds for the regulation peaceful of the differences . 
I can hope that the response who we will given to the century next will more interesting that the of the present century . 
can the next generation we surpasser . 
the short determined for this century - this not is personally not very high . 
there has he a truth more his which we not we not the in the of policy foreign ? 
in these two Statutory ahead can - be a solution to the énigme of the barbarie enfouie to the heart of the condition human . 
the professor Pagels fact the light on the origins of the démonisation of the " other " of first exercée by a faith , imitée then by the state séculier . 
we not do that begin to canvassing the causes of the difficulty who lives in the heart of the men and of the women . 
the difficulty is - he gravé more profoundly and of manner indélébile in the spirit of those who hold the power and who two yet silent , inertes or , worse , indifferent to the actions of barbarie made against of other under their own " ? 
is - this that the strange moral of the last millennium - see without act - and the hope for the next millennium - of the words assorties to the actions ? 
not there has he not a paradox surréaliste in this that I advocating ? 
I soutiens that the War sème the death and yet , I advocating that the . the still the War for maintain the peace , this who me brings to the aspect énigmatique of my own findings for the 20 century . 
Sunday last , the writer American Joseph Heller , author of Catch 22 , is who . 
of after a criticism : 
honourable senators , I me deregulation of quote here a short a of the novel Catch 22 : 
" you want say that he there has a attrape ? " 
" well course that he there has a attrape " , réponditDoc. 
" . not in fate not . 
all those who want avoid the service borne not are not really cacophony . " 
he not there had that a attrape and this was that . weakening of any way , to from of the time where the preoccupied of his security in opposite of dangers real and immédiats is the fact of a spirit rationnel . 
Orr could stay to land because that he was issue . 
he him Corel of the ask ; but , as that he the asked , he cessait of be issue and was accomplish of other missions . 
Orr would been issue of accomplish of other missions and statement of not not the do , but the he was widest of spirit , he was the do . 
the he the was , he was issue and not had not to the do ; but the he not wanted not the do , he was widest of spirit and he was the do . 
Yossarian was completely bouleversé by the so simplicity of this impasse and been a sifflement admiratif . 
" this is any a impasse " , observa he . 
" the more nice " , acquiesçaDoc. 
honourable senators , this is this that I then say of better in this end of century and of millennium remarkable . 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
if no other senator not wishes take the speak , I unless the debate on this inquiry debated . 
the Ontario 
the hon. Marie - P Poulin , to given notice Thursday 9 December 99 : 
that she call the attention of the Senate on the decision of the government of the Ontario of not not adopt a recommendation to to do of Ottawa a city bilingual after his restructuring proposed . 
the Thursday 9 December , I I tabled a notice of inquiry . 
why the government of the Ontario has he chosen of not not follow the recommendation of the aviseur , Mr. Glen Shortliffe ? 
what message does . to the Canadians of our country ? 
what respect demonstrates . for the Constitution of the Canada ? 
what recognition would . to the reality of the minorities linguistic of the Ontario , of the Quebec , of the provinces 32 , of the Western and of the Grand North ? 
what respect indications - . for Ottawa , seat of the Parliament Canadian , of the service public federal , of the celebrating of the world world ? 
honourable senators , several of between we pocket speak on the many questions raised by my inquiry , between other the senator Jean - Robert Gauthier . 
honourable senators , écoutons the senator Gauthier . 
Ses40 years of commitment to the principle basic of the respect of the history of our country and of the uniqueness because of our two crops fondatrices we will very useful in this inquiry . 
between - time , I has my comments of further for my speech who will end to this inquiry , more later . 
the hon. Jean - Robert Gauthier : 
honourable senators , I like of first of first thank the senator Poulin of his kindness and of his good words . 
this is a about enough thorny and , for be well frank , frustration . 
in as that human born to Ottawa , which to Ottawa and there to lived any his life , I find this debate difficult . 
the 6 December last , the government of the Ontario has presented a bill of bill regarding the merger of municipalities in Ottawa - Carleton and of other regions in Ontario , for in do of the cities unique . 
the legislation regarding the region of Ottawa - Carleton based in great part on the report Mr. Glen Shortliffe , expert - board who had been appointed by the province for study the reform local . 
the report , the public the 26 November 99 , contained of many recommendations regarding the new quoted . 
a of these recommendations proposed that the new quoted of Ottawa , amalgamée , be institutionnellement bilingual . 
however the province , in the bill of bill , not has not chosen this recommendation by of the capital of the country a city formally bilingual . 
the legislation said that : " a time the quoted hosted , she will the power of decide of his own political linguistic " . 
in the report on the restructuring , Mr. Shortliffe recommends that the quoted of Ottawa , this is the new behalf official , be bilingual . 
in the preface of the report , he said that the region is a " organizes unique " of francophones and of English in this region . 
he only his recommendation in writing : 
a of the questions the more important raised during the consultation public was the question of the bilingualism hospitals . 
more of 15 per of the new wrote of Ottawa will French . 
Ottawa is a city unique in this province and in this country because she is the capital of the Canada . 
our nation has two languages official , . the knows . 
the government national works according the Act on the languages official ; the English and the French . 
the capital national must the the uniqueness of all the country and must recognize the presence in his people of a important minority French . 
in consequential , I quote encoreM. Shortliffe in the report : 
I recommends that the bill enabling which and reclassification the wrote of Ottawa formally bilingual , in French and in English . 
I must note Mr. Shortliffe has , of way explicit , recommended that the new quoted be pantheon bilingual by the Parliament of the Ontario and not not by the new board of the pay of Ottawa . 
of more , Mr. Shortliffe has noted that he will of the resort of the senior board of the quoted of Ottawa of determine the scope and the nature of the services who will available in the two languages official of the country . 
he is true that , in the Constitution Canadian , the regulatory of the governments municipal is fully of juridiction provincial . 
in the case of the region of Ottawa - Hull , he there has a other level of authority established by the government federal who the Order the Board of the capital national , this is - to - say the region of the capital national . 
the bill créa the Board of the capital national , who succédait to the Board of the District federal . 
the authority of create the region of the capital national has been established by the power constitutional résiduel , be " Statutes for the peace , the order and the good government of the Canada " . 
he there has several options available allowing of correct this decision of the province of the Ontario regarding the bilingualism in the capital federal . 
the courts will the in serve for clarify this question . 
I not am not lawyer , but I am sure that he there will of the difficulties . 
the Parliaments provincial have the authority of adopt of the laws regarding the municipalities . 
the government of the Ontario was free of accept or of reject the recommendation Mr. Shortliffe . 
all of same , the recent decision of the courts of the Ontario regarding the Health Monfort could serve of argument in the any . 
you know all that ladite decision of the Court divisionnaire has been scope in call and I hope that . réussira to obtain justice a day in this who respect the services of health in Ontario . 
the 29 November 99 , the Court divisionnaire of the Ontario , in a judgment unanimous , has rejected the hardships of the Board on the restructuring of the services of health , who had ordered the closure of the Health sought as Hospital General for in do a bigger donor . 
the court has said that the Health sought was necessary to the legislation of the community French in the province of the Ontario . 
the court has said that the commission not was not free of ignore the role constitutional that role the Health sought as centre really French necessary to the promotion and to the development of the identity franco - Ontario . 
the minority French of the Ontario is a entity cultural and linguistic and she has need of his institutions who guarding his culture and his language against the assimilation . 
the judges have should that the government of the Ontario the must of respect the principle of the protection of the minorities in all his actions . 
they were of agreed for say that the francophones have a right constitutional the perpetuate against the assimilation , because they are part of a community cultural to the Canada and are the a of the two groups linguistic which the rights are enchâssés in the Constitution . 
the court stated , and I quote : 
... ... ... the given that the principle of the protection of the minorities - including the protection of the minority French - is a principle independent who under - parliament the Constitution and who has a effect contraignant on the governments , the court must speak , when he there has place , for ensure a protection against the measures government who will to the any of this principle . 
some consider the decision made in the case of the Health sought as a example unacceptable of militantisme judicial . 
the National Financial has public to this about . 
if you are these , will - there , but not you choquez not . 
by against , of other feel that she offer can - be a weapon puissante for the protection of the rights of the minorities . 
the decision the s widely of the two judgments that the Court Supreme of the Canada has people recently the a , in the case of the Renvoi on the Darrel of the Quebec and the other in the case Beaulac , judgments in which she has used the right of a man of the British - British to a trial bilingual . 
we apprenions yesterday that the Board of restructuring of the services of health asked the Authorized of interjeter call of the decision made by the Court divisionnaire to the about of the Health sought . 
the government has said that he support without contingency this call . 
same if a action in justice not succeeds not to to the government of the Ontario to finding the new city of Ottawa as formally bilingual , she could serve to of the for of policy public . 
she would certainly for effect of better do know the question . 
if she was delay the consolidation of the municipalities regional , of the pressure the exerceraient on the government provincial ; by against , she risk of to the Opposition and the unwelcome of those who held to deal a time for all the question of the consolidation . 
the Senate has for subject of represent the regions of the country and particularly of protect the minorities . 
a motion could be tabled to the Senate Requesting to the government of the Ontario of finding the new city of Ottawa as formally bilingual . 
, this regard , he is to note that the Assembly national of the Quebec has adopted a motion similar . 
the Parliament federal can not not would the get of a case clear provincial ; by against , the government of the Ontario not am not to the get of the Affairs federal in the tax . 
he we fact of the recommendations quasiment to all the days for cut the taxes . 
if this not is not of the meddling provincial , I not know not this that this is . 
addition that he there has a minority French appréciable in the region of Ottawa , the courts recognize of more in more the protection of the minorities as a principle under - purports of the Constitution , a principle who has a value constitutional . 
the recent judgment regarding the Health sought was on the question of know if the education French was be replaced by a institution bilingual . 
the bill of consolidation of the city of Ottawa , by against , not respect that the question of the bilingualism . 
however , he is significant that some of the municipalities who will regroupées , including , Vanier , Gloucester and Cumberland , have a people French appréciable and that a long tradition of bilingualism official . 
the lack of protection of these communities in the new city raises of the questions similar to those that raised the case of the Health sought . 
. could always let the new city of Ottawa decide if she wish be said formally bilingual . 
she could choose of not not the do or to more later on his decision . 
for more of safety , he at better that the bill provincial enabling with of the question . 
the question of the bilingualism can be very cause , as in the case of the case David Levine and the of the Health sought . 
he would more responsible of the share of the government of the Ontario of do evidence of leadership in décidant of finding as the departure the city regroupée as formally bilingual . 
the report Mr. Shortliffe is carefully prepared and affordably . 
as he the unless , the uniqueness French and English of the region fact part of his organizes unique . 
the government of the Ontario should to in implement this important recommendation . 
in the decision that she has made in the case Monro , in 1966 , the Court Supreme of the Canada establishes clear the power of the government federal on the region of the capital national . 
this is that someone something who should or who already topic Ottawa of his about and of the other regions of the Ontario . 
the Court Superior of the Ontario has of more reminded the four principles who under - tend our Constitution : the democracy , the federalism , the constitutionnalisme and the protection of the minorities , particularly the minority French . 
these principles have been through by the Court Supreme of the Canada in the causes Lisa lines , the Renvoi of the Darrel of the Quebec and the case Beaulac . 
the Position of the government in Ontario seems would let to the city of Ottawa his along of city formally bilingual . 
he is possible that this procedure result of two reasons : the refusal of the government provincial of be perceived as good - French and , second , the desire of not not open the the to the bilingualism official of the Ontario , such that described in the Constitution of the country to the clause 133 . 
in conclusion , honourable senators , I underscored for say that the city of Ottawa is unique . 
she is the capital national of a country formally bilingual . 
if she must stay the capital national , I say well if , and continue of fact of the benefits linked to this status , she should be formally bilingual . 
in more of the role of capital national , the city of Ottawa is stretch to the border of the Quebec and of the Ontario . 
she has a history and a culture francophones off and the a minority French appréciable . 
, a time of tension growing regarding the Confederation and the Darrel of the Quebec , the question of the nature bilingual of the capital national is a importance poised . 
addition that he there has a minority French appréciable in the region of Ottawa , the courts recognize of more in more the protection of the minorities as a principle under - purports of the Constitution and a value constitutional . 
the Globe and Mail not has not been also generous to the question of the Health Monfort . 
the future is to those who working . 
this is the " of the newspaper - Droit , our daily French in Ontario . 
this is this that we will . 
the hon. Serge Joyal : 
addition that she abolit of a relates of pen the result of several years of fight and that and , she fragilise to new the community minority franco - Ontario , she dimensions of furthering the conception fundamental , the ideal that we we are fact of this country where , in his capital national , his two major communities linguistic fondatrices can live in the harmony , the expand and the enrich to the touch the a of the other . 
the governments precedents of the honourable John Robarts , Bill Davis , David Peterson and can Rae not would not been also unfeeling . 
the government Harris not the in is not the the , but he attack the idea Canadian in his grounds same . 
he there has in this may a dénégation of our aspirations , a ignorance troubling of the efforts of those and those who we have predecessors , and a so of overcoming on the prejudice and the indifference who , believed - we , had 3.6 home the leaders who we gouvernent . 
Ottawa not is not a city as the other . 
this is the key sat of the capital of the Canada . 
the government and the Parliament of the Canada opèrent in the two languages official of the country . 
the Constitution Canadian there pourvoit and the Court Supreme of the Canada the has eloquently demonstrated in the v. of the 20 August 1998 on the Darrel of the Quebec . 
this v. is basic for understand the principles who we law and who are to the basic of our life democratic . 
these principles , memories - the , are to the number of four : the federalism , the democracy , the constitutionnalisme and the rule of right , and finally , and not the less , the protection of the rights of the minorities . 
this is on this last principle , " the protection of the rights of the minorities " , that I like draw your attention . 
honourable senators , I am of notice that the decision of the government summer of abolish the laws pensioners of the city of Ottawa and of Vanier , who their knew the status of city " bilingual " for the replace by a other bill where this protection is disparue , is , to my notice , anticonstitutionnelle and contrary to the principle basic of protection of the rights of the minorities linguistic recognized by the Court Supreme of the Canada in the v. of the 20 August 1998 . 
how can - we stay passive before the man9uvre who is to abolish the status bilingual of two cities , Ottawa and Vanier , for the result in a great all fusionné , ignorant systematically the impact that a such initiative will on the rights of the community minority of language official ? 
understand well the precedent ; he enough of proceed by the mechanism of the major deal for do ignored of 132 years of fight . 
. the has seen recently in the example of the Health sought . 
he has one of would the fusionner with three other hospitals of the region of Ottawa - Carleton for the do people of a relates of pen . 
the Court Superior of the Ontario has recently , the 29 November last , in a judgment unanimous of three judges , cassé this decision to the ground that she was unconstitutional , because that contrary to the protection of the rights of the minority franco - Ontario . 
let - me of remind the elements essential of the judgment of the Court of the Ontario in this case . 
the court has of first recognized that the Health Monfort jouait a role who Ghana widely the region of Ottawa - Carleton for the expand to the province full . 
she has of more underlined that the community franco - Ontario was struggle constantly against the forces of assimilation for power survive . 
the court has added , and I quote : 
this addressed found to the page 6 of the judgment . 
for survive , these communities linguistic must power the support on a system of institutions who supportent their development and limit the forces of assimilation . 
I quote : 
the uniqueness French of their institutions is therefore became of more in more important for duties the role who is to preserve and to protect this culture . 
this a is nothing of the page 7 of the judgment . 
and , these institutions must ceased in a range of jurisdictional of activities Social also broader that possible for allow to the community minority of the expand and of maintain his vitality . 
the institutions are also of the symbols important for the community franco - Ontario . 
they reflect the identity of group , the presence French in Ontario and to the Canada , the reality French in the life public and the force and the vitality of the community . 
this addressed the find to the page 7 of the judgment . 
the court has recognized the importance of the language French for support the life of the community . 
the language French is the part cultural basic of the community franco - Ontario . 
. find that to the page 8 of the judgment . 
honourable senators , all these makes not the apply - they not when he the is of the new city of Ottawa , where the francophones are more of 125 $ citizens and are more of 15 per of the people overall ? 
the city of Ottawa not is - she not , for the more great share , the sat land of the Board of the capital national , she - same body bilingual ? 
how the francophones of the country , who séjournent in the capital for there represent their region , réagissent - they opposite to the indifference of the government summer to the regard of the symbol same of the life national ? 
of the mayors of Ottawa the had déja including . 
why cancel of the years of harmony linguistic for forward to new the francophones to return on the barricade of the claims ? 
why significant to new the reinforcing political when the peace linguistic had succeeded to the establish in the respect linked ? 
not , the decision of the government summer is contrary to the spirit of our Constitution . 
she impropriety the commitment of respect of the equality between the two communities , who is the touchstone same of the proclaim Canadian . 
the Court Superior of the Ontario the has well reminded : the principle of protection of the rights of the minorities , and I quote : 
... not are not that " describe " of the rights . 
they infusent the life in our Constitution . 
well that this be of the principles under - revealed and not writing of the Constitution , they could however do emerging of the rights legal internal who limiteraient California the action of the government ; in addition , these principles are " also investment of a force normative puissante and tie to the time the courts and the governments " . 
, this regard , the court citait the Renvoi relatif to the Darrel of the Quebec ... 1998 , 2 R . C . S . 217 ... , pages 248 and 249 of the notice of the court . 
the Canada , has said the Court Supreme , is a democracy constitutional . 
said simply , the principle of the constitutionnalisme demands that any action of the government respect the Constitution . 
. find that to the page 8 of the judgment . 
the initiative legislative of the government summer , who abolit the status of city bilingual for the new city of Ottawa ... 
... must be measured to the aune of the " protection of the minorities " , the a of the principles structurants basic of the Constitution . 
if the conduct is wrong and impropriety this principle , the court of review must speak ... 
that the find to the page 20 of the judgment . 
honourable senators , he we must from the findings who the do . 
seen that the principle of the protection of the minorities - and particularly of the minorities francophones - is a principle independent and under - purports of the Constitution , a principle fresher of a force normative puissante who locks the government , the court must speak to the need for protect lesdites minorities against any intervention of the government who will to the any of this principle . 
this addressed the find to the page 23 of the judgment . 
the citizens francophones of the city of Ottawa and of Vanier , and , to a other degree , those of the cities of Cumberland and of Gloucester will their right of receive of the new city of the services in French . 
he in does of same for the other Canadians who séjournent to Ottawa for there represent their commettants , their region or their District Senate , as this is the case for me - same . 
he we must therefore mean to the government summer that the he refuses of reconsidered the legislation who abolit for the new city of Ottawa the status of city bilingual , a any will business before the courts beneficial competent for do declare nulles and not anticipating the provisions of the bill of bill who aboliraient the recognition of the French in the statuts of the new city . 
honourable senators , he there has a inequity his to withdraw a right by the of a initiative of merger who is to noyer in a great all a community who disposait before of right sufficient . 
he would really too simple of proceed and for significant the principles who are to the basic of our order constitutional . 
this is that the ideal same who is to the basic of the identity and of the over of our country . 
this ideal not is not reached , and he must always there work , he not there has not of repos for those who the used . 
we not can allow that of the politicians provincial , to short view , internationalist of vision national , attack and our ideal without that we réagissions with the ways that the bill fundamental of our country we guarantees . 
not let not this may become the symbol of the defeat of our community , out of tailler his place in the capital of our country . 
honourable senators , this is my firm intention of me Engage to this that a action in disability be business against the bill Ontario who refuserait of recognize the rights learning of the minority French of Ottawa and of all the citizens of this country who believe profoundly in the equality of status of the two languages official . 
Prouvons that a time that a government has recognized a benefit of status to our community , he not can more act of manner time , and create to new the inequality . 
he there has 23 years , I entamais of the the against the Minister of the Transport of the time of my own government , for do declare none a regulation prevented the use of the French in the cabines of pilotage ; he there has 23 years , I entamais also a any against Air Canada , society of the Crown , for the to to the determining of tools for do of the French a language of work in aviation . 
the two actions have been welcomed Right by the courts Canadian . 
he there has 17 years , to as of Secretary of state of the Canada , I contribuais to to on at the program of challenge judicial for help the communities minority of languages official to do respect their rights . 
still today today , he will do call to this program for support our determination to in ensure the survival and the rayonnement . 
the government summer has decided of to the judgment of the Health Monfort in call . 
he has thought timely of in one the legitimacy . 
let the fight , if necessary , until in Court Supreme of the Canada , that where our rights must receive their last recognition . 
I urge therefore the senators Marie - P . 
Poulin , Jean - Robert Gauthier and that the citizens of Ottawa and of all the Canada to approach to the courts for protect their rights and those of all those who believe in a country where the equality of the French and of the English is a ideal of civilization and of freedom unique for the dignity human . 
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , I would few questions to question to the senator Joyal . 
the the the Speaker : 
since the time " to the senator Joyal is expired , let - you to the hon. senator of continue to question of the questions ? 
of the Senators : 
of agreed . 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , he starts to be later and some of between we have of the obligations . 
the senator Grafstein : 
honourable senators , I has the observation of the Leader of the Opposition to the spirit and I be short . 
the question is important . 
we we heard three senators francophones speak of this about . 
I I a observation and a question to present to the hon. senator . 
personally , I find incompréhensible that the policy bipartite of the government of the Ontario not that not been of go of the before of way energetic . 
the first ministers Robarts and Davis , of the Party Conservative , the Prime Minister Peterson , of the Party Liberal , and that the Prime Minister Rae , of the NDP , would certainly irrités - and I hope that we the opens give their notice - before this diversion and these gamineries of the government of the Ontario . 
I say that to as of senator of the region of Toronto . 
if the hon. senator will of the before with the point before the courts , I be happy of do furthering common with him to as of senator representative Toronto . 
he is important that of the senators not francophones do of of their dissatisfaction before the political adopted in the region that they are . 
the first extract to expand the zone geographical of the Board of the capital national , this who , I poured , could the do by a bill of bill of initiative Parliamentary presented to the Senate . 
by therefore , he is clear that all the territory of the capital national is bilingual . 
second , has he arisen the point to the power of awesome of the bill provincial which has the government federal ? 
the senator Joyal : 
honourable senators , the question that the senator Grafstein raises is a question who , in right , is complex . 
the Board of the capital national not has not the jurisdiction him allowing of provide of the services municipal in of the areas as those of the fire , of police , of the facilities of pursuits , and cetera . 
according the Board of the capital national , the provisions of presents urban understand of other responsibilities , particularly in report with the presence of the government federal . 
I about here of the services of Administration and other who , until to a sure point , recoupent those of the Administration municipale . 
same if we we expand the line of the Board of the capital national for that they regroupent the together of the territory he by the new city , the line of the new city of Ottawa would regulated by the bill as this is the case of the city current . 
in this who respect the power of repeal , the honourable senators understand that this is a question very complex . 
the Court Supreme of the Canada has administering that a power not can be squelched as and also long that he found in the Constitution . 
however , this is that a question on which should the look the government of the Canada if a recommendation was made to the gouverneure General of the Canada in this context and in they the that this power not has not been used since very long . 
the he had been used , this would in of the circumstances exceptional . 
this could be that a raccourci for all to the solution that we wish , but he there of other ways who could be all also effective . 
he would useful for all the Canadians of all the provinces that a decision be taken in this matter . 
I see the senator Lynch - Lynch of the other side of the House . 
he knows that North Hatley and Ayer' s Cliff are in are of fusionner in the same context . 
however , if these cities fusionnent , North Hatley perdra the status of city bilingual that him recognizes the ( 13 f ) of the Act on the language French to the Quebec . 
they want fusionner the services . 
someone 40 per of the people of the new city would of language English , this who the translate by the loss of their status bilingual . 
this question is a such importance that he is impossible of him to a solution by the through of a power of repeal . 
he is very important in this country that the rights individual of the minority , that she be of language English or of language French , be guaranteed . 
in of other words , a time that these rights have been recognized , they not can be indirectly down by of the objectives administrative who are shaped on the plan financial but who equivalent to a destruction total of these same rights for the minority . 
( on the motion of the senator Fraser , the debate is adjourned . ) 
the Senate 
motion of keeping of the procedure of Assent Royal - Maintien of the motion 
, the call of the motion No. 43 : 
that the Senate of the Canada states the procedure of Assent Royal to the Senate , such that she is opinion by the authorities in procedure Parliamentary Norman Wilding and Philip Laundy : " - ceremony pratiquée to the Canada is the who seems the apparenter the more to the distinct " . 
that the Senate ' the right sovereign of Majesty Majesty , such that he is statement in the Act constitutional of 1867 , and who him authority the prerogative of deal the procedures parliamentarians and the bills of bill studied , the to the Senators or adopted in the two Houses of the Parliament ; 
that the Senate , in as that House where Majesty Majesty authority the Assent Royal , states the right constitutional ancestral as House of the Parliament where convergent the business of the three branches of the Parliament Futures together in as that Parliament of the Canada ; 
that the Senate states the right of the Parliament , the " lex parliamenti " , the bill ancestrale who has that the consent Alaska is required for the study by the Parliament of all bill of bill or any procedure Parliamentary who would the prerogative of Majesty Majesty ; 
that the Senate states that the procedure Parliamentary to follow by a member for obtain the consent Alaska is of table to this effect a motion to question to Majesty Majesty , who the topic of the other forms of request of consent Alaska which have access the Prime Minister or the ministers in the year of their responsibilities business ; 
that the Senate states the obligation of obtain the consent of Majesty Majesty before that be examined a bill of bill who affectera the prerogative Royal , to the example of the consent Alaska who has been given by the Queen Elizabeth II to the Royal Assent Bill of 1967 , who has been the to the House of the Lords of the Kingdom - Kingdom by the Grand Chancellor Gardiner to the step of the second Reading of the bill of bill , the 2 March 1967 : 
" your Seigneuries , I am responsible by Majesty Majesty the Queen of inform the House that Majesty Majesty , to been mentioned of the subject of the bill of bill , hear to to his prerogative and the interest , in the legislation where they are RCMP by the bill of bill , to the clause of the Parliament to the for of the bill of bill . " 
and who has been given few weeks more later , the 17 April 1967 , to the House of the Commons of the Kingdom - Kingdom by the prosecutor General Sir Elwyn Jones : 
" I am responsible by the Queen of inform the House that Majesty Majesty , to been mentioned of the subject of the bill of bill , hear to to his prerogative and the interest , in the legislation where they are RCMP by the bill of bill , to the clause of the Parliament to the for of the bill of bill . 
I I the honour of propose that the bill of bill be now read a second time . " 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I point the Rules . 
same if the sponsor of this motion , the senator Cools , not is not present , if I not raises not this question now , I could be accused of not not the have raised as that I I could the do . 
I move therefore that the rule of the anticipation be namely in the case present . 
indeed , if this motion is on to the Paper , the same question there figurera a second time . 
the first between in conflict with the second . 
as the for the comment 512 ( 1 ) of the sixth edition of the Beauchesne : 
( 1 ) - shut of studying , in of other words the shut of to more earlier that provided a case on to the Paper , result of the same principle that the rule who , of raise two time the same question to the over of a session . 
I draw also your attention on the comment 512 ( 2 ) . 
I point the Rules because that I believe that the Bill bill S - 7 is a form of procedure more effective that the motion of the senator Cools . 
by therefore , the bill of bill S - 7 should have above , and the motion of the senator not should not included to the Paper . 
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the senator Cools not is not here currently . 
I ask therefore to the honourable senators of have the indulgence of to the least him give the opportunity of the deal on the point to the Rules of the senator Lynch - Lynch . 
I move therefore of repeating the discussion on the point to the Rules tomorrow , in presence of the hon. senator . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , we not are before of no motion now . 
a notice of motion has been given by the hon. senator Cools . 
by therefore , he not there has nothing on what I can to a decision . 
I understand however the point of view that has fact point the hon. senator Lynch - Lynch . 
I I examined the situation , but I not can nothing do as that we not properly not before of the motion . 
the time come , I be happy of reflect to the question regarding the Rules .

the Russes were also represented by of great protocol of this series of hockey of 1972 : 
this team has she fact Appendix ? 
without no doubt , say - I , particularly if by " Appendix " you want speak of the way of to the volume and the perspective with some tons allowing these effects of light who taxation the contours . 
some senators say that I about more of a picture of Monet or of Cézanne . 
this not is not true . 
this team rest in the memory of the Russes a model of behaviour , of spirit of team , of determination and of spirit sportsman . 
I was proud of do part of all that . 
the Russes not knew that do for we do happy .

the place was if great that . had the sentiment that . could inevitable our buildings of the Parliament in a Room , and he there had three wards of this size . 
this is really intimidant when the chairman Eltsine has a meeting in a of these wards and that . not it that a office and two chaises and that . much all the other day .

the the the Speaker : 
of the Senators : 
the appointment of the Lieutenant - Governor Statutes Hole 
the hon. Joyce Fairbairn : 
honourable senators , I am outset that the other honourable senators of the Alberta the join to me for draw the attention of the Senate on the change spoken to the position of Lieutenant - Governor in our province of origin . 
laws is a woman of Affairs , a auteure , a diffuseure , a activist in the area of the education who has he on a period of 30 years various positions to the within of the advice of the districts school of St. - Penitentiary and of the about . 
she has generously and advisory supported of the activities to the within of his community and of the city of Edmonton , where she is very admirée for his skills and the excellent sense of the humour . 
of the people from of across in America of the North looking the notice of Statutes and , to the over of the five last years , she has taken the speak before someone higher groups and businesses . 
he there has a year and half , she has received the Order of the Canada and has been made Chancellor of the University of the Alberta . 
already , she the shows from to the perspective of the duties of his new responsibilities the given that she for to the focus on the importance of the education and of the learning for the citizens of all the unwelcome . 
I him wish many of success and I the support in any the legislation of my ways . 
honourable senators , Statutes unseemly to a wonderful gentleman , Olson Olson , a farmer of cardiology Hat who , during more of four decades , has spent his life to the public . 
he has been member to the House of the Commons during 15 years and senator of gravity until to the recount to the position of Lieutenant - Governor in 1996 . 
all to the long of his career , Olson has been recognized as a of the débatteurs and experts of the procedure the more qualified of the time . 
he me has certainly many learned during all the years where we we been friends on the Hill of the Parliament . 
the Increase in the career of Olson Olson , this is that he has always expressed with passion and her the concerns of his province and , in particular , of the community agricultural . 
but beyond - beyond of all that , he must the remind the great patriotism concern to the regard of the country and of the because of the unity , sentiment who the has drove also in the more recent position that he has he .

Olson the is always he for the policy . 
he has always been a excellent orator very very in logical .

not very long after , he accédait to the position of Minister to the within of the cabinet Liberal and the baladait in limousine . 
this is for you say that the people of the south of the Alberta will always very quickly in case . 
I see that the senator Ghitter is of agreed with me . 
I know Statutes Hole since more long that she not would the in remember . 
, the time , as the most of the Liberal , I I should leave Calgary for me do elected . 
today today , when we employons the expression " without - homeless " , this is for finding a Liberal to Calgary . 
after have served together during of many years in the sector of the education , I thought have reached a purpose . 
a of my friends Abitibi of the protocol of football home the graduates of the school in Alberta for the do play in Oklahoma . 
I the I him home the Hole , which the two son were of solid gaillards . 
the family full is sports , but Statutes me has supported in of the words without answer that , well that his son have been in legislation of take their own decisions , in as that parents , she and the husband souhaitaient that these young people play to the football to the Canada and not , . 
I the attention for show that Statutes was guarantee the matriarche of the clan .

Lynda the is as actively of policy during good number of years . 
she was Leader of the Party Liberal of the Saskatchewan to little close to the same time where I occupais this position to the Manitoba .

question PERIOD PERIOD 
the Finance 
the line of the mandate of the members of the Board of Investment of the Plan of Pension of the Canada 
the hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government and the on the Plan of Pension of the Canada and the recommendations of the committee Senate Standing of the Banking and of the trade . 
, the beginning of 1988 , the committee of the Banking has undertaken a study exhaustive of the Board of Investment of the Plan of Pension of the Canada . 
I I been happy of see that the government federal and the provinces approuvaient to the least a of our recommendations , who was to limit the number of mandates that could duties a as . 
in his response of September 1998 to the report of our committee , the Minister has said that the tax of a limit discussed of the changes legislation . 
if the honourable senators the recall the debate the to the time , he was incredibly none that the bill of bill on the Board of Investment of the Plan of Pension of the Canada be adopted . 
the Minister said that the changes not could not be made because that he would amend the bill . 
now that the Minister of the Finance has answered to this part of the bill of bill and that he has said that the government fixerait a term limited for the mandate of the directors , we not let no referring to the bill of bill in the announcement of the week last . 
the officials that we we contactés not were to the aware of no plan to to present a bill of bill enclosing the measures announcements the week last . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I not I knowledge of no bill of bill to been presented by the Minister of the Finance until to now . 
he the can that he choisisse of the do more later , but I not I knowledge of other bill of bill in this time . 
as to the substance of the reaching up in 1998 , I the know . 
I then however attempt of to the question to the Minister and to with a response in time wanted . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
the Leader can - he the Engage to provide a response written expliquant why he not there has not of bill of bill and why the Minister of the Finance has said , in September 1998 , that he in would a ? 
this is important because that we we thought the Minister , and this is why number of members of the committee have designed the idea of annexer a letter to the bill of bill rather of adopt the amendment directly to the committee . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I will try of confirm to the senator if the government has the intention of present a bill of bill . 
the transport 
the restructuring of the industry of the transport Threat - - effect of the monopoly of Air Canada 
the hon. Donald H . Oliver : 
honourable senators , I I a question to question to the Leader of the government to the Senate to the about of the transportation . 
the senators know that the committee Senate of the transport has fact a excellent analysis of the decision of the Minister of the Transport of suspend the application of the clause 47 of the Act on the competition , this who has for to the society Onex of propose a important restructuring of the sector of the transport Threat . 
the committee has found that no reason not sort that the Minister suspende the application of this clause . 
I me ask , for begin , if the Leader of the government has a explanation . 
this are all of the questions important . 
the week last , I I asked of the questions to the Minister to the about of the increase of the rates of Air Canada , and . we said now that Air Canada trafique the points of the program for great travellers . 
the Leader can - he we give the insurance that the Canadians not will not broyés by the monopoly of Air Canada ? 
who canada the rights of the consumers in this restructuring ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , in this who respect the protection of the so Canadian , if a only transporteur dominait the market , we appliquerions the principles that the Minister has out and that I I repeated here to few occasions . 
in the circumstances current , the transporteur bluff will the conform to of the rules clear . 
the senator Oliver : 
if the Parliament the adjourned until in February , who will the with of the matter if the rates continue to increase and if . continues to amend the system of points ? 
who will protect the consumers to this regard ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
the agencies regulatory in place will continue to the duties of their mandate . 
of more , the commitment of the Minister of the Transport has been release to Air Canada in the words the more it . 
I I fully confidence that the consumers will protected . 
the hon. Consiglio Nino Nino : 
I me ask if the Minister could we say the he there has of the new to the about of the statement of the Minister according which the carriers foreign would given to having to the Canada , particularly in the area of the cabotage . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I not I nothing to add to this about for the time . 
I me forward to this that the Minister , under little a are of measures . 
I am course that they will ensure to the principles who have been out to several occasions to the behalf of the government . 
these principles garantissent that the consumers are protected . 
the senator Nino Nino : 
the Minister could - he obtain for we a response on the question of the cabotage of here to this that the Senate reprenne his business the year next ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I will share of the concern of the senator and I bring his ask of information . 
he will to the Minister of decide the he to deal separately and in public of a part of the measures or the he to propose a together of measures as a all . 
the Defence national 
the Alternative of the helicopters Sea King 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , the given the incidents indicated in the newspapers these the months and including the headline of the Presse Canadian of today today according which he there would had to the least 10 ou12 incidents where of the doors , of the papers plates , of the papers of rotor and of other papers would tombées of the helicopters Sea King , the government think he to the staff who must taxing in these helicopters ? 
I me ask this that the people of Halifax - Western - where the Leader of the government to the Senate want can - be the present during of the next election federal - think when the Sea King survolent their houses . 
in despite of the notes of information of the Minister of the Defence , who say that he will eight years for complements the program of Alternative of the helicopters submarines , the Minister him - same states that he can lead to well a such program in five years . 
I accept this deadline , but some conditions Visas in stake and I like have the comments of the Minister . 
I I fact many of research on the question and I I spoke to many of people who know exactly what is the situation . 
if the government is before the end of the months , . me said that he would possible of complete in 2005 . 
the government ferra he this that he must before the end of the year ? 
for - he take the measures necessary before the end of December of this year ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I I read this clause in the newspaper and I had provided that the question would raised . 
I I read carefully this clause and I in I made copy with me . 
the senator has all to fact reason of say that a series of incidents are s in the past and that we in opens certainly still speak . 
however , this series of incidents confirms that these helicopters are old and achèvent their life useful . 
I I noted that Colin Curleigh , a Brigadier General to the retirement and a man very respected in the cercles military of Halifax , was quoted in this clause . 
Mr. . Curleigh has confirmed that , to the notice , he would possible of have replaced the Sea King in 2005 . 
he not has not added that he would that the appropriation be dégagés before ë , of the least not in this clause . 
however , he has should that the Alternative could be debated in 2005 . 
I I been happy of hear a expert of the questions military as the Brigadier General Curleigh confirm the information that I I obtenue of other sources and according which the reliability of the aircraft the concern , by Opposition to the security of the people . 
he must say , in any justice to the senator , that the Brigadier - General has added that the bill could be led to well in 2005 , but that he would for that a enormous will policy . 
I i that he was probably to the aware of the fact that the Minister of the Defence national has fact of this question his first priority . 
I I good hope that he the is that of the kind of commitment necessary for do advance the program . 
the senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , he there has a other condition who will of hand with the plan of implementation in implement . 
I respect enormous the Brigadier - General Curleigh that I know , as the Minister the in doubt , since 25 or 30 years . 
I am in the parages since long . 
I I known the Brigadier - General Curleigh when he was officer subalterne . 
the question of the will policy has been occasion . 
if we want begin the process , we must do a commercially to of have a choice . 
are - we prepared to do the sacrifice of the benefits equity regional who could be necessary for achieve this objective ? 
this is a question extremely important . 
when we about of security , we about of reliability . 
a accessoire of Sudan is piece of a Sea King in full flight , to Shearwater . 
a panneau of drives is piece of a apparatus Sea King the 29 August , and the . not the in is view that to the over of a inspection after the atterrissage . 
a other Sea King has lost a panneau different to the over of a flight between Thunder Bay and Kenora . 
a balise of search the is détachée by inadvertent of a modulateur , the 24 September , to the over of a flight beyond - that of the part core of the Maine . 
he there will a War with the Americans , if we not do not attention . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the point that the senator raises regarding the iceberg example well the grow of the process . 
this is always , affiliated , a series of compromise . 
must - he responsiveness the track for have the possible of buy to the within of the Canada ? 
this are that of the questions which the Minister of the Defence national must weigh during of each acquisition of equipment military . 
I not I not the jurisdiction required for measurement the various factors to from of the data that I has , but I am am that the Minister the of such decisions couramment for not any what Purchase . 
he the would certainly in the case of a acquisition also important that the Alternative of the Sea King . 
the senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , nothing not will fact before the end of the , year , this who means that , in five years , we not will not still this equipment if seriously necessary . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I please the senator of not not from a such conclusion . 
I remains honourable . 
I me am ago with the Minister of the Defence national . 
he me has fact share of his priorities who , I the hope , the transformeront in action . 
the health 
the increase of the Estimates in research on the cancer of the within 
the hon. Marjory LeBreton : 
honourable senators , since we about of will policy , the week last , . has could read in The Ottawa Citizen that a proposal introduced to the government that that he increase to 235 million of $ the Estimates program to the research and to the treatment of the cancer of the within has been defeated , same if each knows that this is the form the more day of cancer home the woman . 
of same , in the book Red of 1997 , he is wrote clear that the cancer of the within fact part of the major problems in the of health . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate can - he we say when the government will take to heart this serious illness and act to this about ? 
the government has spent a billion of $ for deal the contract of the airport Pearson and 764 million of $ for deal the contracts after the cancellation of the given of the helicopters EH - EH he there has six years . 
the the of these Estimates , how the government can - he justify the refusal of a amount of 235 million of $ on five years for help the women afflicted of cancer of the within ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the government the very to the seriously the efforts been for fight this illness and inevitable the people who in suffering . 
I not am not really to the aware of the ask to which the senator has fact referring . 
in fact , I am a little confus as to the nature exactly of the ask , to know the he the was of the Benefit direct of services medical underfunded by the government federal or the he there had a some participation of the share of the departments provincial of the Health . 
unfortunately , I not I not these information before me and I am therefore out of give a response complete to the senator . 
the senator LeBreton : 
he has been many question of this case in the media . 
I I seen someone something to this about in The Ottawa Citizen . 
a friend to me me has said that he had read a clause on this case in the Sun of Vancouver . 
the government has rejected of the revers of the with a suggestion from of a of the members of the own caucus , who the find to be doctor and who includes certainly the serious of this illness . 
yet , the government not the is not gêné for literally 1,764 billion of $ for cancel of the contracts . 
how the government can - he justify that to the women who suffering of the cancer of the within and to their families ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I am a little disadvantaged here because that I not know not the details of the proposal . 
the was - he of business of research ? 
the was - he of the Benefit direct of services medical ? 
the senator LeBreton : 
he the was of business of research . 
the senator Boudreau : 
the he the was of the Benefit direct of services medical , in as that former Minister provincial of the Health , I not know really not how that could operate . 
the he the was of business of research , I understand . 
I attention also to the senator the new program majeur of research in health who has been announced and who is supported by the government . 
the proposal regarding the Instituts Canadian of research in health represents a initiative without precedent in our country in this who respect the research in health . 
. could think that the cancer of the within can nervousness be included in this initiative major . 
the Council of the Board 
the increase of the Prestation national for children - - devancement of the date 
the hon. Erminie J . Cohen : 
honourable senators , we apprenions in the speech of the Throne that the Prestation national for children would increase to from of 2002 . 
according of the information who have fact the subject of a identifies and who have been sent to the National Financial he there has few weeks , this legislation cost about 650,000 million of $ the first year and , a time implemented in the together , 23,850 million of $ each year by the the . 
the Prestation national for children is amounts to the families poor of the Canada . 
she their provides the assistance financial which they have desperately need for the you of the food , of the Clothing and a housing . 
same in they the of the Estimates incidental and of the factors of taken , the government the is to put a surplus of 5,5 billion of $ the year next . 
the government has he of good reasons of not not increase as the year next the Benefit amounts to the families poor of the Canada , who could then see the difference in their cheque to from of July 2000 ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the hon. senator for his question and for the support to this program . 
the government enregistrera a surplus and we we in réjouissons all . 
the deserves in up essentially to the Minister of the Finance . 
however , the way which the surplus will redistribué will evaluated in service of the various needs , who will , I poured , all very urgents and legitimate . 
I not know not if the suggestion of the hon. senator can be taken in consideration , but I ensure to the i to the people can . 
the senator Cohen : 
honourable senators , the government has succeeded to put a surplus to the backs of the poor . 
the only generates of the Prestation national for children the to the fact that a agreed concluded with the provinces their allows of settle the money and paid to the recipients social . 
the government can - he delay the Rich of this program and ensure rather to this that any the increase the be amounts not only to the workers poor , but also to all the families to low income ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I must to on the suggestion not based according which the surplus has been chosen to the backs of the poor . 
this surplus the ask in part by the vigour of the economy . 
our happened national gross knows a growth without precedent . 
that not is not a accident , but the result of political solid , sensées and modérées . 
the growth economic is extremely strong . 
in by evidence of discipline on the plan budget , we we succeeded to in come to the point where the parliamentarians can discuss of the priorities which they want answer through to this surplus . 
this is a situation wonderful . 
in this who respect the details of the question , I not repeat not my response original if this not is for say that the suggestions of the hon. senator will are to the Minister in question .

the Minister can - he we obligations to the advance for that we can prepare the statements who the imposeront to the opportunity of the replacement ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I am soulagé .

honourable senators , I thank the new chairman of our committee , the senator Lowell Murray , of his expeditiously , of the resume to the work and of the i caring . 
I thank also a veteran who has resumed of the service to the committee , the senator Doody , who has already he the position prestigious of chairman of this committee . 
that said , honourable senators , and to thanked all the members of the committee for their good work , I like now prier all the honourable senators of approve the granting of appropriation to Majesty Majesty and to the government of Majesty Majesty in would the bill of bill C - 21 to that the government of the Canada can vaquer to his Affairs . 
the hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I thank the senator Cools of his words his . 
I him so the such , but not only for the form because I the thank do of this explanation complete and detailed of this bill of bill of appropriation . 
she has greatly facility my work . 
honourable senators , let - me of explain in what context the Senate at these measures . 
well heard , in under of the Constitution , we we the right of amend , or same of reject , all bill of bill which we are before . 
however , the Senate has recognized that the granting of appropriation , the tax of taxes and the measures financial in General are part of the prerogatives the more jalousement gardées of the House of the Commons . 
the Senate évolutif of the after - War has found the way of exercise his responsibilities to as of House equal of the Parliament all in complying the prerogatives of the House of the Commons in these areas . 
by therefore , we throw before all the budget to the committee Senate Standing of the Finance national . 
the committee of the Finance national not taking not necessarily all the programs . 
he attempts of study the Estimates of the Administration public federal in a perspective of policy administrative particularly , of so that the mandate not can not be CRTC . 
the mandate must be General for the study of the appropriation and of the forecasts . 
that not from not a committee Senate ... 
generally , the Estimates of the Estimates is referred to the committee Senate Standing of the Finance national . 
the committee the examine and in makes the to the Senate . 
after what , the Senate resolution generally the bill of bill of appropriation who we so generally a little more later of the House of the Commons . 
I draw the attention of the honourable senators on our report , where several questions important are raised by the committee . 
the senator Cools has mentioned the 0,5 billion of $ that the government has required in the Estimates of the Estimates Supplementary for solve the problem of the a , year 2000 . 
we we also out the been of loans loans to of the governments foreign . 
the committee was of notice that the government would should develop a series of criteria who we would for of determine the relevance of any been of loans to the future . 
he would been well also that the . can see a link between the been of the debts of yesterday and our policy of borrowing of tomorrow , but this is that a point of view all to fact staff that I outlining . 
that the the amount required to this end during the year aware to about 132 million of $ , which 70 million of $ seem be keynotes to the new vessels of the Embassy of the Canada to Berlin . 
we like know where will the 60 other million of $ and the Department has promised of we enlighten more later on this question . 
we are impatients that he the the . 
the question of the recovery of the costs for the inquiry done by the government on the crash of the of of Swissair on the coasts of the Nova - Nova has been raised . 
the senator Ferretti Ferretti has length stressed on the fact that he was encourage the government to continue of clamour a allowance of Swissair . 
, long term , the committee is of notice that he must change the sections relevant of the Convention of cardiology to that the carriers Threat and their assureurs assume a some responsibility for the investigations and the prospect the to the accidents Threat . 
. has found that the Canada is particularly vulnérable on the plan financial because that the number of prohibit in the space Air is more high compared to the of other country . 
this question we respect to the more senior point , and the senator Ferretti Ferretti has reason of ask that the Department of the Affairs foreign the there before as that possible . 
honourable senators , the increase of the funds necessary to the program of control of the weapons to fire has certainly attention our attention to the committee , and the senator Tkachuk has issue the about during the period of the questions few days after that the committee the be met . 
a other question that we we pressing among as of other - and I attirerais your attention on all the report - is the great question of the Payments paid under the regime of the Act on the responsibility of the state . 
this is the a of the issues favoris of the senator Doody , and he the has sue very effectively , my faith , all as a sure number of other colleagues during our hearings of committee . 
the point raised by the senator Doody was that . not people no clause in the Estimates of the Estimates for the case on the equity line , that the government has many before the courts - for say the things such that they are . 
we our all , I believe , that this is a question of taken of the share of the government . 
in this case - this , he has amassé the money in the credit of the salaries and of the benefits social , where human not could course not the find . 
the senior officials we have well said that if . their had asked of the questions in the intervalle , they the would esquivées . 
if the . had known how of money the government off of side to the case where he invested his because , the Position legal , for not not say policy , of the government would course been many more precarious . 
we understand the context in which the government has tranquillement amassé of the money without would in chiffrer the amount before the day redouté where he would should pay . 
that the said , however , during a sure number of years , the government has the of side of the hundreds of million of $ , to reason of as by year , in the credit of the salaries and of the benefits social . 
no of between we not the in is view and no of between we not has asked of question to this about . 
now that the case is to his end - the government will still quelquefois on the sellette - the government moneys the money pursuant to the clause 30 of the Act on the responsibility of the state . 
the Parliament not will not the less opportunity of the deal on the question or of discuss of the amount paid , or of the way which he will paid , or of the reasons for which he is paid , or same of the policy of the government , and and of the . 
this is a question who has tracassé the best drain of the committee , be the senators Bolduc , Doody , Cools and Moore , including . 
I not should not appoint these senators , because all the members of the committee the are many these to this question . 
we we out our intention of there to also a day . 
I not know not this that that will , but I believe that the question is important . 
honourable senators , after have followed the remarks order by our colleague , the senator Cools , and if you jetez a the of i on the report , better still , if you read the report that the committee has presented on the Estimates Supplementary of the Estimates on which based this bill of bill of appropriation , you agree , I the hope , that the committee has examined very carefully this budget and that you can in any conscience approve this bill of bill . 
( the motion is agreed and the bill of bill is read a second time . ) 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall - we this bill of bill a third time ? 
the senator Cools : 
honourable senators , as we the know , a deadline of a day is required for to to the third Reading of the bill of bill , but I believe that he there has a real consensus of the two sides of the House for to as now to the third Reading . 
the the the Speaker : 
the leave is - she granted , honourable senators ? 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
not . 
the senator Murray : 
I not think not that he be possible of give our leave . 
the the the Speaker : 
the leave not is not granted . 
( on the motion of the senator Cools , the third Reading of the bill of bill is on to the order of the day of the next sitting . ) 
bill of bill of 99 for the implementation in implement of conventions tax 
third Reading - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Hervieux - Hervieux , P , seconded by the hon. senator Gauthier , Honourable to the third Reading of the bill of bill S - 3 , Act an in implement a agreed , of the conventions and of the protocoles concluded between the Canada and the Kirghizistan , the Lebanon , the Algeria , the Bulgaria , the Portugal , the Ouzbékistan , the Jordan , the Japan and the Luxembourg , in view of avoid the duplicates Socialist and of prevent the evasion tax in the of taxes on the income . 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 3 has been referred to two committees . 
I not speak not of the decision of the committee of the Banking to the regard of the bill of bill or of the study that he him has so . 
, first view , the bill of bill S - 3 is , essentially , a legislation to to avoid the double tax . 
he respect several country with which we we the intention of nothing or in which we want invest , and he is therefore in the interest linked of the Canada and of the country responsible of adopt a such legislation legislative . 
honourable senators , the bills of bill allowing of avoid the double tax not are not a reviews . 
the Parliament in receives since very long . 
as the have indicated the officials of the Agency of the income , their analysis there two consistently for ensure to this that the citizens who sleazy of the Affairs in of other country not be not mobile two time . 
the purpose of the bills of bill in the of double tax is of see to this that he not there that not of aim tax . 
the bills of bill of this type limited to the government more of leviers him allowing of ensure to this that all the taxes exigibles be surveys . 
however , I am summer that the bill of bill S - 3 that fact the subject of the kind of review which not have not been submitted of other bills of bill in the past , well that that would should be the case . 
he there has a exception dignified of says , and this is the agreed on the aim tax who has been examined to the committee of the Affairs foreign , rather that to the committee of the Banking , in May 1998 . If my memory is faithful , the agreed the was to of the country as the Croatia , the Chile and the Vietnam . 
the committee of the Affairs foreign has underlined that the . not was not only the preoccupied of tax and that the . was to the legislation legislative in they the of all the aspects of the policy foreign . 
as the know the honourable senators , after have began to deal with a country , he so in of many case that we in proficiently to accept their structures , their values and their attitudes . 
, the time of the review by the committee , the senator Nino Nino and of other members of the committee , which the senator Grafstein , if I me remind well , have expressed the notice that we should have the insurance that the country with which we covenant of the agreements on the aim tax have the structures appropriate , including of the courts independent . 
they must recognize the law of the right . 
honourable senators , . has many stressed on the question of the confidentiality . 
if of the businesses must do case addition - sea and that in reason of a agreed allowing of avoid the double tax they are held of book their Finance and their guideline of operating to a other country , we must be are that these country not use these information that to the for for in the agreed tax and not for of other ; . 
the experience me has learned that in of many other country , the confidentiality is a concept who not there not . 
if a Department receives of the information , he is least respectueux of the rules of procedure , of the confidentiality and of the rights of the special and of the citizens . 
fortunately , the number of these country falling , but they are still a about of concern . 
in May 1998 , same if we had adopted the bill of bill allowing of avoid the double tax , we we said that the Department of the Affairs foreign should proceed to a analysis complete for see if the country with which we we sign a agreed allowing of avoid the double tax had a record acceptable in the of respect of the rights of the human and of the guarantees appropriate in the of provision , of practice and of procedure . 
we must we ensure that when we covenant the agreed in question , we not help not to so to our citizens and to the citizens of this country . 
this observation has been made in this chamber . 
we we out to the Department of the Affairs foreign and that to the other departments responsible and to the Senate that all the agreements of this type should be internally to the light of that . 
honourable senators , I I said to the representatives of the Affairs foreign that a bill of bill allowing of avoid the double tax not should not be presented to the Parliament without a analysis complete of the respect of the rights of the human by the country in question . 
. we has guaranteed that this kind of analysis would in the sense of this that the government of the time occupation as a good practice . 
however , the suggestions that we we made to the opportunity of this bill of bill not have not had of the , seems he . 
I me am of the fact that the senator Lynch - Lynch that defended with as of s the question of the respect of the rights of the human , and the Senate should the in thank . 
he has has in question the choice of the committee which this bill of bill would referred . 
must - he the refer strictly to the committee of the Banking or , this who is more logical , to the committee of the Affairs foreign ? 
I am pleased that the Senate that referred this bill of bill to the committee of the Affairs foreign . 
in the intervention , the senator Lynch - Lynch has indicated that we should , in this chamber , join our actions day to our talk words to the about of the respect of the rights of the human . 
I think that we should to the of these comments . 
in this chamber , we are very proud of our reports . 
when these reports are adopted to the unanimously , I am more confiante of the fact that we believe that the out of policy and the recommendations made in our reports have of the value and that the government should in to the . 
in our report on the Asia - Pacific , to the page 97 , we we said that the policy foreign the the of factors own to promote the respect of the rights of the human , as the good management of the Affairs public , the democratization and the society civil , the law of the right and the need of a there independent . 
the list not is not exhaustive , but he there has place of to the of these factors before that we not we engagions in of the agreements and of the relations with of other country . 
, the page 109 of our report , we we spoke of the principles of a policy Canadian consistent in the of rights of the human . 
he becomes of more in more obvious that the questions of trade and of Investment not should not be examined alone of the rights of the human and of the democracy . 
we we out in our report a remarks introduced by the hon. Lloyd Axworthy , in which he has said that the rights of the human and the policy foreign menaient to a approach great raisonnée to the regard of the trade international and of the Affairs foreign . 
by therefore , as the committee the has mentioned in the report , the trade and the Investment not are not taken alone . 
he must the consider squeeze with the rights of the human . 
he is extremely important , honourable senators , that the image that plans the government of the Canada in the world slow to a approach systematic , consistent and raisonnée to the regard of the rights of the human . 
he not must not from the rights of the human of the other questions . 
the rights of the human inspire all our plans of action and all the laws . 
we must examine all the issues . 
before the committee of the Affairs foreign , the representatives of the new Agency of the income have influencing that they not had examined that the two questions of the evasion tax and of the double tax , because this is the mandate who their has been done . 
however , a of the problems , this is that we not we more of Department of the Revenue . 
the new agency not is not set to the same practices and to the same principles that a Department plain must respect . 
the employees of the Department of the Revenue not have not the same responsibilities to assume . 
I out that because , in the chapter of introduction of the report of November 99 , to the page 18 , the Auditor General has said : 
however , I am that the government not that not considered enough their impact on the accountability of accountable and the Economy . 
of by their nature , these mechanisms it in question the relations redditionnelles compulsory where the ministers their the of their political and programs to the Parliament and , by the through of the Parliament , to the citizens in General . 
given given that of the third are parties commission to these mechanisms , the ministers not are never fully responsible of them . 
in some case , . has intentionnellement established of the mechanisms of way completely independent of the ministers , well that they so make of the funds and of the powers federal . 
without accountability of accountable and without Economy appropriate , these mechanisms can so to the ability of the Parliament of examine in full the use who is made of the powers federal and of protect the right of the citizens to a accountability of accountable of the share of the government . 
the Agency of the income the in implement a policy tax . 
she is with of a mandate required and she the be . 
when . has asked to these people the they the concern of questions such the rights of the human , the healthy management of the Affairs public and the ability constitutional , they have answered that they the in remettaient to the Affairs foreign . 
if the Department of the Affairs foreign the that he there has presence of a relationship diplomatic with a government , the Agency of the income the in the that . 
that not fact not part of the mandate , for the moment of the least . 
the Department of the Affairs foreign is therefore the body who should examine these country to of see if this is the kind of country with which we should sign of the agreements international . 
of after the testimony of senior officials of the Affairs foreign , he is clear that he not there not to the within of their Department a process independent and systematic who being of determine that the country with which we concluons of the agreements for avoid the double tax are well of the country with which we wish alters and expand our relations . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch has quoted the example of the Ouzbékistan . 
the record of the Ouzbékistan not is not copy . 
the Ouzbékistan is still mortgaged by the vestiges of the Union Soviet . 
he has well made few changes , but he not has not amended substantially his way of manage the Affairs public . 
. there has registered of the abuse of the rights of the human and the situation of the rights of the human is still such in Ouzbékistan that that should we concern . 
by , , the Ouzbékistan has signed of the pactes international the positively to respect the rights of the man . 
we we to the least that a indication that the country acceptance of put his practices internal to a control international . 
the Union Soviet him has left a heritage disastrous on the plans environmentally and policy . 
this who me concern , this is that human not the is concern of whether systematically the situation of the country situations in the bill of bill S - 3 . 
I not know not how of other country , by example the Algeria , the Bulgaria , the Jordan , the Japan , the Lebanon and the Luxembourg , the compare to the Ouzbékistan , and I not know not where they the Kraft by report to a standard World in the of rights of the man . 
I not know not the principles or practices who we allow of decide if such or such country deserves that we traitions with him . 
human not seems have dependent the problem . 
well that I am of agreed with the principle of the conventions to to avoid the duplicates Socialist , I remains outset that we not should not identify of country in particular as that we not we are not amorphous , in good government that we are , of the integrity . 
he would unfair of suspending a country of the list of the bill of bill S - 3 without have to the pre s systematically all the other with which we we concluded a such agreement . 
as . the knows , the Portugal and the Luxembourg , by example , are of the country who , as the Canada , are members of the NATO and of the OECD and therefore , we are relatively are of their political . 
the Canada has always taken as reference the Declaration Universal of the rights of the man and the is tried of judge the country by report to a standard similar . 
we not take no country particular to as of example . 
when we not people not with a country or when we damning of have of the relations with a country , this is that , after the have felt according some principles , we feel that this country not has not satisfy to the criteria . 
he is clear , of after our analysis of the bill of bill S - 13 , that the government not has not established of standards . 
the government not has not respected the requests that him had way the committee to that he which of the standards . 
he would therefore unfair of pointer a country of the doigt to this at . 
I not think not that we should judge the people and the country to the accident . 
he must judge of manner consistent and systematic . 
this approval is linked to the respect of the rights of the human , to the principle of the good government , to the law of the right and to the independence of the there which I I spoke . 
the message that we let also to our citizens , this is that they must respect the rule of the double tax and that they must provide of the information financial to a other country . 
we must we ensure that , when we covenant these agreements who the these to the businesses who of any do case to the abroad , we begin of ways of ensure to this that the information declared by our businesses not be not used to of the for malicious and that our citizens not be not victims of measures or of treatment who would contrary to the standards Canadian . 
honourable senators , I I raised the question more of a time , with force I the hope . 
the bill of bill S - 3 shows that we not we not succeeded the test . 
by therefore , I could to say that of other country have failed also . 
we must to of the order home we . 
the Minister Axworthy about of a policy foreign based on of the principles . 
I ask to the government of the Canada and to the Department of the Affairs foreign of to these words in application for that , when we properly before of the next bill of bill in the of double tax , the officials so we ensure that of the standards exist and that they are respected by the country with which we covenant the agreements . 
the hon. Nicholas W . Taylor : 
honourable senators , I I listened with interest the senator Andreychuk , who has spoke of experience . 
I am a member recent of the committee of the Affairs foreign , but , in the framework of my work in the world of the Affairs , I am went in a 20 of country . 
I acknowledge that he not is not also easy that he believe of be sitting to the Senate and of speak of the sense moral and of the rights of the human in the other country and of measurement their degree of respect of these rights according our own standards . 
that me fact think to the legendary vowels of Procruste . 
when the invited of the home were too great for the reads , Procruste their coupait the feet , and the they were too grandchildren , he their étirait the members . 
, some ways , is the kind of argument that the senators of the other side are point ; as Procruste , they believe that the country must the adapt to our reads , fault of what we not should not do case with him . 
we must examine some aspects as the Environment and the trade , and not only the of the rights of the human . 
, the over of the years , I I found that the better way of do to of good ideas , this is by the through of the trade . 
that back can - be to the time where the Portugais have began to the to in Africa , in Asia and and of the . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
that we has given the slavery ! 
the senator Taylor : 
yes , a great number of bad ideas have also been importées in the New third . 
however , the trade seemed be the better way of improve the rights of the human and the activity human in each region . 
he had of the effects benefit . 
. not cannot compare this who the was to the 16 century to the situation current . 
we we fact of the progress and he seems that we the must primarily to the trade - and not not because that of the country decision that they are best that the other and that they say of the associate with of other States to least that these the not among also good that them . 
this is a way 3:00 of to the question . 
the he marshalling , but is still in deçà of the level hoped , we should the encourage in by to nothing with him . 
however , the he régresse and removes of the people of rights which they enjoyed a generation before , we should can - be use the trade as a way we allowing of the people to respect more their Environment and the rights of the human . 
my training of géologue me value can - be to think that we must determine the they made or régressent . 
if a state marshalling , same the he not has not still reached our level , he worth can - be the only of nothing with him . 
the senator has spoke of the Ouzbékistan . 
we we are people all two in this part of the world . 
this not is can - be not a good idea of choose this country because that he the find to side of the Afghanistan , who is gouverné by a regime taliban . 
I a same the Canada to the challenge of be very tolerant the he had of the Veterans talibans to his border , patrouillant the mountains . 
not forget not the problems who confronting the government of the Ouzbékistan . 
he not has not to active the Railway with of the groups harshness and his as the Conservatives , the NDP - Conservative or the Liberal ; his situation is all other . 
by therefore , he is a little unfair of say that he should use the same system . 
personally , I am of notice that the Ouzbékistan fact of the progress outstanding . 
for have past of the time in Iran and in Afghanistan , I am in legislation of say that the Ouzbékistan is in advance on them of several years - light to some ways . 
for in to to our about , he becomes difficult of measurement the progress registered . 
we not can that attempt of determine if these country made and we remind the importance historic of the trade since of the time immémoriaux . 
if the . not to the first authors grecs who écrivaient on the influence of the Grèce in Africa , . note that this is the trade who has for to the culture and to the ideas of the propager of a region to the other . 
he must have confidence and believe that if the ideas and the crops are good , this are they who finiront by survive , rather that of the ideas and of the crops funestes who are that a society régresse on the plan of the respect of the rights of the human . 
of way general , honourable senators , despite few reculs here and that , the humanity seems advance and this is to the trade that she the must . 
he so sometimes that she the hundred to the missionaries , be before , be after , but the trade is almost always the way the more effective and the more impartiale of do circulation the ideas and the crops . 
I not am not of agreed with these people or these groups who trying of we say , here to the Canada , that we not should not deal with a country determined because that he not reached not some standards . 
I continues of believe that to long term , the trade make the Canada and the world best . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , the senator Taylor acceptance he of answer to a question ? 
the senator Taylor : 
certainly , same if I am very he this last . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
I am some that that not will not many of the time . 
the senator we , a argument that I I heard he there has five years in from of the government who " that he must from the trade of the question of the respect of the rights of the human . 
more recently however , the Minister Axworthy has clear established that he there has a link between the trade and the rights of the human . 
the senator has raised to fair as a idea with which I am all to fact of agreed , this is - to - say that he would try of see if a country the improving or fact of the efforts for the improve to the chapter of the rights of the human , or the he régresse in this area . 
my question includes two consistently . 
all of first , the senator not believes - he not that the policy of the government of lier the two areas is fair ? 
second , not is - he not of notice that the standard which I was equivalent to the principle that he had mentioned , this is - to - say of determine if a country marshalling or régresse in the matter of the rights of the human ? 
the senator Taylor : 
honourable senators , I am happy that the senator from that we must assessment differently the country who argue and made and those who régressent or suppriment of the rights . 
certainly , the weapon ultimate of the trade , this are the sanctions . 
we we had point to the sanctions trade in Africa , though some say that they not have not had many of effects supportive . 
we we had point to the sanctions in Bosnia ; this is this who has caused the problem of the Kosovo in a some legislation . 
I not want not have the air of a rebel , but I not locks not also closely the trade and the rights of the human that not the fact our Minister of the Affairs foreign , according the hon. senator . 
I not am not the to this point . 
let a little our relationship with the China . 
our trade commercial with the China are many and this trade we quoted many of money , but the standard implemented to this country seems postpone of the that we produced for the Ouzbékistan , where we not achetons that few cuirs and peaux . 
other said , we must ensure to this that a economy important in some regions not his not all they of effects délétères . 
I believe all of same that the trade is the better way of improve of such situations . 
the Minister of the Affairs foreign not me has not poses that a region whatever the is better scope because that we had the end to our trade commercial with she .

tributes to the opportunity of his retirement 
the hon. Joyce Fairbairn : 
honourable senators , I like , to the behalf of the Senate , say a word of Adieu Special to a man that I am proud of power call friend , Mr. Richard Lank , our Clerk Deputy , who the his retirement . 
I not like not that Richard we leaving before that he be said publicly how I me fiais to the wisdom , to the know and to the skills that he off generously to my clause , and that , well before that I not between to the Senate . 
in read the vitae vitae yesterday , I I learned that he had began his career here in as that page , in 1956 . 
this is the year same where I quittais on for a walking who was me to , in company of other young students Canadian and American , a little across to the country and until to the Nations Nations during a week . 
I had then 16 years and I not was never for more to the is that cardiology Hat . 
but we we all the two attrapé the virus who deadline these walls and we in we fact the place of work of any a life . 
the first priority was , well course , of meet a some Jean Sutherland , who was considered with all the respect who understandable as , and I quote , " the lady who who the Senate " . 
of after this that I I could to to the time , she seemed Establishing a part key of the good operating of these site . 
jean Sutherland had a young including who knew to little close all on the operating of the Senate , the steps of the legislation and the traps in which can into a government négligent who not respect not the procedure in the of consultation and of cooperation . 
he was that also for prevent the people as me of embêter Jean Sutherland and he was therefore be to the aware of all this that she was . 
the including in question , this is well course Richard Lank . 
addition his skills , Richard was a man charming and we are immediately their of very good friends , same if I the died in principle when someone something walked of go difficulty . 
I broaden until to say that the Senate of the Canada not has never had of employee also loyalist that Richard Lank . 
little importait the pressure , this who him importait , this was that all works well in this place and not not the concerns of his occupants , what that was their party . 
I not the I never seen losing patience or the sense of the humour , contrary to me . 
I regret that he that decided of we leave , but I know that his family real - Ethel , Lesley and Steven - will aspects of be the centre of the attention . 
I want ensure to Richard that we properly always friends . 
I him question all my best best for the new challenges and the new aventures that the life him contingency . 
the hon. Sharon Carstairs : 
honourable senators , when Richard Lank is came here in 1956 , he was part of a new group of senators who " of the people as Chubby Power , David Croll , Hartland Molson , Denise McQueen Fergusson and my father , Harold Connolly . 
, from of the time where he has began to work in this chamber , I I began for my share to come visit this chamber , because I I frequently with my father to the over of his first years here . 
I know if Richard the knows , but this is to because of me that a Cadillac has in has struck a other before the into of the Senate when the woman of the senator Basha has stressed for that I conduise the Cadillac of the senator Basha . 
him and me we memories that to the time , he there had still of the business of sculpture in over in the couloirs . 
. montait and démontait the échafaudages and of the day to the next apparaissait a new gargouille . 
this are the fond that I I in as that young daughter of 12 to 15 years errant around of this place . 
I sharing these fond with Richard Lank . 
honourable senators , he there has a link Special between the position of Leader Deputy of the government to the Senate and the position he by Richard - this is - to - say until to the announcement of his retirement . 
each day , normally around of 10 or 11 p.m. , Richard Lank would in the office of the Leader Deputy with the " scroll " . 
many of senators know this that this is , but this are these extensive struggling of paper that held the Leader Deputy of the government and the Leader of the Opposition . 
they indicate this who will the produce in this chamber . 
I me assoyais with Richard and we deliberate if that understandable for this day - that . 
by that , I want say that Michelle MacDonald , my tireless , had great happy to seek the mistakes of Richard . 
we not in dealing not very often , but when we the were , we we amusions of the fact that the document not be not came under a form perfect as of usual . 
Michelle the joined to me for say that these times deplore in my office we are many . 
Richard was a professional consumed . 
he had a ability incredible of listen , of take note of this that he had heard and of do all this that he could for facilitate a small little the life not only to the Leader Deputy and to the Leader of the government to the Senate , but also to all the other senators in this chamber . 
I had need of the support and of the assistance , and he me the has opinions welcome with affection and humour . 
I you thank for these years during which we we worked together , Richard . 
you will we be . 
the hon. Marcel homme man : 
honourable senators , he there has here a intrigued that we not had not view . 
I believe that this event has many marquéM. Lank . 
honourable senators , I I of the difficulty to believe that the dean of the members of the staff of the two Houses can me abandon and . 
I know that after the departure I deviendrai the second more former here , after Herb Gray , of the other place . 
Mr. . Lank and me we often travelled and worked together . 
Mr. . Lank and the wife have been very his to the a of my kindred to the over of a trip and we are their of good friends . 
honourable senators , I not I not prepared of notes because that I not wanted not that my comments taking a their too official . 
Richard we will many , but I continues of believe that in end of the , he not we leaving not really . 
look - the now , all scuttled in something the comments é that we we to the regard . 
I hope do that this is this who will happen . 
however , the he wants of leave truly this place , I want that he far that for my share , I him conserverai always my friendship . 
, the behalf of all the honourable senators , I like him offer personally , to him , to the wife and to all his friends , our best best . 
the Association Parliamentary Canada - Europe 
the Assembly Parliamentary of the Organization for the security and the cooperation in Europe , held of the 13 to the 15 October 99 
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
the history and the theory of the régionalisme economic have taken life to the conference of Nantes under the leadership had of our good friend Jacques Floch , member distinguished of the Assembly national French . 
when Jacques , who is chairman of the committee of the economy of the OSCE , me has guest , in my quality of chairman - chairman of this same committee , to describe a region unique of the Canada , no not me has The more most that the North Canadian . 
if you look a chorus of senior in there , you will that the region Circumpolar is the region the more broader who rest still inexploitée and which . not has not still established the card . 
you notice that the America of the North and the Europe are géographiquement of families neighbours . 
only a étroit gave of sea harsh the States - United of the Russia , that where the people the bridge continental called Strait of Béring . 
remember - you the dream of a a to the China by the North - west who animait the first explorateurs , to begin by Jacques Cartier , who , he there has more of five centuries , the is assigned for the Canada of St. - Malo , to the North of Nantes , where has had place our conference . 
the a of the North - Western , who facing the summit of the chorus , is long of 2200 to 2900 miles nautiques , following the road exactly . 
, as of Chairman of the Group Parliamentary Canada - States - United , I I attended to a conference to Washington to the over of which the senator Murkowski of the Alaska , our Chairman American , has brossé a picture invigorating of the vision that he had esquissée to our meeting of Quebec , more earlier this year . 
he has proposed that the Canada and the States - United bonds their efforts for create a link rail North - south between the Alaska , the Yukon and the British - British , until to the border American , in achevant a section of 900 miles . 
the senator Murkowski has also talked the idea of a other Liaison rail beyond - beyond of the coasts of the Arctic . 
this Liaison rail resulting by a tunnel under the Strait of Béring until in Russia continentale . 
, this place , the Eurasia and the America of the North not are separated that by a cinquantaine of miles . 
he could therefore there have a Liaison rail and can - be same safety between the Russia , the States - United and the Canada , through to the Technology implementation to the point in Europe for the tunnel under the Manche . 
imagine that . can the to of London to Paris in are , borrowing then a transsibérien to great track for extension the Russia until to the Pacific , preferred then the Strait of Béring for achieve the Alaska , ignore quickly to the south in way by the Yukon and the British - British until to Vancouver , then filer to the south until to Hollywood or , to the is , until to New York or Halifax on the Coast Atlantic . 
all that will possible , economically , to the beginning of the next century . 
that could into the platform - form strategic of the economy World and amend profoundly the relations strategic and economic . 
I wish to thank of new Jacques Floch , of France , of we have inspired to imagine a great bill septentrional for the st century , a bill who awaited of new partnerships economic for the more great well of all the people of the world . 
I take of this opportunity for wish to all the senators a happy new millennium . 
these Canadians who have dismantling our history 
the hon. Lucie pin : 
honourable senators , the century who the work has been witness of important changes for the Canadians in all the jurisdictional of activity . 
these changes not would not been possible without the efforts tension of several women really exceptional ; of the women who not have not had afraid of work whether for obtain the justice social and of innover despite of strong oppositions . 
in as that society , we their must many . 
, the that of the new millennium , he not is that fair of the remind to our remember and of their to tribute . 
fault of time , I not cannot appoint all the world . 
if I not in appointments today today that few - few , my sincere recognition will to all the Canadians who have served the because of the equality of the women to the over of the century who the work . 
we celebrate this year the sixty - tenth anniversary of the case " human " . 
impossible of speak of evolution of the women without mention these five celebrities Canadians : 
Irene Parlby , Nellie McClung , Faries by , Henrietta Muir Edwards and Dupuis McKinney , who have country the committee judicial of the Council private to declare that the word " human " in the Act of the America of the North British incluait the women and that the women could be appointments to the Senate . 
and that say of Agnes MacPhail , first woman to be elected to the House of the Commons in 1921 ? 
without she and without these five celebrities Canadians , how of between we would here today today ? 
Ms Th Casgrain has been the first CIBC to lead a party policy . 
of 1942 to 1962 , she has been elected nine time in of the legislatures legislation federal and provincial . 
Jeanette Viviane Corbiere Lavell is a other woman exceptional who has spent his life to defend the right of the women aboriginal . 
in 1971 , she has challenged the clause 12 of the Act on the Indian , who was losing the status of Indian to the women aboriginal who épousaient of the not - aboriginal . 
the Court Supreme rejeta his request , but Sandra Lovelace décida of to the case before the Board of the rights of the human of the Nations Nations , and the Act on the Indian has been amended in 1985 . 
he there has also Madeleine Gib who , during 40 years , has been active in the movement syndical to the Quebec . 
in 1942 , she has chaired to the syndicalisation of the plants of manufacturing of Clothing Dominion Textiles who employaient particularly of the women . 
he not must not forget also fire senator Yvette Rousseau , who has been a of the pionnières of the syndicalisation in the plants of manufacturing of the which . 
he not must not forget Kay Livingston , chairman contemporaries of the Canadian Negro Women' s Association , who has been the cheville tribune of the Prime convention national of the women on to Toronto . 
the convention there still today today , a testimony sustainable of his efforts . 
between other héroïnes Canadian , mentionnonsElizabeth Bagshaw , the Dr. s Powell and the docteurLise Fortier . 
the Dr. Bagshaw has been Director of the first donor of control of the births to the Canada . 
she has led the donor of the Ontario , smuggled , of 1932 to 1966 . 
the Dr. Powell has fact of same to Toronto . 
for his share , the docteurLise Fortier has established the first donor of planning of the births to the Quebec and has fought whether for obtain the right to the free choice for the women to the Canada . 
many are the women exceptional who have dismantling our history , that this be in the areas of the policy , of the care of the health or of the rights of the human . 
all . fact evidence of courage , of tenacity , of leadership and of ability . 
without they , the Canada not would not the democracy article , prosperous and copy that he is today today . 
hope that the st century will as of héroïnes that this last decade . 
and so these words of Nellie McClung sustains our héroïnes of tomorrow :

question PERIOD PERIOD 
the agriculture and the agroalimentaire 
the fate of the farmers céréaliers of the Western - - response to the report of the committee of the House of the Commons 
the hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
I I been very Whip of read this morning in the National Financial that the Prime Minister the tighten on the question of the crisis in the agriculture only after the period of the celebrations . 
I there of the questions to this about since a year and half . 
the first ministers provincial and same Dennis Mills now - and I him in know grateful - indicate that they will draw the attention of the Calgarians of Toronto to the way of a day of lot . 
the committee of the agriculture of the House of the Commons the is the in the Prairies and I I participated to two of his eight meetings . 
this committee has fact of the excellent work . 
he has recognized that he there of serious problems , that the agriculture is in crisis and that the program ACRA not give not the results hoped . 
the committee has he fact share of his findings to the Prime Minister and to the cabinet ? 
I believe understand that the House of the Commons not approaches probably not his business before the 7 February . 
the committee has he fact of the recommendations to the Prime Minister and to the cabinet to the the of this that he has found in the Prairies ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I say as the hon. senator that the committee of the House of the Commons has fact a excellent work during that he was in the Prairies . 
he there has heard of the opinions strong which he has fact share to the Prime Minister , to the Minister of the Agriculture and to of other ministers . 
the Prime Minister has had the opportunity of speak to the members of the cabinet of the tour of the committee in the Prairies and he is very to the aware of the problem . 
he the can that he not there that not , as he has been said in the clause , of meeting if of the first ministers of here ë , but nothing not allows of assume that the Prime Minister has decided of to this problem on a seaway of garage . 
the senator Gustafson : 
honourable senators , . can the ask what degree of emergency the situation will achieve before that the Prime Minister the in ' . 
the Prime Minister has he met the committee ? 
I was Secretary Parliamentary of the Prime Minister Mulroney and he not in was not as that that for organizing to the people who had a serious problem a meeting with him . 
this committee has fact a wonderful work - and I was that for the see . 
he has recognized that the program ACRA not operated not , that he was fully réorienter the sector agricultural affected and that this was a problem national very serious . 
I not can understand why he not uniting not to obtain a meeting with the Prime Minister . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
on what ground of golf is - he ? 
this is this that he must discover . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I know what meetings have could have place between the Prime Minister and the members of this committee . 
I know however that the members of the committee , individually or in group , have fact share of their opinion to the Prime Minister , to the Minister of the Agriculture and to of other also . 
as to the arrangements who will taken for the held of a meeting if , I not in know nothing for the time . 
I am am that the Prime Minister knows the opinions of the members of the committee and that he the looking of the problem to the over of the next weeks and of the next months , same the he not there has not of meeting if of the first ministers . 
the difficulties of the céréaliculteurs of the Western 
the hon. David Tkachuk : 
honourable senators , I I a question supplementary to question to this regard . 
if the mother deDavid Wappel was of meet the Prime Minister present rather that the precedent , I think that David Wappel croupirait always in other . 
of the Senators : 
the senator Tkachuk : 
well well , the time is come of abolish the their in this room ! 
the senator Graham : 
. reasonable . 
posez a question . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
I the am . 
of this side - this of the chamber , we we been very patients . 
we posons these questions since a year and half . 
this not is not as if we not the had fact that yesterday . 
I the I fact me also . 
same of the senators of in opposite the have fact ; this is the case , including , of the senator Sparrow . 
we we asked this question to again occasions and the only response that we we obtenue , this is : " We will examine that . 
can - be that the program fact is . " 
all the world knows to the Canada that the program fact is . 
the Prime Minister the abstiendra he of give of the loans and of the grants in his riding during the period of the celebrations or continue he of open all major the vannes of the Board public for his riding during that he the fermera for the Prairies ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the Prime Minister remain very he with all the problems economic of the country and he not will that very little of during what that be the period of the year . 
I not want not fall the serious of the situation with which are to the taken the farmers , in the Prairies including . 
however , I wish to remind to the honourable senators that the government the is committed to provide a assistance not least . 
of any obviously , the program - as we the we said to the over of the debate to the Senate - not give not the results hoped . 
we we are engaged to the review and to ensure to this that the money be paid more quickly to the farmers . 
in addition , since my arrived , 170 million of $ of more have been RCMP to the program . 
the Prime Minister Romanow , who wish so a assistance Supplementary , has chosen of not not the Engage to be the same amount same if the agreement on the funds additional for that the province must the do . 
I not in am not course , but I think that the Prime Minister Romanow has presented a budget all recently . 
what that he in be , the government provincial not seems not have provided of give of new appropriation . 
he the summer of in clamour to the government federal . 
Mr. . Romanow the vaunts since few years already of his surpluses budget successive . 
he in is very proud , and to fair as of , . 
however , the he to to the problem , he will that he the this to table him also . 
the difficulties of the céréaliculteurs of the Western - - Awaiting of a response of the Prime Minister 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I I a question supplementary for the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
the Prime Minister Romanow has been advised , to my notice , of not not invest more in a bad program . 
I believe by therefore that the response given by the Leader of the government not dédouane not this last . 
the Saskatchewan souhaiterait that the Prime Minister starts by clear indication that the question the concern . 
a such statement convaincrait the people of the province that the Canada the to heart his interests . 
then , he will indication that of the neutralizes will Regional . 
, this day , we we had right to the speech nobles of the ministers and other members , but the Prime Minister not in has certainly not fact a priority . 
if the Leader of the government not the méprend on the intentions future of the Prime Minister , then the better something that he can do to the opportunity of ë this is of we give a sign tangible . 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I am someone little in disagreement with the approach generous of the senator to the regard of the Prime Minister of the Saskatchewan . I not am not a expert in the the , but . me said that the provinces have participated to the to of these criteria . 
he there has had a process and he the was of a program earnings . 
he is true that the program not works not as he the must . 
we we discussed of that here and to of other places . 
the program not is not also effective that he the should and the Minister of the Agriculture has said that the gaps should be examined and corrigées . 
the senator Tkachuk : 
a government of coalition ! 
the senator Boudreau : 
I not I not the figures in with , but I me remind have read that the government of the Saskatchewan had reduced of way important the assistance made in the sector of the agriculture . 
these cuts were of the order of 60 à70p. per on ten years . 
I think that he him responsibility to the least of say that he is prepared to débloquer of the funds . 
the government federal has spent 170 million of $ to the program . 
if this program had provided a funding of existing , the government federal would could say that he not would not be these 170 million of $ to least that the Prime Minister Romanow not toward a amount same . 
that would been consistent with the program earnings . 
the government federal not in has nothing fact . 
the Prime Minister Romanow not has not provided a funding and he not has not offered of other funds to my knowledge . 
the senator Andreychuk : 
as my mother the say , . not répare not a inequity by a other inequity . 
if the Prime Minister Romanow not fact not this who the is or not has not fact this who the numbers , this not is not a apologize for the Prime Minister of the Canada . 
he is responsible to the regard of all the country . 
we we need of a signal of the share of the Prime Minister and of human of other for that the people know that the problems of the Saskatchewan are important and that he does the there deal . 
that would in a broad legislation of improve the fate of the people of the Saskatchewan which the future is agony . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I understand the concern raised by the senator Andreychuk . 
I am sure that this problem who tragedy the farmers of the Prairies concern the Prime Minister . 
as I the I fact in the past , I will certainly do share to the Prime Minister and to the Minister of the Agriculture of the discussions who have had place in this chamber . 
the Affairs Intergovernmental 
the Ontario - - Act on the restructuring regional - - determination of the power legal of the city of Ottawa 
the hon. Jean - Robert Gauthier : 
honourable senators , the board City of Ottawa has discussed and adopted yesterday a motion Requesting to the province of the Ontario of finding formally bilingual the city of Ottawa who will created the year next . 
according a clause The in the newspaper - Droit today today , the new city not will not the right of the finding bilingual . 
in effect , a decision of the Court Superior of the Ontario would said , in 1986 , in the case of Kapuskasing , that this city not had or the right or the power of the finding formally bilingual . 
this is therefore a other Moores in the mare ! 
of a share , the bill 25 , habilitant the restructuring of the new city of Ottawa , is service on the question . 
I recommends that the bill enabling which and reclassification the quoted of Ottawa formally bilingual in French and in English . 
the province would answered that the new board who will elected , in November 2000 , will the power of decide of the status linguistic of the new quoted of Ottawa . 
the Minister can - he we say if the Prime Minister of the Ontario role to the issue in this case in knowing very well that the new quoted of Ottawa not can not the declare formally bilingual , with the equality of the rights in English and in French ? 
the Minister can - he ensure this House that he cherchera to do clarification this question by the legal and to end to the uncertainty and to the confusion done by the decision Mr. Harris ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , the question raised by the hon. senator Gauthier has been scope to my attention more earlier today today . 
I I could me information to this about . 
the new pay , as all the municipalities of the province and , in fact , of the country , provincial in effect legally of the government provincial and is set to the bill provincial . 
she ( the authority in the framework constitutional . 
this authority him is cheap by a bill provincial . 
of after my knowledge and my information , the new pay of Ottawa , as any other pay of the province of the Ontario , not has or the jurisdiction or the authority , in under of the bill who stewardship the municipalities , for the declare bilingual . 
he there a bill in Ontario on the Benefit of services in French who allows to the municipalities of offer some services bilingual by stopped City . 
in fact , the pay can decide that of the services will services in the two languages in a case or in the other . 
however , that not him give not the right of the declare formally city bilingual . 
. me has said that this is the province of the Ontario who Canada this power . 
the former city of Ottawa , if I can the call and , has acted in under of this bill and of regulations municipal for offer of the services bilingual . 
. me has explained that these services bilingual remain in place until to this that of the regulations municipal changed that . 
determine if the new city of Ottawa will formally bilingual provincial of the only jurisdiction of the province of the Ontario . 
the hon. Serge Joyal : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government and the on the same question . 
when I I had the opportunity of take the speak to the Senate this week , our colleague , the senator Grafstein , has spoke of the possible that the government federal recoure to the authority on the Administration regional of the capital national or to the power of cancellation . 
I was of notice that the second proposal not would not the welcome as Prime choice . 
yesterday , the Minister of the Affairs Intergovernmental has said : : 
we must examine the ways constitutional which we begin for help to deal the situation in the circumstances current . 
according the newspaper The Toronto Star of today today , of the experts of the Constitution feel that the government federal could would the sustains of a decision of the Court Supreme of the Canada made in the years 60 and him easier the power of legislation when he the is of questions related to the capital national . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate will he to the Minister of the Justice and prosecutor General of the Canada if , in under of the decision of the Court Supreme of the Canada , the government federal can point the power General of legislation on of the questions related to of the problems national , there including to the capital national , for do of the new city of Ottawa a city bilingual ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
I am course that all the honourable senators prefers that this problem be resolved in the framework of a intervention clear of the province of the Ontario to to declare the capital national formally bilingual . 
the government has indicated that he analysis the choice possible . 
no decision not has still been taken to this regard . 
. can still hope that the Prime Minister Harris and the government interviendront of way valid . 
if , I am course that I can i the ask of the hon. senator Joyal and ask to the Minister appropriate of the look also on this possible if she not is not already to the study . 
the hon. Gerald J . Comeau : 
honourable senators , the senator has asked the question that I had in head . 
the status of city bilingual represents a little more that the allocations of services bilingual to Ottawa . 
Ottawa , the capital of our nation , must send a message clear across to the country in to a status bilingual . 
I out with force that this status of city bilingual represents more that the allocations of services in French . 
the senator Boudreau : 
I thank the hon. senator of this comment . 
, this regard , the pay not has not of power . 
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , my question Supplementary the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
I I asked a question to the senator Joyal to the about of the power of repeal . 
he has answered and I I since during discovered that the power of repeal has been used regularly until to he there has about a Î of years . 
I believe understand that he is piece in into . 
he there of the points of view constitutional on this question , but he is always provided in the Constitution . 
the Leader of the government to the Senate can - he ask to the prosecutor General of the Canada if , in extremis , this who according good number of between we seems be the case in this situation , the power of repeal could or not be adopted for a legislation legislative who , to our notice , not concorde not with leXXIe century and the Canada ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I am am that the prosecutor General analysis now all the solutions possible who could be adopted . 
no of between they not is a solution privileged . 
the option privileged , this is that the government and the Prime Minister of the Ontario act . 
I verrai to this that this solution be also Before to the prosecutor General . 
the hon. Marcel homme man : 
honourable senators , during six years to the Senate and 30 years to the House of the Commons , I I enough clear expressed my Position on this that is guarantee the Canada . 
in all country , he there has a capital . 
some the repeatedly the capital national , I the Order the capital federal because that this is a institution federal . 
if the capital national the must of the the history and the diversity of our country , the hon. senator Hays of the Alberta , the hon. senator Marcel homme man and the other must the there feel to the comfortable . 
I I a approach different . 
I will all do for depoliticize the question ; I will speak to a group to the Parliament torontois , the Friday 14 January , to the heart same of the Parliament provincial . 
all the senators must speak collectively , some in premier the seaway legal and of other in looking to persuade . 
finally , we should do understand to the Canadians that we not asking not that all the cities be bilingual . 
this is a other debate . 
we should do point clear - and I cannot grateful to the Minister of the express briefly that - that - that he there has a difference between the debate regarding the capital federal and all the other questions . 
this is a debate all to fact distinct . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , I say to the honourable senators , as I the I already mentioned of , , that his words very éloquents on the question , I could the do pale . 
of the points of view views here to this about he the acquiescence a sure number of things . 
first , the senators taking very to the seriously this case who is a interest capital for our country . 
second , this not is not a question of debate partisan . 
the senators of the two sides of the House the are speeches that - that and I think that we we demonstrated far that he not the is not of a question of debate partisan . 
third , that respect this city in as that she is the capital national or , as said the senator , the capital federal . 
I I expressed my point of view on the question and I faithful of the do . 
the opinions of the honourable senators are well whom and are to take to the seriously . 
I am am that the government the sharing . 
the hon. rald - A . 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
if a study is made by the prosecutor General of the Canada on the status bilingual of the capital of the Canada , not could - we not also study the clause 16 of the Constitution regarding directly the capital of the Canada and also the power résiduel of the Parliament Canadian , to the clause 95 , in under which some powers are opinions and recognized by the jurisprudence for the region of the capital national of the Canada . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , the prosecutor General is in as that Main lawyer of the government of the Canada . 
as the would all lawyer appropriate , she at the options and in , a series to the government in will that no of these options not will necessary and that the problem the dreaming other . 
I me undertake to i the essential of the remarks of the hon. senator to her the prosecutor General . 
I am am that she will all the options available , as all lawyer conscientious the would to the behalf of a client . 
the hon. Sheila Finestone : 
honourable senators , my question the question to the Leader of the government to the Senate . 
the the of the situation and of the obligation of the government of finding Ottawa formally bilingual , this along meaning - she all the principle of equality to the words of the status official , there including the equality on the plan of the rights and privileges , and not only on the of the language ? 
the question respect the expression same . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , of any obviously , the ramifications of the status fully bilingual would clarified by the court . 
I rise this commitment not only to the regard of the hon. senator Finestone , but also of the other honourable senators who are define on the about . 
the transport 
the agreed on the Administration of the airport international of Halifax - - obligation of the government federal of control the nature acide of the ardoise 
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , my question to the Leader of the government to the Senate is suscitée by the concern made regarding the arrangement between the government of the Canada and the Administration interim of the airport international of Halifax who will formally the full responsibility of the airport in February . 
of such are a problem who , to this that I thought , had been corrected to the beginning of the negotiations . 
my question the on the measures who must be taken regularly for control the nature acide of the ardoise to the airport and all around . 
as the Minister the knows , the airport the at on a Hill of where the water inch in of grandchildren affected , this who can give place to some dangers . 
the Minister has he release with the responsible of the new Administration of the airport to the about of this question to the regard of which they feel that the authorities federal are revenues on their speak ? 
the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) : 
honourable senators , I am to the aware of the situation which about the hon. senator . 
these negotiations the along as all negotiations . 
. Shipping of the two sides , this is giving giving . 
. advance his Position , . fact of the compromise . 
I I spoke to the responsible of the Administration aéroportuaire after that they have agreed and signed the agreed . 
I not think not that he that been amended after have been signed . 
the senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , he is therefore exactly that the 8,700 $ $ who have been oversight for take of the measures corrective are always part of the agreed , that , as . the claims , the federal not continue not to assume the responsibility of the damage who now of acuity to the future , and that this question has been resolved ? 
is - he exactly that a agreement to this regard is in place and that if someone something was happen , this would between now and the mid - February , when the taken in for become official ? 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , as that I the far , the agreed covers of the questions such that the liabilities environmental and the responsibility of the costs of operating , there including those who are linked to the Environment . 
the essential , this is that the agreed that the Administration and the Department of the Transport have signed was these questions and that , to my knowledge , he not has not been amended since that the Administration the has signed . 
I am sure that , as this is the case in all negotiations , the agreed not contains not all this that wanted the Administration and contains more that this that the Department of the Transport was prepared to CPAs . 
however , as that I the far , the two parties have signed a agreed final who rule the questions raised by the hon. senator . 
I know the he the rule to the satisfaction of all , but he the rule . 
he has been signed by the two parties . 
the senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , the Minister not is therefore not in legislation of we say if the 8,700 $ $ by year will available for take the measures corrective necessary . 
I am course that this is that where in are the things to the time current . 
the senator Boudreau : 
honourable senators , this brief meeting has had place he there has three weeks or more . 
for as that I me hounding , the amount of 8,700 $ $ before serve to deal this problem is her in the agreement . 
I vérifierai the data for be sure of this that I advance , but I me recall very specifically that , when I I met the group , the agreement had been signed . 
she address of all the questions and I not believe not that . that amended this agreement since during . 
the Peoples aboriginal 
ask of response to the report of the committee on the former Veterans aboriginal 
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , I commend the government of have answered in time timely to the report of the committee Special of the Senate on the security and the services of Intelligence . 
we consacrons of long p.m. to the drafting of our reports in this place and the government the afterthought often for develop his policy government . 
however , when can - we hope receive the response that we had demandée to the report of the committee Senate of the Peoples aboriginal on the former Veterans aboriginal ? 
the senator Fairbairn was Leader of the government to the Senate to the time of the Presented of this report .

the hon. J . Clairvaux Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :

I will to with the Minister responsible and try of obtain a response to the question of the hon. senator . 
I the receive probably to the over of the break and I should power the him provide to the resuming of the business . 
the the the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I regret , but the period of the questions is now completed . 
order orders OF 
bill of bill of appropriation No. 3 for 99 - 2000 
third Reading 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , this is very well that he the be expired enough of time between the Reading to the step of the report and the third Reading of the bill of bill C - 21 because that we has for of look a last will on this bill of bill . 
I attirerais the attention of the honourable senators on the fact that this bill of bill the entitled : " Act to granting to Majesty Majesty of appropriation for the Administration public federal during the year the ending the 31 March 2000 " . 
the clause 6 , to the page 3 of this bill of bill states that : 
... ... ... he is possible of of a credit fully of the , bill or of any other bill and provided to the Printed 2 after the stomping of the year following the for which he is was ... ... ... 
other said , the clause 6 of the bill of bill parliament to Authorize of the Estimates postérieurement to the 31 March 2000 . 
in the 286 Parliamentary of Beauchesne , 6e edition , he there has to the page 258 a description of the business of the subsides and Ways and ways . 
under the Order " Presented " , to the comment 933 , we can read : 
a budget of Estimates has for subject of to to the Parliament the proposals budget and extra - budget of the government for the year to come . 
honourable senators , the clause 6 of the bill of bill there a problem . 
there has he to that a explanation simple that could we do share a member of our committee of the Finance national who has examined the bill of bill in detail ? 
the hon. Anne C . Cools : 
honourable senators , I thank the hon. senator Kinsella of his question . 
if I understand well , his question has relates to the fact that a credit seems chevaucher two million . 
the he had out this point during the hearings of the committee , we have could the examine more in detail . 
I think that the same something the is has in the case of the last bill of bill of appropriation and that the senator Bolduc had then raised the question . 
I believe that the response of the Department was that the credit had been an in a only year , but that the Estimates the étendraient on two years . 
if we about of the same something - and I believe that . we had then said in substance that this not was not came - that had the air of become a practice a little more day to because of the grow and of the size of these appropriation . 
I hope that I I answered to the question of the senator , but I am interested to examine the case more in detail . 
I the said , a part of the question of the senator me has escaped . 
the senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , is the problem and is the principle . 
, the page 31 of the bill of bill , the Printed 2 for : : 
of after the Estimates Supplementary of the Estimates ( A ) of 99 - 2000 , the amount " is of 234 733 521 $ , be the total of the amounts of the positions of this budget formula to the , Printed . 
the Printed 2 add : : 
are awarded by the , bill to Majesty Majesty for the year the ending the 31 March 2 $ , " be imputées to the year in over and to the year following the ending the 31 March and for which they are awarded . 
that is particularly the Agency of the customs and of the income of the Canada , but the situation there is and well and he must the ask if the . fact well of consider a such practice . 
I not wish not to point the Rules to this regard , but the committee of the Finance national want well examine the fact that . vote a credit who must be spent to the more later the 31 March 2000 . 
the senator Cools : 
I am interested to local to the senator Kinsella that our committee - and I then consult the chairman , the senator Murray - chair this question and the will more in detail . 
if the phenomenon seems récurrent , we should seek to know why . 
I rise the criticism and the opinion of the senator very to the seriously and I me undertake to me with of this case . 
honourable senators , yesterday , in my intervention to the step of the second Reading of the bill of bill C - 21 , I I given of the details internal on the substance of the bill of bill . 
the senator Murray , chairman of the committee of the Finance national , has taken share to the debate and we has release of the information very appropriate and détaillées . 
I should however add , mid - figue , mid - they , but with many of gratitude however , that I I thought yesterday that this bill of bill had rallié the consensus of the senators , that these the thought the have enough and very seriously examined and that he had therefore been examined in good and properly form . 
by therefore , in my quality of chairman - chairman of the committee , and of the - speak of the government in this case , I am opinions yesterday and I I asked the leave of the Senate of current of a day the date of the third Reading of the bill of bill . 
honourable senators , the bill of bill deserves of be well examined . 
I thank still a time the senator Lynch - Lynch , because he was the duty of Leader of the Opposition and remplissait the role of a manner that we respect all . 
in addition , he remplissait the duty of senator . 
this duty is particularly important because the Constitution authority to the Senate a role constitutional to the regard of the bills of bill of appropriation and the bill of bill to the study the the power of spending a very very amount of money . 
I thank of new the honourable senators and I you wish to all a Joyeux ë .

( the motion is agreed and the bill of bill , read a third time , is adopted . ) 
bill of bill of 99 for the implementation in Bill of conventions tax 
third Reading 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Hervieux - Hervieux , P , seconded by the hon. senator Gauthier , Honourable to the third Reading of the bill of bill S - 3 , Act an in implement a agreed , of the conventions and of the protocoles conclude between the Canada and the Kirghizistan , the Lebanon , the Algeria , the Bulgaria , the Portugal , the Ouzbékistan , the Jordan , the Japan and the Luxembourg , in view of avoid the duplicates Socialist and of prevent the evasion tax in the of taxes on the income . 
the hon. John Lynch - Lynch ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the senator Cools of this consent Alaska , that I appreciate enormous . 
the senator Andreychuk has fact yesterday a excellent statement on the concern which the bill of bill S - 3 has given place . 
as his comments have been well expertise , I me will very short . 
, the risk of repeat some of his comments , I want simply out this who has fact the subject of the debate . 
honourable senators , he is very came that a bill of bill on a convention tax take as of time . 
I believe that this is because that we we now trend to to of the aspect financial of the treated to the of the rights of the human . 
this is a something on which . insistera , I the hope , with the years . 
the government not can blame that him - same for the interest particular that we we brought to this bill of bill , because that the Tab of breffage was because . 
the Tab of breffage to on the bill of bill was the a of the best , if the better , that I my never were . 
I like congratulate the authors of the Tab of have made a such assistance to those who the intéressaient to the bill of bill . 
honourable senators , we we given of the over to beat to the Leader Deputy of the government when we we stressed for that the bill of bill be referred to the committee of the Affairs foreign then that he her - to fair as to this time - that - for that he be referred to the committee of the Banking , as this was the used . 
the Leader Deputy has therefore fact evidence of generosity in allowing that the bill of bill be referred to the two committees . 
this was someone little fun and unsettling to this time - that , but , rétrospectivement , I believe that care has been a year an . 
the committee of the Banking has examined the conventions tax they - same , and the committee of the Affairs foreign the is interested more particularly to the country responsible - to a country in particular - and to the way which the Canada , in his policy foreign , was enter in consideration the question of the rights of the human for determine his relations with some country . 
I believe that these bills of bill should rather be claimants to the committee of the Affairs foreign because that , of more in more , the discussion Current to the conventions tax ups on the country them - same rather that on the nature of the conventions . 
these last are all enough similar . 
they are the to avoid the double tax and the aim tax . 
this is this that we we efforçons of determine in by a case particular of the Ouzbékistan , a country which the record rest enough mitigé . 
I not repeat not this that I I already said during of the debate of second Reading , but this not is not a country with which I like do of the Affairs or that I like visit in the of present of the things . 
the response that we we obtenue not is not very satisfactorily , of the least for me . 
a of the witnesses heard by the committee of the Affairs foreign was the Director of the rights of the human , of the Affairs humanitarian and of the equality of the women in the world , to the Department of the Affairs foreign and of the Trade international . 
his response has been the next : 
of a point of view Canadian , the Canada not is not a partner enough very for forward to him only a country to change his practices in the of rights of the human in him imposing of the sanctions resource . 
same of the sanctions multilateral well colleague not are not always particularly effective . 
she has also said that , until to now , the Canada not had imposed that the sanctions décidées by the Nations Nations . 
he there has many of réalisme in this observation , but he there has also , I in I well afraid , a renoncement to the principles . 
that a country be small and not that that a influence marginale - this who not is not the case of the Canada - the he has some principles , he not should not fear of the to of the before and of the respect . 
this is this that we we of obtain of the committee and of the officials of the Affairs foreign . 
yesterday , the senator Taylor has asked if we we mélanger rights of the human and trade . 
I not sharing not this point of view . 
some people believe that the commitment is the key . 
I believe that the opprobrium and the boycotts can have more of effect . 
still that , this is a Position are there for the time . 
as the senator Andreychuk the has fact yesterday , we want only well do an that , when we concluons of such treated , we not can not we settle of not look that a will distrait on the situation of the rights of the human in the country in because . 
as the senator Grafstein the has underlined to the committee of the Affairs foreign , each year , the 251 of state American prepares a analysis thorough on the record of almost all the country of the world to the chapter of the rights of the human . 
this analysis is by the the Before to the Administration and to the Congress , who in have then to their way . 
we not seem not give as of importance to this kind of work in this country . 
he not the is not of apply this who the fact , , but rather of use the ways available for do apply the principles that we we tried of adopt in this who has relates to the rights of the human . 
as some of our colleagues the know , I had the intention of propose of the amendments Requesting the been of the Ouzbékistan of the bill of bill , but I believe that I I been am . 
after have heard the senator Andreychuk and the other , I acknowledge that he not would not fair to this point - this of deal a country of way different and of the pénaliser without have coast of first more of information . 
however , now that the question has been raised , I hope that of the measures will taken for that when come the time of to to the point of new treated tax , the responsible ceaselessly their analysis more far that the drafting plain of a treaty and that they actions the of the record of this country in the of rights of the human before of decide of our commitment . 
the rights of the human not should not be the only about of consideration , but he is sure that they should do the subject of a consideration more minitieuse that the that . him would now . 
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
the senator is - he prepared to accept a brief question ? 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
well course . 
the senator Grafstein : 
I am of agreed in principle on all this that the hon. senator has said to the about of the fact that the government not the not speak the rights of the human in his policy and of the possible of associate intimately these two elements of way to exercise a pressure moral on a state fautif . 
the hon. senator has he thought , by example , to do adopt a resolution to the House who the know to the delegation Canadian with of the OSCE that the Senate of the Canada not is not satisfy of the record of the rights of the human in a country given , say the Ouzbékistan , and who for the delegation of i his very to the OSCE for debate ? 
, a the more modest , his concerns , that I sharing , could be raised to a gallery international where , with of the suasion moral , he would possible of rallier of other States to these views . 
the senator Lynch - Lynch : 
honourable senators , I thank the senator Grafstein of this excellent suggestion . 
she not me was not came to the spirit , but I be happy of there give the . 
the hon. é Hervieux - Hervieux : 
honourable senators , let - me , to the step of the third Reading , a comment on the comments of the Leader of the Opposition and that of my colleague , the senator Andreychuk . 
we not we not of dissension on the question of the principle of the rights of the human ; this is rather as to the ways for do current the rights of the human that he there has a discrepancy . 
in my speech to the step of the third Reading , I I reminded the actions of the CIDA for facilitate the learning of the respect of the rights of the human , the application of the rule of right of same that the your to advance in Ouzbékistan . 
in these conditions , the bill of bill S - 3 is in the interest General of the Canada and of the effect who benefit of the benefits of the trade . 
he will the condition of the citizens of these country and in same time , he facilitera the Progress of the rights of the human . 
when the rights basic and the survival of the individuals are protected , he is more easy of ensure the respect of these rights . 
I move the Adopted of the bill of bill S - 3 . 
( the motion is agreed and the bill of bill is read a third time and adopted . ) 
bill of bill on the Agreement final nisga' has 
second Reading - Adjourned of the debate 
given the a of the senators who are this famous region of the Canada well under the behalf of British - British , I am very happy and very proud of sponsor the bill of bill C - 9 and of in recommend the Adopted . 
I the am with the support of the other senators of the British - British of this side - this of the House , the senators Perrault and Fitzpatrick , but I hope also , in time timely , of the senators of the British - British of in opposite . 
course , I enforced the support and the symbolic of the senators of all the regions of the Canada . 
we believe that the bill of bill C - 9 offer of the north and that he avivera the desire of negotiate , this who is essential to the stability social and to the progress economic that leads all the Britannos - Columbians . 
the bill of bill which we are before marquera the history . 
he represents this that he there has of better to the Canada , this is - to - say the will of the Canadians of listen , of seek the consensus , of accept the diversity , of find of the solutions and of develop of the compromise . 
this bill of bill , who will in into the Agreement final nisga' has , in a other jalon in the negotiating of treated to the Canada to the era modern . 
with the Convention of the by James and of the North Quebec to the community of the years 70 and , more recently , with the Convention clear of the Dogrib , the Agreement on the claims land of the Nunavut and the Entente - framework final with the Indian of the Yukon , the Senate has the privilege of study of the measures legislation who bonds the Canada , who recognize the place of the Peoples aboriginal in the fabric economic and social of the Canada , and who recommend of new relations positive between the governments and the Peoples aboriginal . 
honourable senators , the Agreement final nisga' has and this bill of bill who the will in into can be included in the history of the treated of the era modern . 
our role is to see if this bill of bill reflects properly the agreed final , such that rigorous by the three parties , and the he deserves of be adopted in as that bill . 
I believe firmly that this bill of bill , and the agreed which he the quoted , well the interest of the Canadians , that he is consistent to the Constitution and to the framework legal of the Canada , and that he should be adopted . 
before of to to the questions of further , I like say to the senators who are the Nisga' as , where they live and how the agreement on their claims land and the bill of bill him giving effect are upon to the Senate for there be discussed . 
the Nisga' as live the long of the saying Nass in a region relatively insufficient of the North - west of the British - British , per kilometres to the North of Terrace and of Prince Rupert . 
addition the 2 500 Nisga' as living in four villages the long of the saying and of the embouchure , only someone 125 other people Standing roles the territory of 24 $ kilometres square of this Valley . 
the only communities organized in the Valley of the Nass are those of the Nisga' as . 
the Nisga' as living in the Valley of the Nass make the a of the many groups Cultural of the Peoples aboriginal of the Coast North - Western . 
they have a culture complex based on the off resources of the sea . 
historically , to the like of the other Peoples of the Coast North - Western , the Nisga' as were of great artists , bâtisseurs and unquestionably . 
their his rehausse always the ever of many property of their villages , to the within as to the outside . 
the salmon and the other resources of the Nass their sponsored food and Contents brutes for their his Social , arts and architecturales . 
here , on the settle of the saying River , the his cultural and arts of the Nisga' as can be admirées in the Britain Galerie of the Museum Canadian of the Civilization and a exposure recently had , " - bowl common nisga' has " . 
. in find of other in of many museums in the world . 
today today , on 5 500 Nisgas' as , 2 500 live over in four villages : 
Kincolith , Greenville , Canyon City and New Aiyansh . 
the most of the other Nisga' as live to Terrace , Prince Rupert or Vancouver . 
they attachent many of importance to the capita and to the education post . 
the Nisga' as have their own arrondissement school , the arrondissement school 92 . 
the education will of the tongue to the twelfth and the question to the Nisga' as and to the other residents of the Valley of the Nass . 
the members of the board school , which a resident not Nisga' has , are elected . 
the Nisga' as have also their own board of the services of health where the not - Nisga' as are also represented . 
he have before all the opportunities possible of take the control of the education , of the care of health , of the services social and of the services to the families and that of other programs government , always in soon of new opportunities of strengthen their families and the community . 
they have worked in cooperation with their neighbours . 
they involved to the government regional how are part of the government regional by the through of the former , Harry Nyce , who seat to the board . 
the Nisga' as understanding since to the least 1887 of deal this that they repeatedly the question of the Lands - since the time where , as the honourable senators the have already heard , the leaders nisga' s have fact their Prime trip until to the Assembly legislative of the British - British for attempt of obtain the recognition of their as aboriginal , a regulation by treaty and a some self government . 
their trip to Victoria has however been infructueux . 
in 1890 , they have established their Prime committee responsible of the question of the Lands . 
in 1913 , this committee has sent a petition to the Council private , in England , for try of obtain a regulation of the question of the Lands . 
always without success . 
of the years 20 until to the years 50 , the Nisga' as and of other Nations have seen their efforts for the recognition of their rights and of their culture réprimés . 
the Clinic of funds before serve the because of the claims land or of other rights has been closed . 
after the endangers of the bill in because in 1955 , the Nisga' as have harmful their committee responsible of the claims land . 
under the direction Mr. Frank Calder , the board tribal has before the courts of the question . 
this decision résolue shows the determination of the Nisga' as to obtain the recognition of their rights . 
many of other Nations Nations did that the courts not preventing their ask , détruisant and all hope that their rights be recognized in the framework of a process policy . 
after the rejection of the because by the courts lower , the Nisga' as have brought their case until before the Court Supreme of the Canada . 
in 1973 , the Court Supreme has the his decision in the case Calder . 
well that shared also on the question of know if the Nisga' as conservaient a as aboriginal , she has admitted the possible that the rights and 1993 aboriginal exist always to the Canada . 
this decision has many pesé on the decision of the government Trudeau of adopt a policy of negotiating of the claims land that where they not had not already been settled . 
this is now to we , after a study careful , of do our share for to this reconciliation possible . 
the Senate has also the opportunity here of support formulate the principle that that the process of negotiating of the treated in British - British be valid and necessary . 
only the negotiating , the compromise and the largeur of views can to possible the conclusion of treated who purpose to the interests of all . 
we not can advance that with the full whatsoever of all the parties interested . 
the Nisga' as have been the a of the first groups to about of the negotiations to the favour of this new process . 
the negotiations have in in 1976 . 
however , without the participation of the British - British , he was impossible of advance on the question of the Lands . 
five years after the signing of the agreed framework on the guideline of the negotiations , the government tien , the government Harcourt and the Nisga' as have signed a agreed of principle who drawing the major elements of the agreed today today to the study . 
the agreed of principle has fact the subject of debates has in the opinion and to the legislative legislative of the province . 
the principles and acceptance have determined the content and the structure of the negotiations on the agreed final . 
two years and half more later , be in August 1998 , the government tien and the government of Glen Clark have paraphé a agreed final . 
this was a great too and the What of more of a century of efforts persévérants of the share of the Nisga' as . 
have participated to this process not only four governments federal - be the governments Trudeau , Clark , Mulroney and tien - but also three governments provincial successive . 
in addition , more of 500 consultation plubliques and legislatures of information have been held in British - British . 
the treaty nisga' has in a step in the long history of the conclusion of treated with the Nations Nations to the Canada . 
this is the Prime treaty Canadian to be the self government , a self who respect the rights of the Nisga' as in the framework legal of the Canada and who has been négociée in they the of the rights of all the Canadians . 
in this context , I wish to quote here a statement that the Minister of the Affairs Indian and of the North Canadian , the hon. Robert D . Nault , has made , the 26 October 99 , to the House of the Commons , to the over of the debate of second Reading . 
is this that he has said : 
the government believe that the self government is , to the like of the other rights of the aboriginal , whose and every by the clause 35 of the Act constitutional of 1982 . 
as the courts the have mentioned , he worth better negotiate these rights that of let the question be scope in justice , and this is s this that we we fact . 
I want now give a view of the way which will the government nisga' has , because I believe that the agreed shows that . can negotiate the to of a government aboriginal effective and responsible and be of the provisions practices to this regard . 
the Act on the Agreement final nisga' has and the Agreement final nisga' has improve including to modernize the government nisga' has and to create a structure government democratic , responsible and effective for the Nisga' as . 
the Minister of the Affairs Indian and of the North Canadian not will more the last word in the decisions to uniqueness regional . 
of the line important to the self government of the Nisga' as who are for in the Act on the Indian not the these more and the Nisga' as will in legislation of the give a government who covers their communities and all the members of the nation nisga' has . 
I know that our colleague of the Saskatchewan , in opposite , the senator Tkachuk , has thorough , in the bill of bill S - 14 , the about of the self government of the aboriginal . 
he can see with of other that number of the powers who are Duty to the government nisga' has are similar to those who were situations to the Printed of the former bill of bill S - 14 . 
the government nisga' has will a government democratic to the within of the model Canadian established . 
of first , all the men and the women nisga' as to reached the age adulthood will the to candidates to the election and vote for the representatives of their government . 
by example , he must be of the lines guidelines on the conflict of interests and of the mechanisms to to ensure the responsibility financial , as this is the case for of other governments of the Canada . 
he must assume this responsibility to his own citizens and to the governments which he tirera a part of his funds . 
the Constitution nisga' has is to the heart of the year of a government nisga' has democratic . 
this government will pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution of the Canada . 
the treaty states of the conditions specific of the Constitution nisga' has who must be respected . 
they not can be have by no government nisga' has to come . 
the treaty contains also of the provisions to to protect the rights of the other aboriginal and those of the not - Nisga' as who live in of the Lands nisga' as . 
the Constitution nisga' has must ensure the recognition and the protection of the rights and of the freedoms of the citizens nisga' as and offer the possible of one the would of the laws nisga' as . 
she must also renfermer of the elements key , as of the mechanisms allowing of in call of the decisions administrative and of have access to the information . 
the government nisga' has imagine of the aspects unique to the culture and to the heritage of the Nisga' as , but he will very celebrating as government similar to of other governments of the Canada . 
he can and will the politically and legally responsible of the decisions that he will . 
the government Lisims will also responsible to the Prime Leader of the relations with of other levels of government . 
the four governments of the villages nisga' as composeront the second level of the government nisga' has . 
the Treaty nisga' has the also the of the Nisga' as living to the outside of the Lands nisga' as . 
the treaty establishes three local urban , be Terrace , Prince Rupert and Grand Vancouver . 
they not have not of powers devise but may to the government nisga' has in electing each a member of the government Nisga' has Lisims . 
strictly - we now on the powers devise of the Nisga' as . 
the only powers devise that the Nisga' as will are through in the treaty . 
I wish to remind to the honourable senators that he not there has not of powers devise taxation to the Nisga' as . 
the laws federal and provincial the these to the Lands nisga' as in same time that the laws nisga' as . 
that ressemblera to this who the fact on the other territories of the Canada where the Canadians are subject to the legislation federal , provincial , municipale or regional . 
in this type of model , of the rules of priority are necessary for establish this who will the to in case of conflict or of weakness between two laws Criteria . 
the treaty nisga' has contains some rules of priority in each case where the government nisga' has will of the powers devise . 
for that the laws nisga' as be Criteria , they must respect these rules of priority . 
they must the plier to a sure number of other requirements . 
of first and before all , they must be ensure to the Constitution of the Canada , there including the Charter Canadian of the rights and freedoms . 
they must be also ensure to the Constitution nisga' has . 
honourable senators , I want make clear that the powers that I just of mention to the about of the citizenship nisga' has not understand not the right of take of the laws regarding the Immigration , the citizenship Canadian , the it in as that Indian to the words of the Act on the Indian or the possible of impose to the Canada or to the British - British the obligation of offer of the rights or of the benefits . 
. the specific very clear in the treaty nisga' has . 
finally , he is of the areas where the interests of the other Canadians could be substantially and directly RCMP by the bill nisga' has , but where the interest public is respected all in leaving to the authorities local a sure power . 
in this third category , the laws federal and provincial priment on the bill nisga' has . 
the laws federal and provincial primeraient and in the areas of the protection of the Environment , of the order public , of the peace and of the security , of the services of health , of the services social , of the vessels and of the business public , of the flow safety and of the transport , of the Women of the mariages , of the sales of the products of the whaling and of the fishing , and of the regulatory of the marine intoxicantes . 
he not fact no doubt that the government nisga' has will in the framework legal and legislative Canadian , and in the respect of the Constitution Canadian and of the Charter of the rights and freedoms . 
honourable senators , the Nisga' as Ouje in the Valley of the Nass since of the centuries already before the arrived of the Europeans . 
we know that their society was well hosted , prosperous and Economy by of the rules of conduct social and of responsibilities to the community . 
the Main achievement of this treaty has been of integrate the culture and the system of government own to the Nisga' as to the culture and to the system of the majority . 
as I the I said all to the time , this is a arrangement practice . 
honourable senators , the a of the major objectives of the negotiations of the treated in British - British is of create of the certitudes in this who respect the rights of the aboriginal by report to the rights of the governments federal and provincial , and of the people Canadian . 
the Agreement final nisga' has satisfy this objective . 
he is a definition complete and clear of the claims of the Nisga' as opposite to the rights and 1993 aboriginal . 
through to this agreed , and as he is provided in the bill Bill C - 9 , these rights will submission known . 
, the future , we properly in legislation of use the agreed final for describe specifically the rights of the Nisga' as . 
each of between we can use the agreed final because that the treaty for that he can serve not only to the government and to the Nisga' as , but to all the world . 
he is important for the groups of businesses and the groups academia of the British - British that the situation be clear . 
of the groups to of the interests also various that the Canadian National and the Congress of the work of the Canada have fact know to the committee Standing of the House that the certainty was to the basic of their support to this treaty and to the signing of treated in General . 
the mayor of the city of Terrace , Jack Talstra , has said to the committee Standing : 
we speaks all our best to our neighbours nisga' as . 
will of the before with this treaty . 
honourable senators , other said , he must ensure the rights of the aboriginal for ensure a future economic very for the British - British . 
, the future , the Nisga' as will in legislation of expand the Lands nisga' as . 
the businesses who the interested to the opportunities of development economic on the Lands nisga' as with that the Nisga' as are owners of these Lands . 
this is this that means the text of the preamble of the agreed final who specific that the agreed must you a certainty regarding the ownership and the use of the Lands and of the resources . 
those who the opposed to the Agreement final nisga' has now of we do losing that . 
I say to my fellow of the British - British that that not is not acceptable . 
a report the public in 1991 by Price Waterhouse would to the conclusion that the claims land not résolues in British - British had cost to the province 1 billion of $ in investment and 1 500 jobs in the only sectors of the Forestry and of the mines . 
the cost for the aboriginal is also very high in reason of the constraint who the exercise on their opportunities of development economic . 
in existing of a agreed final and includes regarding all the claims nisga' as to the regard of the rights and 1993 aboriginal , the Nisga' as receive a regulation who includes 196,1 million of $ paid on a period of 15 years and a territory of about 2 $ kilometres square in the Valley of the Nass , transfer who includes the rights of greater and of and of the under - soil and also a right of cueillir a share of the conserving of salmon of the saying Nass and of the animals poses of the region of the Nass . 
however , not justified not faith to the comments tendancieux of some who argue that he there will a transfer in cash of more of 500 million of $ . 
this not is absolutely not the case . 
who can neat fully this that represents for the Nisga' as the fact of be on a lease covered strong ? 
the Nisga' as feel that this agreed their give the possible , through to the efforts that they consentiront and to their skills , of become self on the plan economic . 
a tribe nisga' has prosperous exercerait a enormous effect multiplicateur on the together of the economy of the North - west of the British - British as the knows the mayor of Terrace . 
of the notice of some Columbians - Columbians , he at better let to the courts the be of the deal on the claims aboriginal . 
this is a false belief . 
he would onéreux and vorace of time of approach to the courts for examine each claims of a right or of a as aboriginal for each place in British - British . 
in the case Delgamuukw , the Court Supreme of the Canada has treaty of the disadvantages of the point to the courts and supported that the negotiating issues the better way of solve these problems . 
some of between you the recall can - be that the case Delgamuukw is life during ten years before the courts and that , in across of blistering , the Court Supreme of the Canada has ordered the held of a new trial . 
he rest still of the uncertainty as to the rights aboriginal of the Gitskan and Wet' suwet' in who were CANBAT to this case . 
the certainty who the acquiescence of the treaty nisga' has shows clear the benefits of the negotiating by report to the point to the court . 
for achieve the objective government to stop a solution practice and being , the Agreement final nisga' has for of the arrangements by with certainty this that he in is of the ownership and of the use of the Lands and resources in the Valley of the Nass . 
he is very important of out that the all the is own in the framework legal Canadian . 
the negotiations of the Agreement final nisga' has not had not for subject of define the rights of the Nisga' as , but rather to to end to the uncertainty in explicitant , of the way the more clear and the more specific possible , all the rights some to the clause 35 that the Nisga' as will exercise a time that the Agreement final nisga' has will been concluded . 
in the past , the Canada has from a form of certainty in drafts of the rights aboriginal not définis against of the rights définis derogate of treated by the point to of the words as " CPAs " or " abandon " . 
the objections of the Nations Nations to this technical of the divestiture waste the barrier Main to the conclusion of treated modern . 
the Agreement final nisga' has resolution a approach represents on the " amendment of the rights " . 
according the approach refer of the right aboriginal amended , the rights aboriginal of the Nisga' as , there including the as , subsistent , but reticent , pursuant to the benchmarks much and other out in the Agreement final nisga' has . 
that has been the possible through to the agreed of the three parties and to the year of the powers devise of the governments federal and provincial . 
and therefore , all the rights aboriginal that the Nisga' has did under the regime of way way will reticent and cognizant the form of the rights out in the Agreement final nisga' has . 
the technical to to promote the certainty what therefore by the acceptance of the rights rather that their bill . 
if , in despite of the Agreement final and of the Act on the Agreement final nisga' has , he is a right aboriginal other that the rights of the clause 35 of the nation nisga' has out in the Agreement final nisga' has or which the explicit are different , this right will abolish to be of the date of into in into of the bill . 
in under of the new approach to the regard of the rights aboriginal , the only rights that would the Nisga' as in under of the clause 35 would those out in the Agreement final . 
honourable senators , I think that we can see the compromise , the arrangements and the Conference of the different points of view who allow the negotiating of approaches modern and réalisables to the regard of questions difficult . 
the fact that the businesses , the groups who have of the interests in the resources , the governments local and the unions support the new model of the rights shows that the . has the the of their interests to the table of the negotiations . 
several detractors and opponent of the Agreement final nisga' has seem not not be these by the facts . 
, the place of that , they déforment the truth for do vibrer of the string sensibles in view of to a reaction not of the share of the public . 
the senators are to the aware of this who the is past in the other place where the Opposition official , the Party Reform , has tried of the do . 
honourable senators , a of the criticism their of this treaty is the Leader of the Opposition official in British - British , Mr. Denise Campbell . 
this last has admitted : in the memory to the committee Standing of the other place : 
the people of British - British want of the treated who concilient the rights of the Peoples aboriginal protected by the Constitution with the sovereignty of the Crown . 
they want negotiate of the regulations because that that is better to of the regulations mobile by of the courts . 
honourable senators , this is exactly this that we we fact . 
Mr. . Campbell claims that the Act on the Agreement final nisga' has creates a new order of government to the Canada and that , by therefore , he represents a amendment to the Constitution who must be Before to the people of the British - British by seaway of referendum under the regime of the bill provincial in into to of obtain the approval of the majority . 
he has was a action for do speak the courts and in obtain a interpretation . 
the parties to the agreed and the constitutional who have before during of hearings pensioners feel that the deal Mr. Campbell not has no touchstone constitutional . 
I like quote of new the Minister of the Affairs Indian and of the North Canadian who , in the ability to the other place the 26 October last , has said : 
the Agreement nisga' has is of a great importance and he any of out that he has been concluded in the framework constitutional present of the Canada . 
the Agreement nisga' has is a arrangement practice who define the rights that the nation nisga' has exercera to the words of the clause 35 of the Act constitutional of 1982 . 
these rights will certainly protected in under various clause 35 , but that not means not that they will absolus . 
the courts have confirmed that these rights can be enfreints if that the only . 
honourable senators , the treaty nisga' has specific this who following : 
the Agreement not amend not the Constitution of the Canada , including the distribution of the powers between the Canada and the British - British . 
the 23 November , then that the dean Peter Hogg and the professor Patrick Monahan , of the Faculty of right Osgoode Hall , témoignaient before the committee Standing of the other place , the professor Monahan has said : : 
therefore , in biggest , my Position is that lesparagraphes 35 ( 1 ) and 35 ( 3 ) of the Constitution at specifically the process who is in are of the dérouler , to know that a agreed is concluded between a people aboriginal , the government federal and / or a province . 
more far , the professor Monahan add : 
that not means not that the agreements in itself are part of the Constitution of the Canada , but rather that the rights who in clauses are protected and that any bill , federal or provincial , who would contrary to the rights derogate of the treaty must satisfy to the criterion of excuse set by the courts when a right sufficient by the clause 35 is breached , criterion who has been set in the case Sparrow . 
in summary , honourable senators , nothing in the bill Bill C - 9 not has the less influence on the distribution of the powers accorded to the government federal and to the provinces by the Constitution Canadian . 
their power legislative remains changed . 
he not fact no doubt that this question will factual a day by of the authorities more senior placées that those that I just of quote . 
. criticized also to the bill of bill of be based on the race . 
by example , the Dr. by Martin , member Reform of Esquimalt - Juan of Fuca has wrote in a clause parule 24 November 99 in the daily The Ottawa Citizen : 
we considerations a sentiment of animosity and of the legislation who recall the Africa of the South of the time of the apartheid . 
in the same clause , he unless this who following : 
he must also there have a bill for all . 
however , to the over of the hearing that I I having all to the time , the professor Bradford Morse , of the Faculty of right of the University of Ottawa , has said : 
the question fundamental who 730 to well of the criticism , this is that the aboriginal not are not recognized as a group distinct in under of the race , but , as the court Supreme of the States - United the has repeatedly clear to again occasions during to the least 170 years , some Peoples have their own territories since of the time immémoriaux , in as that Nations proposing to their own systems legal , cultural , church , linguistic and policy ... this who reflects their difference as entities political , and not as groups raciaux . 
honourable senators , the rights accorded to the Nisga' as in under of the clause 35 of our Constitution are based on their presence before the arrived of the Europeans in the Valley of the Nass , and not on of the reasons picnic , as some the have left hear . 
this self government i of the rights based on the presence before the arrived of the Europeans and she is carefully designed for that the rights and the interests of the other Canadians , in particular those who live in the region immediate , be treated properly . 
all the rights to the ownership privacy are fully protected . 
all the rights to the ownership existing on of the Lands nisga' as will the subject of guideline imports or upgraded . 
all the laws federal and provincial the these , there including the laws provincial who not the apply not in the reserves Indian . 
other said , he there will more of Telecom for the woman nisga' has , by example , who not the apply not now according the Act on the Indian and the system of the reserves Indian . 
by therefore , he there has had of forth opportunities of to of the opinions on all the questions substantielles . 
of , , this process of consultation the is finally revealed be the more exhaustive and effective of any the history of the treated to the Canada . 
in the memory , Denise Campbell has also fact referring to some " concerns related to the equality in the treaty nisga' has " , leaving hear that the rule of right not will not implemented uniformément to all the people of the British - British and that those - this not will not treated also to the within of the Canada . 
the argument that that all the people of the British - British have exactly the same rights not 1 not to the provisions Constitutional who indiscriminately of the rights special for some groups . 
this point of view nierait to the Nisga' as all the rights derogate of treated and give to hear also that he not should not there have of rights aboriginal . 
in addition , this point of view " all the other rights special protected by the Constitution as the rights of the minorities , the rights to the education and the rights linguistic . 
honourable senators , the Nisga' as not should not have to abandon to their culture and to their language for live in our magnificent country . 
he is possible , to the Canada , of be to the time aboriginal and Canadian . 
the time not me allows not of to many of the questions raised by this treaty historic where the right to the self government of a people aboriginal is , for the first time , recognized by the Parliament in under of the clause 35 . 
of well of the ways , the rights of the not - Nisga' as living in territory nisga' has are améliorés by the Elimination of the restrictions cut by the Act on the Indian . 
in the of tax , the Nisga' as have agreed , in short , that their people pays of the taxes as all the other Canadians after a some period . 
same to their development economic , the Nisga' as assumeront a responsibility growing of their own funding . 
they waiting with forward of power the unable of the addiction financial . 
honourable senators , I I very forward that we 4:35 the debate on the bill of bill C - 9 . 
I believe that , when we the will examined to further , we the speaking with enthusiasm . 
I believe that Terry Glavin , a member of the Pacific kelp Resource Conservation Rehabilitation , of the British - British , has very well summary the situation when he has taken the parolele 17 November last before his fellow of the British - British and has said : 
I not doubt not that the broader majority of the Columbians - Columbians support the objective of the conclusion , with the Nations Nations , of treated who be them and reasonable and who are honour to the Crown . 
more far , he has added : 
in way of épilogue , honourable senators , I wish to out that few senators attendance today today have played a role grand to the within of the committee Joint of the House of the Commons and of the Senate on the Constitution in 1980 - 1981 , who has the of the hearings and discussed on this that is become the Act constitutional of 1982 . 
this was a period historic to the over of which the Charter of the rights , the patriation of the Constitution and of many other questions important have , collectively , changed the nature of the Canada , and in good part for the better , to my notice . 
the clause 35 the among the provisions important to been adopted to this time - that . 
a sure number of senators and of members have éprouvé a great emotion when the Minister of the Justice of the time , Jean tien , under the pressure enormous of the committee Joint , has agreed , to the behalf of the government Trudeau , of add the clause 35 to the Constitution . 
the bill of bill C - 9 represents the a of the major results of our efforts of the time . 
the committee Joint was co by fire the senator Harry Hays and by a fringant member of the Quebec , became since the fringant senator Joyal . 
I exiled then the government to the Senate , while that the former senator Duff Duff he the Opposition . 
the a of the members Standing of the other place which the attendance was copy was Eymard Corbin , today today senator . 
that the . me pardonne if I I forgotten of mention who that this be to the Senate who has sat to this committee to as of member Standing . 
in ending , I will having that a Senate which some of the members rely more of 20 years of experience has certainly a contribution useful to to in the of policy government . 
the hon. rald - A . 
honourable senators , this agreed - because he the is well of a agreed , and not of a treaty - is subject to the Constitution , to the Charter of the rights and to the Code criminal . 
that fact many . 
my only concern , and can - be could - . the examine more in full in committee , has relates to the skills prosper to the regard of the over of the Nisga' as . 
that is without precedent , in this sense that , in the system federal Canadian , he there has sharing of the powers between the federal and the provinces . 
and , the over is exercée knew by the Parliament of the Canada , knew by the legislatures legislation provincial . 
the system works very well . 
I I heard say that - and you me corrigerez if I me wrong - in some case , this who fact competition to the over not is of jurisdiction or federal or provincial ; that to can - be say that he there has of the flou someone share in the agreed . 
in the legislation where the agreed not amend not the sharing of the powers between Ottawa and the provinces , I am satisfy . 
is - this the case ? 
the senator Austin : 
I want thank the senator Beaudoin of his question . 
as I the I said in my speech , he there has a clause particular who specific that this agreed not one in nothing the distribution of the powers between the Canada and the British - British . 
and , he there has the clause 35 perpetuate the rights some in this agreed . 
these rights receive a protection constitutional , but that not one in nothing the distribution of the powers . 
the Constitution , outcome of the agreed between the government federal and the provinces , protects the rights of the aboriginal a time that the Parliament and the British - British have ratified the agreed to the way of a bill . 
the senator Beaudoin : 
I not I absolutely no problem with the clause 35 , because he give of the rights actions to the aboriginal in the Constitution of the Canada . 
I am all to fact in favour of these rights , because the aboriginal were here the first . 
my question the simply on the Domination of a power by report to a other when of the powers are Act concurremment . 
when this bill of bill will examined by a committee , I hope that . chair this question more in full . 
the rest of the agreed not me there no problem . 
the senator Austin : 
I forward with forward this study . 
the senator raises a point essential . 
I i that in some case , the powers of the Council tribal nisga' has will Domination , particularly in this who respect the rights linguistic and Cultural . 
however , they are always issues to the criterion of the uniqueness reasonable statement in the v. Sparrow , because this because fact part of our right constitutional . 
the hon. Gerald J . Comeau : 
honourable senators , I I listened carefully the speech of the senator and a of my questions the on the quota of salmon keynotes in the saying Nass . 
however , he there has a way by which the Minister and the Crown can give of the quota of fishing , be the clause 7 of the Act on the fisheries . 
the government can same create of the reserves exclusives of fishing , this who is arisen in the treaty nisga' has . 
as . the specific in the clause 7 , that must the do by the Adopted of a legislation legislative valid . 
the treaty for a zone of fishing ours who will then protégée in under of the clause 35 of the Constitution . 
by therefore , the parliamentarians céderont their power legislative with the distribution of this resources common . 
for a of the first time of the history , of the parliamentarians off to a duty , provided in the Constitution , of protect a resources public . 
the négociateurs have - they the the of this aspect or you - you had right to a sitting of information to this about ? 
the senator Austin : 
honourable senators , I not am without doubt not also well prepared that the senator Comeau to examine to this at - this the consequences exact of the licensing of the zone of fishing . 
I know that the Act on the fisheries and the regulations afférents the apply to the Hempline in under of the Agreement nisga' has . 
a plan of fishing annual must be presented and , as the has said the hon. senator Comeau , the Nisga' as have a agreed providing a right to a share specific of the crop of fish . 
, my notice , you hand a better response to your questions during the discussions in committee . 
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( Leader Deputy of the Opposition ) : 
my question the question to the senator Austin . 
the clause 35 of the Act constitutional of 1982 just all fair after the sections 1 to 34 who constitute the Charter of the rights and freedoms . 
is - he that of say that the Charter of the rights and freedoms not the applies not to the clause 35 , but that in under of this treaty , the Charter of the rights and freedoms the apply ? 
of fact , I believe that the Charter the applies in under of this agreed , this who authority a more great protection in a perspective of rights of the human that a legislation who not provincial that of the clause 35 ? 
the senator Austin : 
the senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , to the time of begin the debate on the principle of the bill of bill , I want clarification the rights that have the Indiennes in under of the bill of bill C - 31 , the amendment to the Act on the Indian who has failing the ( 12 ( 1 ) b ) of the former Act on the Indian . 
some repeatedly that the " right of réversion . " 
this right is - he used in under of the Agreement nisga' has , or the is - he of a more great or of a least great protection for the women who would 650,000 the community nisga' has ? 
the senator Austin : 
honourable senators , I not then answer to this question that in words worry , in saying that the given that the Charter the applies and that the Charter , the discrimination , I believe that the rights of the women nisga' as are now equal to those of all the other women Canadian .

the Act on the Parliament of the Canada 
bill of bill Amend - Second Reading - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the motion of the hon. senator Grafstein , seconded by the hon. senator Callbeck , Honourable to the second Reading of the bill of bill S - 5 , Act amend the Act on the Parliament of the Canada ( poet official of the Parliament ) . - ( 
the hon. senator Hays ) . 
the hon. Eymard G . Corbin : 
honourable senators , the senator Grafstein knows that I not I not many of enthusiasm for the bill of bill . 
however , I him am grateful of have before the Senate of this proposal . 
if I I well including , the bill of bill S - 5 is to institutionnaliser the poetry in proposing a poet official of the Parliament . 
however , puisqueMon time not me has not for of me prepare as I the would désiré for express my was . 
the senator Grafstein me press since 48 p.m. of take the speak before the adjournment of the illiteracy to that this bill of bill can be referred to a committee for study and audition of witnesses of the thought , I me reducing today today of the satisfy , but this not will not necessarily my last word . 
he has had the time of write the discour , of there think , of take of the notice and of receive board . 
he has had of the months for this do . 
he would now that the few people to the Parliament who live and mangent literature the précipitent abracadabrant in the twofold of the enthusiasm . 
he must know yet that the process of the production independent , which he him so sometimes of as his the amount , ask of the time for the research , the reflection and the drafting . 
finally , I accommoderai the hon. senator since the had of the ideas not is never in itself a year futile . 
that said , I hear now that the debate will adjourned after my remarks . 
as by accident , but what pleased coincidence , I relisais in end of week Edgar Allan Poe , his life and his literature , a wrote of Charles Baudelaire 115 of 1852 . 
I I for these two monuments littéraires that are these two great poètes , that I not I never up of attend to the over of the years , a admiration illimitée . 
I am therefore biaisé , advised - the . 
however , I retrouvais this sentence of the with of Baudelaire , and I quote : 
Alfred of Vigny has wrote a book , ( Stello , 1832 ) for shown that the place of the poetry not is or in a république , or in a monarchy simultaneously , or in a monarchy constitutional ... ... ... 
and Baudelaire add : 
... ... ... and human not him has answered . 
Stello canada a point of view well particular , that I sharing almost fully . 
I not I not the time , for the reason namely to the beginning of my comments , of enter in the detail . 
for be an , and without argue that Stello can be transposé mutatis mutandis of the situation of the poetry of 1830 to the who prevails to our time , he there has a consideration fundamental to clerical , of the least I the think . 
he said : 
from the life poétique of the life policy . 
and for there , : 
let to César this who is to César , this is - to - say the right of be to each time of each day honni in the street , was in the palais , fought sourdement , miné length , fought handcuff and gone violemment . 
second prescription of the Murder Noir to the poet : 
only and free , accomplish his mission . 
follow the conditions of the be , administration of the influence of the Associations , same the more talk . 
because that the Solitude only is the source of the inspirations . 
and I in what many , the essential the statement . 
the essential , this is the nature same of the work of creation poétique that . not cannot embrigader . 
a versificateur , a rimeur up to the verset , yes , can - be , but not a authentique poet - that never ! 
I not then me imagine that a poet in the soul would the emprisonner in the carcan that there the word official . 
in fact , he must question the question of a other way , he me seems . 
what is the border between the say and the power ? 
I you say that she is of the minceur of the leaves of the guillotine who décolleta é Chénier , poet . 
I you say also that this border the did jadis under the form of the Index Roman or of the court who condamna the poet of Baudelaire , who in bloody as of other . 
that you give only a very small idea , for out that the poetry not must nothing of the all to the Césars , to the Popes , to the empereurs , to the despotes of all acabit . 
and this is to the honour of the poet . 
today today , the border between the say and the policy is also distante that the space who harsh of his land proud the poet exilé and persécuté . 
I not I unfortunately not had the time of read the comments of my hon. friend , the senator Kinsella . 
I the will during the adjournment , after the illiteracy . 
I believe however , for have heard the any end of the speech of the other day , that he baigne in a nostalgia surannée . 
I me in will a better idea under little , and if I I difficulty interpretation the comments , I determine me in apologize . 
I consider that the proposal of the senator Grafstein has a it of moisi victorien , and I me apologize of the say in presence of the joli buste who his the before of this Room of legislative , fair beyond - that of your head , Honour the . 
that is - he came of our ability of dream , of our talents of explorateurs ? 
this is as if we , Canadians , were still écartelés beyond - that of a abîme without further and also broader that the coast who we harsh of our mothers patries ; écartelés between our past and our challenges . 
the hang to a practice or to a poised vacuum of sense would - he a other event of our insécurité national ? 
this is as if we roof of mature for innover . 
are - we to this point déficients ? 
I thought , but am - I illusionné , that our tradition democratic Corel for we unable of the carcans and of the ways of be to the world regards . 
I not about not for the poet , I timely a conviction his .

the Ontario 
the bill of bill on the restructuring regional - - refusal of declare Ottawa formally bilingual - Inquiry - Suspended of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the inquiry of the hon. senator Poulin , calling the attention of the Senate on the decision of the government of the Ontario of not not adopt a recommendation to to do of Ottawa a city bilingual after his restructuring proposed . - ( 
the hon. senator Fraser ) . 
the hon. Joan Fraser : 
honourable senators , when I rise the speak here to the House , I trying in General of use the two languages official . 
today today however , I me exprimerai in English only for insist my Senators to the of all those who exhortent the government of the Ontario to adopt a bill before that the new great city of Ottawa will formally bilingual . 
I me adresserai to you in English only because that I believe that he is important of recognize that this is a question who respect all the Canadians , the English , the francophones , those that we lifelong to the Quebec the allophones and the aboriginal , that they speak the two languages official or only a or same no of the two . 
he there has good number of reasons for which the city of Ottawa , and not only the region of the capital national who is to the government federal , should be formally bilingual . 
the first , who the at to the plan human , this is that a great number of francophones there live , 125 $ I believe . 
I know this that that means of see the own government hesitate to recognize the legitimacy of his community linguistic , the right to be whose to share full for this that she is , this is - to - say a attribut of a of the Peoples founding of this country . 
I know this that that means of hear the government provincial say someone something of the kind " Regardez as we you people well . 
you invitations be grateful for all these good things that we do for you . 
not are particularly not to be recognized for this that you are . 
not you watch not to this that . you would of the rights . 
what Appendix in bad - . ? 
that fact difficulty , honourable senators . 
that you give the Appendix that home you , in your own province , not are not considered as a citizen to share full same if your ancestors have contributed to build this country and that the Constitution from your language as the a of the two languages official of the country . 
honourable senators , we know all that , since a generation , the governments beneficial successive , there including the government present , have worked of the efforts biodegradable for to on at and offer a broader wide of services of language French and for help the francophones to build and to control their institutions community essential . 
well that we regrettions can - be all profoundly the situation to the Health sought and that we espérions can - be , as I the am , that she will resolved of way satisfactorily , he is also important of recognize that the government summer present has taken the initiative of give to the francophones the control of the schools French . 
this not is not nothing . 
I in so tribute to the government of the Ontario . 
we understand all that we done here , to the Parliament federal and that , to the Canada , the municipalities matters of the jurisdiction of the provinces . 
we know that the creation of the mégaville is a case of jurisdiction provincial . 
he not there has surely no of between we who the challenging . 
this is also humoured that Ottawa is a case Special . 
this is a pay Ontario , certainly , but this not is not a pay as the other , because Ottawa and Ottawa only is the capital national . 
the region of the capital national not is not the capital . 
this is a region , a nice region , created and appropriately as he must , a wonderful recognition geographical of the importance of the capital for all the Canadians ; but Ottawa , the city of Ottawa , is the capital . 
, the Canada , we we two languages official . 
this is a aspect basic of our history , of our existence as country . 
this is a of the pillars of our identity and of our political national . 
how the can - he that the capital of the country not should not the this fact wonderful ? 
what message that does he to the Canadians , not only to the francophones but to all the Canadians , when we say that , same if we we two languages official , only the a of they is really official here , in the capital she - same ? 
honourable senators , the spring last , he me has been given of visit Bruxelles , the capital of a country to the taken with of the problems linguistic who relèguent the ourselves to of the up of children . 
I am sure that you know that the Belgium is divided in cantons French and flamands , but , formally , in practice and of by his laws , Bruxelles is a city bilingual . 
he should in be and and we should we in sustains . 
of such would that , if we insist for that the city of Ottawa be bilingual , we must also insist for that the of Hull the be also . 
that raises a problem of resort provincial . 
in as that Québécoise of language English , I then wish uphill that the government of the Quebec would to Hull the status official of city bilingual , as he the has fact for of other municipalities , there including the where I ahead . 
but that not respect in nothing the city of Ottawa . 
I am sure , honourable senators , that we we all been delighted of learn that the pay of Ottawa has asked to the government of the Ontario of recognize to this é - city the status of city bilingual . 
I believe know that only the government provincial can recognize this status to a pay Ontario . 
he there has had of the precedents before the courts to this effect . 
we know that some as opposed a resistance to this legislation . 
any the resistance active which I am to the aware just of English , and a great part of this resistance seems the express by the fear , a fear of the consequences that the status bilingual of the capital national could have for the English who live to Ottawa . 
well course , many of people are the change and sometimes , this fear is valid ; however , a little of change is positive . 
a little of change allows of build a future better for our country and for we all , who are so he of in be the citizens . 
we can happen to embrasser this change . 
I think to my parents , of the English of the Nova - Nova , proud of their roots , who remontaient to 200 years in our country . 
they not have never spoke French . 
as that I far , no of their ancestors not spoke French , the gaélique , yes , but not the French . 
when my parents were young , the question of the bilingualism and of the Bilingualism not pointait same not to the year . 
in the years 60 , when the Canada English has finally including this part of the history , of the identity and of the future of our country , my parents have been among the million of Canadians English to the understand them also and to the outlining of the identity bilingual and biculturelle of our country . 
they not have not learned the French , but they have fact in so that I the apprenne , because they thought that all the Canadians who in had the possible should speak the two languages of the Canada . 
they were proud that I my learned the French . 
I their am éternellement grateful of me in have offered the possible . 
why we of the flags , by example , if the symbolisme not is not important ? 
the symbolisme is a something extremely important for we all . 
and where is - this more important that in the capital of the country ? 
finally , I suggestion that if Ottawa not is not a city as the other , the Ontario is a province not as the other . 
she has always contributed to several of the elements of our identity which we are if proud - the tolerance , the opening of spirit , the balance which we we targuons . 
I urge therefore the government of the Ontario , a time still , of assume the role historic of Leader of leadership . 
as we the we heard in this chamber today today and the days precedents , . is in are of study very seriously of other Ways for that Ottawa that the status of city bilingual that she deserves , to my notice . 
a action in justice is the by our colleague , the hon. senator Joyal , without doubt the more infatigable advocate of the rights of the minorities that we flagrant . 
he is question that the government federal ruined . 
the he must in happen that , that he in be and , but he would so more better that the government of the Ontario the this that have fact as of his predecessors before him , that he states the leadership and sits the role historic who is of the show the proud protector of this that he there has of better to the Canada . 
I urge of all my heart the government of the Ontario to to the of the supplications of this House and of as of Canadians .

the Ontario 
the bill on the restructuring regional - - refusal of the government summer of adopt the recommendation to to do of Ottawa a city bilingual - Inquiry - Continued of the debate 
the order of the day Order : 
resuming of the debate on the inquiry of the hon. senator Poulin , calling the attention of the Senate on the decision of the government of the Ontario of not not adopt a recommendation to to do of Ottawa a city bilingual after his restructuring proposed . - ( 
the hon. senator Fraser ) . 
the hon. rald - A . 
honourable senators , the Canada is a federation bilingual and originators , and that the recognize our various laws Constitutional of 1867 to our days . 
he is in the order of the things that the capital of this country be also bilingual . 
several States federal have a capital bilingual , even same multilingue . 
he is exactly that to the words of the Constitution Canadian , the municipalities matters of the jurisdiction provincial , according the ) 92 ( 8 ) of the Act constitutional of 1867 . 
this is say that the structures and the powers of a board City are the attribut of the provinces . 
. must respect the sharing of the powers . 
however , Ottawa not is not a city as the other , this is the capital of the Canada . 
and to the heart of this country , the major institutions federal are bilingual : the Parliament federal , the Court Supreme of the Canada , Rideau Hall and the departments . 
a clause of the Constitution of the Canada , the clause 16 , with of the capital of the Canada and unless that the seat of the government federal is to Ottawa . 
in the v. Munro of 1966 , the Court Supreme of the Canada has recognized that the Parliament federal can legislation on the capital national in under of his jurisdiction résiduelle in under of the clause : peace , order and good government . 
in this case , the Court Supreme has recognized that the Parliament federal can create a region of the capital national , tough a Board of the capital national and habiliter this commission to them of the land for the embellissement of the capital national . 
this Board of the capital national is Before to the Act on the languages official since she is a body created by a bill federal . 
the bill federal on the languages official , who the on a at of equality the use of the language English and of the language French in the institutions federal , based on the jurisdiction résiduelle of the Parliament Canadian , as the has establishes the v. Jones of 1975 , a judgment unanimous of our more senior court . 
the part VII of the Act on the languages official allows a some extension of the bilingualism and has more that a value déclaratoire in right , she has a value required . 
he there has therefore , according the Constitution , a sure sharing of the powers in the area who we concern . 
the clause 16 of the Act constitutional of 1867 has been interpretation libéralement and , to my notice , . must continue to the do . 
some legal have already examined the question of a real District federal , as to Washington and several other capitales federal . 
they have examined the question of a capital on the two settle of the River , and also the question of a District federal on the two settle . 
I not want not open this debate today today , because he not is not now before we . 
this who is before we , however , this is the question of a capital bilingual , or more or least . 
this is already many . 
my colleague , the senator Serge Joyal , has invoqué , to the support of the pleas in favour of a capital bilingual , the principles identified by the Court Supreme in the referred on the Darrel of the Quebec , for encadrer the negotiations between the Quebec and the Canada or between a province and the Canada , this is - to - say the constitutionnalisme , the democracy , the rule of right , the respect of the rights of the minorities and the federalism . 
if . can point these principle to the opportunity of a Darrel , they can certainly be confined for the renewal of the federalism . 
I end my statement legal on the remarks of the Justice Cartwright , in the v. Munro , in which this lawyer invoquait the theory of the interest national : 
I can to imagine the subject of a legislation legislative who today more clear the interests local or provincial and who interest more the Canada in the together that the of the development , of the legislation and of the improvement of the region of the capital national . 
the Justice Jean Beetz , in the referred on the Act anti - inflation of 1976 , wrote that : 
. will without doubt that he there has a difference between the capital and the region of the capital . 
I conclude that the capital of our country the must of be bilingual . 
of the Senators : 
hear ! 
the hon. Serge Joyal : 
honourable senators , I I listened with many of interest the statement of the senator Beaudoin . 
I like to to the attention a distinction on the deal regarding the part VII of the Act on the languages official that the committee on the languages official has had the opportunity of study . 
the senator Gauthier , this week , me transmettait a information on the nature specific of the partieVII. 
you you supported that the part VII had a uniqueness locks , and not only déclaratoire . 
now , a because in Court federal challenging specifically the nature of the uniqueness déclaratoire of the part VII of the Act on the languages official . 
as she not is not couverte by the sections of the bill who deal of the point court possible , this part of the bill 730 to the review and to the order of the courts Canadian . 
I not am not of this notice in the context of reference of the Court Supreme on the Darrel of the Quebec . 
this question has been raised by the senator Gauthier by her the Speaker good tempore to as of co of the committee on the languages official . 
this question fact now the subject of a debate before the courts . 
, the time where . in what to the step of the plaidoiries , the arguments développés by the Court Superior of the Ontario , in the because of the Health sought , will their ( for the Court federal who will to the deal of way to clarification a time for all the application real of the part VII of the Act on the languages official . 
as you the know , she would of a so importance for define the responsibility of the government Canadian to the regard of the role of promotion active to the support of the minorities of languages official English or French . 
I wanted to to the attention of the hon. senator this part important that the senators Gauthier and Cool - Cool have underlined in their trade to the about of the business of this committee . 
the senator Beaudoin : 
honourable senators , in the further , we wish the same something . 
if this is challenged , . hope that this will rejected and that . will to the part VII of the Act on the languages official a value not simply déclaratoire , but also impérative . 
that me remind always the " v. on the clause 133 , in which a court supply had said that the use of the French and of the English was indicatif and not imperative . 
the Court Supreme , in a decision of 9 to 0 , had corrected the involved in saying that : when the Constitution about of way clear and specific , this is imperative . 
we we battons all for the same result . 
this is challenged , but this is our regime . 
. can do point of the arguments very strong for argue that this Act on the languages official has a uniqueness imperative to the partieVII. 
he must try of do point our arguments to the court . 
the hon. Ione Christensen : 
honourable senators , this is in as that CIBC unilingual that I rise in the debate on the decision of the government of the Ontario of not not give the to a recommendation to to declare region bilingual the city restructured of Ottawa . 
from of the out of the Canada located the more to the Western , I find futile the idea same of to this debate . 
the capital of the Canada not can that be bilingual . 
the Canada and the bilingualism are seldom ; they not are that a . 
since 1898 , the Yukon has a community French very active and proud . 
today today , his members are represented by the Association French yukonnaise . 
he there has a school French and the rate of fréquentation of the programs of immersion in French in our system of education is very high . 
of the Canadians of across are came to the Yukon for that their children learn and shared this great culture bilingual . 
the question not provincial or of a pay , or of a province or of a jurisdiction tax . 
this is a question of unity . 
the reaction of the province contiguë to the who the the more strong people of Canadians francophones is incredibly insensitive . 
this not was not necessary . 
Ottawa , our capital national , should the our duality and we not can accept nothing of least . 
the hon. Marcel homme man : 
honourable senators , he there has had a agreement . 
the recommendations of the Board Royal on the Peoples aboriginal relatively to the service government aboriginal

the hon. senator Nino Nino ) . 
the hon. Marjory LeBreton : 
honourable senators , to as of chairman - chairman of the committee Senate Standing of the Affairs Social , of the Science and of the Technology , I like comment briefly the motion . 
he not is not indifférent that the few the words who will speeches to the Senate during this millennium them on this about . 
that falls to point appointed , because , to the enter of the new millennium , we will the Authorized of the Senate for study the of of the services of health to the Canada and in do report . 
this study the is of emergency , and the Senate is particularly well put for wasn this study , if . the am to the Commons , where of other factors bother often this type of work . 
honourable senators , as all the other members of the committee , I support this initiative . 
the question deserves a study serious . 
he there has many of ideas false répandues to the about of the services of health to the Canada . 
we must do opposite to of many realities . 
we must we question on the role of the government federal and the ways to take for to the system economically viable . 
I ask respectfully the Authorized of do this study . 
the the the Speaker good tempore : 
there has he of other senators who wish take the speak ? 
the hon. Michael Kirby : 
honourable senators , I me in tiendrai to two brief comments . 
all of first , to the light of the debates who have had place to the Senate the week last on the costs of the study , I digress that the committee not contemplated not of spending more of 10 $ $ of here to the 31 March 2000 . 
then , for this who respect the next year , this not will not a study angry little , because we we propose of do the most of our comparaisons international to the way of visioconférences who , as has could the see the committee of the Banking , working extremely well . 
same if the framework of reference is broader , I not me forward not to this that this study be angry little . 
finally , honourable senators , I wish to present a observation on the way which we hope manage this study . 
I believe that the senator Carstairs , in issue of the way which the committee has treaty the bill of bill C - 6 , has fact out that , rigoureusement issue , our committee steering the up of two Liberal and of a Conservative . 
of the same manner , when the committee steering has began to establish the framework of reference of this study , we we asked to the senator Keon of the join to we . 
the senator Keon has
